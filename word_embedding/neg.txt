ok i get it people dont really care about good film making ultimately and there is something that people responded to in this film but i dont know what it could be i read all the books and really enjoyed them the books should translate to a film fairly well they are practically written as a screenplay but even saying that i did not watch this film expecting a match to the book or even a perfect matching of the characters i was ready to just see a good film regardless of how true to the book they were this is not even worthy of being called a film it is some kind of cheap presentation something youd see at a tourist attraction in a crappy little theater where someone shook the seats and sprayed mist in the air under the premise you were watching a senseorama demonstration horrible screenwriting horrible acting horrible casting non existant cinematography editing that feels like the result of some kind of computer algorithm that just mixes up shots randomly to music and dialogue and seriously low budget visual fx at least those crappy transformer films get the fx right there is no film making craft visible in this picture it needs to be categorized as something else its not even on par with cheap and cheesy tv movie of the week style story telling this is barely on par with most video game cut scenes if you have any respect or admiration for cinema craft do not waste your time sitting through this abomination 
im sorry this movie does not explore relationships well and the books are all about relationships yes there is plenty of action in the books but you dont know why in the movies why all of this is so important what the ties are between these people or what motivates them important events are left out i just found this movie drab the shaky cam filming at the beginning annoying and i just wanted it to be over i saw at the theater with my daughter she didnt like the movie either sorry the hunger games fans i didnt like it that is not to insult you because i thoroughly enjoyed the books 
i tried to enjoy this movie but cant for teenagers maybe this movie has an appeal but i dont think it works for more mature audience myself included i really cant find anything interesting about this movie the storyline is flat plots are weak and the characters are dull a bunch of kids and teenagers are prepared into fight to the death survival games and hardly we can see pyschological battles inside each of the characters although the story may have an interesting premise to begin with but the whole production is half baked and lacking in so many areas if this is supposed to be a suspense movie i really cant feel it the romance part is cheesy and the actions are lame many scenes are so superficial and do not make sense the shaky camera work really makes things even worse so is this a really bad movie it is for me but really theres no accounting for taste just watch it and see if i have summed it up to your favor 
kiddish best describes this movie with its thread line that adults are stupid self absorbed warring fools and kids are somehow bright intelligent and well reasoned is designed and purposed for information warfare against unsuspecting minds the willie wonka styles worn by adults are distracting and annoying at best the battle ground is managed remotely through technology by game planners in order to direct the game in interesting ways for the adult audience who ever dreamed up this nonsense should be psychologically evaluated and committed the message that war is an innate trait in humans and in order to avoid wars in the natural world the innate need can be fulfilled through entertainment is nonsense the twist of denying the audience of their need through mutually assured destruction m a d is utterly looney the fact that an inexperienced kid comes up with this novel solution is beyond fantasy and that adults twist it again into m a d for love is even more nutty the stylistic approach of the movie impresses me as being of asian origins and minds romeo and juliet was more entertaining at least in that movie juliets boobs can be seen the movie is out of touch with the true human condition and conveys no redeeming message 
after reading the three book series at the recommendation of my four grandchildren and enjoying the books tremendously i looked forward to the release of this dvd what a let down the film was just awful very poor adaptation of a wonderful book 
i was interested to see this movie brought to me by the lovely partnering of amazon and roku but what a disappointment i couldnt tell if it was deliberately comedic or just such an overwrought silly story line that it was aimed at a much younger age group tweens the plot revolves around tributes children aged who are brought to the utopian dystopian capital of a nation to fight to the death for the entertainment of the watching masses think survivor but much less forgiving now aside from the utterly absurd idea that anyone would ever do this or would watch it this plot has gigantic holes that you could drive a hummer through the main character does things like make a fire and feed a smaller girl one of her competitors to be the one to live despite knowing full well that other contestants have been tracked and killed by lighting fires when another contestant is killed the heroine takes the time to lay her out collect flowers and decorate her poor corpse with them despite the fact that shes still being hunted by a pack of competitors uh really shes supposed to be in what any professional pilot would call a mission critical environment every action has potential consequences but she behaves like she is on survivor and some host will be along any second to fix the situation theres some very callous and questionable actions is she genuinely interested in her co star from her district or simply using him for the benefit of the all present cameras and as i said not even in a jaded world can i conceive of anyone thinking a television show where child contestants beat each others brains out is a viable prospect the movie just stops doesnt end and its abundantly clear that theres other movies to come to finish the lame storyline which of course will have some monumental revolution started because of some action by this girl who quite honestly pretty much didnt deserve to survive i found it impossible to suspend disbelief not even the mighty stanley tucci whom i adore could save this piece of dreck woody harrelson is actually the best actor in the piece saying a lot and delivered on his role although it didnt seem to be much of a stretch donald sutherland seems to be phoning it in playing the ubiquitous evil leader the stormtroopers are dressed like well stormtroopers everything is so cliched so predictable so hackneyed wont be looking for either the sequel movies nor will i be reading the books truly glad that i didnt pay to watch this 
wheres the story why do these people want to watch year olds kill each other why is society split between psychopaths with crazy hairdos living in the year and seemingly normal people living in the th century is that will smiths son or is that a girl oh i guess it doesnt matter now because he she is already dead are the cgi computer dogs computer generated by the computer forest or are they supposed to be real dogs made by the computer forest and if the cgi computer dogs are cgi then is the cgi city a real city or a computer manifested city is this like the matrix the computer dogs must be cgi within cgi because the deer at the beginning was real at least it wasnt as bad as the equally overrated battle royale if youre over years of age and your neurological development hasnt already been retarded by an overexposure to young adult fiction titles like the hunger games then you probably wont like this movie its just that bad 
although the acting was pretty good by not all but most of the actors the movie itself is heinous and a true teenagers blood bath in a world full of violence everywhere a world without any true christian values we are presented here with another romantic bloody teenagers movie then we wonder why our society is in the condition that it is in i for myself had enough of violence in the movies as i said there is already plenty of it in the real world but to each its own if this movie grossed about million dollars it is definitely a very sad illustration of the sick society we live in you enjoyed it good for you you will find this dvd in my trash bin at home 
the beginning is boring and it doesnt even explain the backround of the movie to tell you the truth i fell asleep watching this movie and that says alot cause im a big movie fanatic dont know whats all the hoopla over this movie
strictly off of my opinion this movie was a overhyped reguritated hollywood story about young love and violence its setting was very strange it started off in the district that looked like it was an undeveloped third world country and then came the spaceships after the selection the kids get on a super technogolical bullet train with crystal chandeliers tons of food and wait wait wait what it was remeniscent of a spin off of a sci fi german holocaust the first hour and fifteen minutes were painfully tetious giving nothing but a boring dialogue of how to survive an hour and minutes in thats when you start to see any sign of action but by that time you will probably be asleep i read the first book it was decently written but they ruined the movie with some more book related changes this could have been corrected and made the movie decent but still not worth buying do yourself a favor instead of paying bucks rent it and see if you like it i know i was glad i did 
naturally the movie isnt as good as the book thats usually the case and we all know that going in its unrealistic to expect the movie to be just as good as the book however i suppose i had higher expectations for this movie going in because of peter jacksons work on the lotr trilogy my thought was that since peter jackson could condense such a complex world into such good movies couldnt an experienced screenwriter author such as suzanne collins author of the books themselves which are nowhere near as complex as the world or story in lotr could do the same not quite apparently clearly an effort was made to bridge the gap between book and movie i would have given the theatrical movie stars it was worth seeing because the actors gave wonderful performances and it had a visual impact that the book didnt as well as scenes that were not in the book that enhanced the story it doesnt stand on its own though its more of a companion to the novel like illustrated pictures that move and speak however they cut scenes from the dvd that were in the movie some that had been in the book and some that were not but all things that made the movie worth seeing everything certainly would have fit on the disc so i just cannot make sense of why they were cut from the dvd initially the thing that annoyed me about the movie was the loss of the true story of the mockingjay pin however there are some things in the movie that were either not in or you couldnt get from the book the real reason to watch the movie is to get a visual representation of the books scenes not because children killing children is at all glamorous or fun its not its because while its horrific enough to read about the full horror comes home to you when you see it played out on screen its a little like the difference between hearing about the titanic sinking and watching the movie titanic but more like the difference between hearing about the holocaust and watching schindlers list or hearing about slavery and watching roots but i have to go back to the pin so much is made of the pin in the book that i cant understand why they changed its story in the movie i certainly dont understand how they could refer to it as if it were something of a good luck charm after the way it was used in the movie katniss finds it randomly in the hob and gives it to her sister prim for protection right before prims first reaping immediately thereafter prim whose name is only entered once in the reaping is chosen as tribute from among hundreds of names prim then gives the pin back to katniss for protection in the games really after the poor protection the pin gave prim thats more like a sinister greek tragedy than sisterly love after prim was chosen they should have thrown the thing into the fire at mount doom that plot change was ridiculous because it was completely changed and diminished in the movie the real story of the pin isnt even a spoiler unless you havent read and still plan to read the books this is the actual story of the pin if your first instinct is to roll your eyes let me ask you this can you imagine the lord of the rings with the story of the one ring changed and gollum cut out again this next part is only a spoiler if you havent read the book because its not in either of the first movies released so far hunger games or catching fire at all the mockingjay pin was actually a fine gold piece of jewelry that belonged to a classmate acquaintance of katniss named madge madge wore it the day of the reaping and wasnt chosen as tribute then rather urgently gave it to katniss during katniss allotted goodbye visits before leaving for the games before madge it belonged to madges aunt maysilee maysilee was a young woman chosen as tribute for the hunger games in a reaping the same year as haymitch was years earlier in the nd quarter quell that year twice the number of tributes were sent into the arena madges mother and her aunt maysilee were twin sisters and both were good friends with katniss mother in school as well maysilee turned out to be handy with a blowpipe and poison darts she found in her backpack in the arena she actually saves haymitchs life at one point in the games after he stumbled into a pack of careers they allied for a while after that until she decided they should go their separate ways not relishing the thought of having to kill each other if it came down to them as the last two shortly after they split up she was attacked by some huge pelican like birds that fatally stabbed her neck and while haymitch was too far away to help he still came back to hold her hand and comfort her while she was dying haymitch wins his games by outsmarting the game makers he stays off by himself when not allied with maysilee not provoking fights not killing unless necessary to defend himself until he is one of the final two survivors when it comes to their big showdown he throws a hatchet into a force field and it flies back up and into his opponent killing her therefore the kill that won him the game was not caused by a direct act on his part the game killed her for him because of that and because he did not gleefully participate in the games by hunting down and savagely killing his opponents he shows up the capitol and is punished his mother brother and girlfriend are all killed off in separate accidents and haymitch comes to realize that anyone he cares about will be killed so he retreats into life as a loner who cares about no one in order to keep more people from being killed slowly sinking into alcoholism each year hes forced to watch as his districts tributes are targeted and killed off then katniss comes along wearing a pin that belonged to maysilee with not only the skills to win the game but the spunk to show up the capitol at the same time the pin is a thread from the past a mockingjay echo from a fallen tribute reaching into the present sparking hope for the districts rebellion against the capitols cruelty that is why the pin was so important why its really the soul of the story with so much already lost in going from book to movie i just cannot understand why they would cut parts of the actual theatrical movie out of the dvd when it would easily have fit i would give this dvd release negative stars if i could one star is four too many its not worth buying unless the chintzy studio idiots re release it in an extended version that includes the entire theatrical movie on it 
somehow a teen fiction tale about the loss of humanity via a brutal pointless media experience manages to miss its own message and become a trilogy franchise opportunity to be fair the premise has great potential but the writing and direction was lousy over long by a good hours and if it was a star wars movie it was more episode than episode for comparison i then watched the langoliers based on a stephen king story and even with the dodgy computer graphics at the end it managed more pace excitement and tighter writing go watch it instead 
this was a shockingly bad movie let me amend that the sets special effects and performances were all generally superior the script however was practically incoherent it screamed of being by committee with multiple conflicting voices none of whom had a particularly good command of the language in fact muting the sound putting on a great piece of music and just watching this as a visual experience is the way to go otherwise skip it this film is a perfect example of the degree to which every aspect of film making sets fx performances are far outdistancing the s ty scripts being delivered very strange 
special effects is the only good thing i can say about this movie and even then it is only at par with what is coming out today so no big deal these last movies that came out on star trek should have been renamed testosterone trek that is all this is they have taken everything that gene rodenberry wrote and used to originally create star trek and pitched everything out the window there is no original thinking either as they not only pitched everthing out but then resalvaged a few lines and roles but reversed the roles and lines on different characters for example we now have the same scene in wrath of khan where spock saved the ship but died in the process but now the new and improved version of star trek kirk saves the ship and dies in the process and spock fights to bring kirk back to life wow cant get more original than that but stay tuned it will be uhuras turn in the next movie and khan is not east asian with a name like kahn nunien sing but looks like a new york manhattan executive with a british accent and asian eastern in name only i guess his name comes from a mixed up marriage what the hey they not only did not have original ideas but the directors and producers had to really work hard and pull a lot of hair to find ways to twist existing plots and lines around to where the same plots and lines exist but reverse the characters to sum it all up i will not go see the third movie when it comes out i may buy the dvd only if i can find it at the bin at wal marts when i saw this one i kept running to the bathroom thinking i was going to vommit they are so desparate to appeal to the younger generation and reel in the fast buck well if the younger generation is that ignorant of good and original stuff then they can have it according to these last movies none of dudes running the starship ever went through the academy they just all came together at one time jumped on board the ship and started running things yeee haaaahhh 
bennie quincy shaft says the new star trek reboot characters have no heart the characters are shallow they have no soul they are caricatures while the first reboot title star trek had many plot holes the movie was in a way somewhat entertaining bertha zelda and i actually watched the movie twice we both had open minds we may not have liked the portrayals of the classic star trek characters as much as the portrayals by the original cast members but we were tolerant however this nd outing is well pure dreck the convoluted plots and the poor acting and the re dubbed dialog in the center of the movie about minutes worth that could have been done better by senor wences made both of us wince the director and the writers should have been very ashamed of this movie because by attempting to re do a classic star trek movie even to the point of borrowing dialog and contriving different versions of events in star trek ii the wrath of khan they ruined not only this movie but also the movie they parodied they truly screwed up bertha zelda commented this is the best part of the movie when the final credits and theme music were being played i thought leonard nimoys appearance to be the best part of the movie finally here was a real actor a believable actor who wasnt just there for the pay cheque the blu ray picture and the high quality sound were wonderful unfortunately the movie itself was one giant step backwards for cinema 
what a disappointment this movie fails on so many levels story special effects overall satisfaction after the first few minutes i turned on my computer and just listened to the movie in the background it was that bad you be the judge 
special effects were top notch but the story blows spock is an emotional cripple kirk is a wussy uhura is a nagging girl friend sulu is still nothing chekov is a dope and scotty is relegated to little more than comic relief the only real positive was bones because urban is the only one to actually try to emulate his predecessor skip this one unless you are a brain dead abrams fan real star trek fans see this crap for what it is pure crap 
every fan of the original series knows that kahn was not a skinny blue eyed caucasian the actor who played kahn did a good job but its impossible to forget ricardo montalban the new kahn is so thin and frail looking he cannot physically convince the audience that hes capable of single handedly killing a few dozen klingons and surviving a space ship crash he lacks the physique needed for the physicality of this role i actually give the movie stars its the kahn casting that frustrates this fan so much 
by ripped off i mean that they completed ripped off the original khan episode almost word for word this passes for creativity i sat in the theater for what seemed like forever shaking my head at the stupidness of this movie on so many levels what a disappointment 
i hated the first abrams movie because by destroying the planet vulcan he completely destroyed the timeline of the original series i was hoping that in star trek into darkness he would correct the mistake but he did not moreover in this ghastly sequel he changed the story lines involving commander pike and khan i absolutely hated this movie 
in an effort to both be its own film and retain the spirit of the original star trek this reminds me of the old proverb chase two rabbits and youll lose both couldnt be any truer here the real problem here is a gross lack of story the more you think about it the more you realize not a lot happened during the film if anything was going to happen they rushed through it as fast as humanly possible to get to more cg action none of the characters are really developed at all from the last film and while khan looks cool and benedict tries really hard to give him character the writing just gives zero room for it we get the briefest glimpse into who he is and sort of what hes trying to do but through and through the film cant figure out what it wants to be we dont really focus on anything in particular we get a hodgepodge of characters but they dont develop they just act khan ends up as nothing more than a cartoon character virtually no exposition no background and not even so much as a hint of what the hell project genesis was all about benedict gets no opportunity to develop his character or his relationship to his crew what made the original so great is just well not there they just dont follow that now that would be perfectly fine if what they did follow was interesting but it doesnt bother with that theres so much nothing going on it just doesnt ever amount to anything substantial it truly feels like half a film and they certainly dont even bother to hide that theyre loading up for another sequel but it feels like half a film because we get the action part of things but none of the why should we care part of things which is kind of critical kirk is kirk spock is spock everyones everyone from the first film but theres no real development theres a tiny bit with kirk but just not enough and the switcheroo they pull for the twist feels horribly forced and also a bit saccharine killing off whatever chance for drama there could have been its really sad that nothing works here which is simply because too little happens in such a long timespan we get the klingons literally for about five minutes and they look ridiculous bright blue eyes the hell we sort of get khan once while hes talking to kirk at one point for less than five minutes and the rest is nothing more than nonstop action look action is fine in any film but youve got to give me a reason to care about whats going on the whole film felt like it was leading up to something interesting but it never does it ends so abruptly and without much really occurring with an ending that is literally nothing more than setting up the next film that it cant accomplish anything very very disappointing feels like one of those films that had enough executive meddling and arguing to the point that everyone conceded and got a little of what they wanted but nothing added up at the end if all you want is action with no drama or character to speak of well go for it but if you sort of like to care the slightest bit about its characters god help you if you saw wrath of khan already because this whole film cant even get that one single character to be anything worth following forget it an extremely poor star trek film new or not the original abrams flick was far superior in every possible department and it doesnt do a thing for khans character or the original film just another generic action flick without anything substantial guiding it 
forgive them gene roddenberry they know not what they do or did while this flick might provide for a satisfactory pubescent blow em up while you pop your zits type of video game experience but as an old school sci fi kind of trekkie my expectations were to be captivated by inspiring intelligent dialogue thought provoking thrilling plot the timeless monumentality of gene roddenberrys characters kirk spock co in this version of star trek plot dialogue have been replaced by incessant blinding explosions flashy artificial space goober visual effects staccato repetitive weapon blasts in a melee of mindless testosterone inspired battles the blah bland bromidic clich eacute d cornball cornfed corny dull as dishwater lack luster unconvincing performances of the actors was just uncomfortable unfulfilling to watch in summery this entire production could be described as a cringe worthy dumbed down caricature of the real deal sad someone here had written that the director of this movie j j abrams should be taken out back shot grins i dont agree i think it should be a slow death that hurts a whole lot as a memorable life lessonto never no matter how much personal financial gain can be realized take somethingof brilliance wit originality excellence turn it into drek into darkness 
benedict cumberbatch did a great job with bad lines and a horrid attempt to rein vision a classic villain who s only similarity to the original was that he woke up the rest is a light show if i wanted to see lights and pretty youths moving around quickly i d take drugs at a rave if you leave a star trek movie saying that was awesome dude then it probably wasnt a good star trek movie if you leave a star trek movie with a lifted heart and a feeling a hope for the human race and then engage in an intellectual dialogue about the moral and ethical conflicts and the theories posed in the film then walla theres dino transformers and die hard theres enough seizer inducing effects driven paper thin characters with perfect bone structures pooping one liners in place of plots let star trek remain intelligent social commentary i can see jj and the hollywood suits looking at star trek source material and putting this movie together in a day suit what do we do with kahn he s an icon jj put him in a trench coat suit what do we do with the enterprise in this one jj uh crash it into a building suit star trek is in space jj jj whatever i ll find a way suit what do we do with the whole spock repressing his emotions jj we won t and give him a girlfriend suit if we are pulling scenes from the wrath of kahn how do we make that famous death scene better jj we ll make the other guy die and bring him back in minutes i don t want the audience to have a lingering emotional state or anything suit wow you re a genius mr abrams do you want to direct the next star wars jj hell yeah let s get started as fast as possible i would tell mr jj to leave star trek alone but he already has departing with glee from a universe he admittedly didnt like or understand to add lens flare to a light saber 
really the title of my review says it all the script wreaks of laziness like someone said lets just rewrite star trek wrath of kahn and just change things for this alternate universe weve created even if the script had been good i would have been disappointed when theres a new trek film i cant wait to see what incredible science fiction awaits in this infinite universe of possible stories and what do we get kaaaaaaaaaaaahn 
this movie was very lacking in action and script and it has plot holes the city of new york could go through some scenes that happen in the movie that are supposedly important scenes are never referred to again like khan blows up this building to supposedly kill this family at the beginning of the movie and why he does this is never explained and i found the action scenes what few there were to be very poorly done and to fast paced this movie needed a better director and better script writer 
spoiler alert i own all the star trek motion pictures on blu ray both the kirk and picard versions and have watched all of the others that are readily available on dvd or netflix streaming im not trekie enough to dress up or attend conventions but i enjoy and admire the series especially the historical continuity all the series tried hard to maintain j j abrams has done some very fine film work but his two cgi infested rapes of the star trek saga will never be find a place on my shelf had i never watched a moment of the rodenberry and rodenberry inspired star trek saga i would grant both films at best three stars and describe them as grossly over cgied and aimed at an audience without much of an attention span in other words par for the hollywood course but i have seen rodenberrys work and those he inspired even when he was bound and gagged by minuscule budget constraints everything on the original series he did it so much better and with brain fully engaged both of abrams alternative versions destroy the history the various star trek series carefully constructed and maintained throughout a variety of series the destruction of vulcan in the first film retained here the out of character love interest between spock and uhura the death of christopher pike that negates the original pilot later woven into a two part story in the original series an enterprise bridge that looks nothing like the original the frenetic behavior of every character except spock that is nothing like the original characterizations and this film ends where the tv series began carol marcuss english accent in this film even though she was a an all american girl in star trek ii the wrath of kahn and speaking of kahn into darkness is in part a mirror image recycle of star trek iis conclusion really uncreative j j i saw it coming a mile away benedict cumberbatch is a fine actor and suitably maniacal as kahn but he makes a better sherlock holmes where he can display a range of emotion here he is as expressionless as a statue no doubt at abrams direction ricardo montelban brought so much more flair to the character twice and i here enter a plea to all film makers to stop asking the human body to survive unscathed the physically impossible you dont need science fiction for that watch any james bond film at the end of the film i hoped mightily the enterprise would burn up in earths atmosphere take all its hyperactive characters with it and end this series so gene rodenberry could rest peacefully in his grave i doubt ill get my wish but i wont waste time watching the inevitable third installment 
j j abrams has pretty much managed to ruin the entire star trek universe with this release the characters are flat the actor doing khan is terrible and horribly over acts every scene there is a lot of completely mindless action that really does nothing for the show the fifteen minutes spent flying through space swerving around debris to get kirk and khan to the enemy ship is just stupid but worse than that there are changes to the entire idea of star trek and how it was supposed to be about a better humanity that abrams has essentially destroyed the future suddenly looks and feels bleak and what was the thinking behind changes to the klingons they look fake and just ridiculous then we have plot lines which abrams stole from the pages of star trek ii how we got there chronologically when the events of early khan encounter havent happened seems a stretch but trying to steal the emotional charge of the spock dying scene just seemed contrived and had no impact whatsoever as a star trek fan im appalled at this latest feature it destroys the last vestiges of a noble star trek as a move goer this is just a plain stupid flat and boring and long movie avoid like the plague 
if your gonna have a star trek with kirk and spock they have to be kirk and spock i couldnt get through the first minutes of this and had to shut it off terrible 
nothing new here boringsame old storyline just new actors not as goodlong boring expected outcome in this onedo not waste your time
so sad to see a franchise get even dumber than star trek but this one managed to make that look almost intellectual campfire scene and all what does god need with roberto orci 
star trek into darkness is an insult to trekkies the dialogue is insipid the plot is predictable except when it is making no sense at all drivel squared 
i dont get all the great reviews even from real star trek fans i dont get the movie it was a remake of wrath of khan with a different twist basically i found myself literally smacking my hand to my forehead and going what the special effects were good fine thats what you expect from most action movies these days and yes im not a fan of a re do of the beloved original crew even though i think the selection for the guy who plays mccoy is pretty good i hate the uhura spock relationship it never happened in canon works and its just silly basically the new stuff is someones idea of a remake of star trek just make a new movie series with new characters why are you screwing with a classic movie and sci fi series because you cant think of anything new to do i only have watched these new star treks for free through trial offers i wont pay for them on my own and i feel honestly after voyager the franchise was done for me i hated enterprise and the two new movies just dont fit the new creators wouldnt listen to what fans want and instead tried to re create the series for a younger audience maybe theyre making money but eventually the fanbase wont be there and it will fizzle out this is just another action based sci fi movie series and nothing really special about it im embarrassed it carries the star trek name on it 
i expected much more from a star trek movie if it wasnt a star trek story it would be laughable because of knowing the other plots you become interested in how they mend together with this one but it could have been done in minutes 
like so many of these sci fi sequels theres not enough real story to support the film so a plot is contrived based on original tv series with computer generated visuals designed to take your mind off how little sense this whole production makes tries to ride the khan coat tails way to far and totally contradicts the original tv series story about khan i love star trek stuff but this is just a bad production please no more 
i really dont think that a starship case scene is anything worth watching not funny not engaging not worth the money for the electrons please do not waste yours and perpetuate these hollywood cartoons 
this is a hot steaming pile of drivel is this what passes for social commentary and visionary thinking these days hey if you want explosions noise chaos and inane plots this is the story for you why are they turning star trek into just another bang and crash franchise what now start trek is just another formula series if you want mind numbing drivel go watch transformers fantastic four or the soon to be disd destruction of the star wars franchise etc etc star trek was a great set of series and movies for a time its time has regrettably passed let it die a peaceful death with what little grace it retains i strongly encourage you to avoid this film and any future incarnations at all costs if youre stupid enough to pay for this hot garbage youll only encourage them to continue the stupidity as for the director of this train wreck does this individual know how to do anything else 
if you loved star trek how kirk is a good person how the colors in the future are bright or how spock is a disciplined mind or the beautiful image of a hopeful future then this movie is not for you the true fan can very easily see that this movie was not made by a trekkie but by someone who disliked the whole roddenberry vision the makers of this film thought that their meaningless regurgitation of generic hollywood plot and dialogue was better than the sensitive and inspiring world of a true science fiction writer the plot makes no sense no continuity editing whatsoever kirks eyes are fake contact blue in some scenes just to be brownish in the next in this movie they no longer show kirk as an intelligent captain who refers to shakespeare and thinks deeply upon interpersonal meanings this movie represents kirk as an alcoholic man slut who sleeps with two women at a time and listens to club rap music i guess the whole kirk being a likable person is not as profitable as just showing the kids the new horrible role model that sells units in hollywood today who cares that theyre ruining yet another positive image this is not kirk they missed the point of all the characters weve been developing for fifty years would anybody but a soulless hollywood businessman imagine scotty hanging out at the bar they show him in scotty is a likable old nerd who likes scotch and the hum of his engines not hanging out in a thumping club for fashionable young people no fan ever would have imagined this really stupid scene furthermore in all the rest of star trek whenever they show the earth it is a calm and natural environment we used to get the feeling that the future was something positive and better than today this film shows a dark depressing orwellian future an all gray world of clubs meaningless sex and more bad music the future of earth in this vision is just a dark continuation of todays lowbrow shallow society it is apparent that the makers of this film are either ignorant of roddenberrys positive vision or that they are directly attacking it on purpose they blatantly ignored the point of looking up towards a brighter future and instead made an allegory of todays stupid warlike culture here in a america interestingly the costumes are low quality and by the end they are all literally lined up in what can only be described as nazi uniforms oh they took the time to remove the wwii symbols but thats about it nazi uniforms hat and all also theres the whole tribble problem im not going to get into it too deeply but let it be said that they include the tribble so we can do scientific testing on it great right no what they are really doing here is telling all actual fans that they have not watched and do not care about the previous fifty years of trek mythos question how can you have these creatures before your year mission answer because we dont care about making sense there are many more stupid examples of plot points that make no sense long story short this is not star trek it just looks like it occasionally and they use the say names if you love trek skip this youll be glad you did worst movie yet maybe we need to admit its better to let something end with the passing of the originators than it is to just hand it off to next shallower generation of careless hollywood businessmen 
 cut them up and sew them together haphazardly youd have this movie also it didnt stream properly so i had time to wait and think about what i was watching thats death to a movie like this where you need to check your brain at the door sometimes if something doesnt stream well its worth purchasing this one isnt 
i am not a trekkie but i like the adventure that said this is not star trek it has none of the passion none of the personality and none of the humor i would suggest seeing the honest trailer on youtube for this and save your time 
five stars for the movie however the dvd release is a slap in the face of all paramounts devoted star trek fans a real rip off i just cancelled my month old amazon com pre order for star trek into darkness blu ray d blu ray dvd digital copy on because it hadnt been shipped yet and was scheduled to arrive at least a week after the release and moreso that paramount is screwing us all over by releasing over half of the special features as retailer exclusives half by target half by best buy and the commentary by j j abrams can only be had via a special itunes download played separately from the full priced movie you have to buy in order to get all the exclusives youd need to spend well over for each version so ive decided not to buy any of these stripped versions and wait for the platinum release if that ever happens 
the movie was way too rushed and had all sorts of continuity reality breakdowns there are so many holes and unrealistic action reactions by the characters that it could be used as a colander ill never get those hrs back 
despite the title of the movie and the names of the characters this is not a star trek movie for all his talent as a writer and director jj abrams shows no understanding of or respect for the star trek canon he has devolved the franchise into a mindless over the top action series that holds none of the charm or character of anything done by roddenberry or his immediate successors gene is turning over in his grave at what abrams has done here i only hope lucas can avoid the same fate 
half of the reviews are stars come on terrible plot terrible script mediocre acting i have not seen a movie this bad since the last film worthless 
this abomination of st continues where the initial reboot left off creating a mere caricature of once was star trek the result is a mindless soulless and utterly pointless exercise in blockbuster stupidity the plot is so idiotic it defies description i cant and wont specify this any further or i am gonna have an aneurysm one of the authors mentioned the great amount of social commentary stid was employing i could find none not trying to be a nitpicker i could not escape noticing the giant plot holes and purposeful violations of star trek laws i felt like i was watching a slapstick action comedy aimed at an audience of idiots this is not what star trek is or should be i could not find a single aspect of this picture i liked jj abrams said himself that the fans were not only not his focus group but that he even tried to make a movie not for fans but outsiders considering that statement i believe he succeeded completely and considering that very statement can anybody please for the love of god explain to me why if he they tried so hard to make something not for the fans they still felt compelled to include khan eugenics tribbles and basically ever other major plot line from star trek the warth of khan into this picture what am i expected to think about people that tell me that what i love is so lame it needs to be reinvented completely and then serve me a complete rehash even down to identical dialogue lines as a result the only reason for that is that i as a fan are considered as being stupid but hey far from me to say anything against a movie that garners an rating on imdb all the more evidence that this film is aimed at a completely different target audience furthermore the look of the film is reminiscent of a computer operating system the sound effects were embarassing the pacing was moronic all the actors degraded to puppets of a braindead script and even the films pseudo emotional climax was robbed of its impact by a clear setup resolve scene early in the movie that serves no other logical purpose to reverse plot elements that occur later screenwriting for complete jerks as someone who has been watching st for years now i honestly feel like it may be best for me to just keep buying the great blu ray releases of the st television series all of them and stop right there i even bought this movie in used condition because i couldnt bring myself to support what is being done to something i love so much i dare anyone to honestly tell me that this crap is superior to what was done in st both in tv and cinema before the reboot idea occured i loathe these last two films and can only wish that this does not keep going on star trek is such a great phenomenon and it sure as hell does not deserve this incredibly idiotic treatment any longer please make it stop one thing though i am really sure of st the wrath of khan is years old as of the writing of this review i will be there in and will laugh my ass off when nobody talks about this piece of cinema bs anymore let alone remakes it in the long run true quality reveals itself just like the lack of any will also 
the creators of this movie took everything that was wonderful about the previous movie and threw it away mccoy never has anything to say that any other character could not say for him might as well have put him in a red suit spock is dumb the girls and yes all the women characters are just girls are freaking annoying all the care that went into making the relationships that fueled the sci fi believability in the first movie is missing here i watched it once and thought it was okay i watched it again and realized that it michael bay sucked if you want to compare with other movies i loved the first bourne movie was okay with the second and fell asleep in the third as it failed in exactly the same way as this sequel did of course i loved the bad guy but thirty seconds of cool bad guy glares only gets you through a couple of handfuls of popcorn i super sized for naught 
my husband is a big star trek fan and this movie was not so great compared to all the other star trek movies i would not purchase this movie rent it instead or stream it not worth purchasing physical dvd 
how could the producers possibly believe we are this stupid they start by lowering spock by cable into a volcano by cable it gets worse much worse the characters are insulting caricatures any star trek fan should be irate desperatly irate at this abomination if i could give it minus stars i would 
terrible plot high school acting poor attempt at duplicating the original 
it appears that with digital technology the plot gets lost in special effects motion and running around this is nothing more than high tech war games packaged with star trek characters 
star trek go like this save planet yeah we all that great cgi enterprise goes underwater got big fish swimming around scotty always funny dramatic music during boring parts more cgi kirk is party guy go banging two hot aliens with tails then get in trouble from the principal for saving the planet the federation dress up like nazis now kirk too cool for feds kirk wear leather jacket great cgi sad couple with dying girl ominous dude show up to save little girl big explosion kirk fired from his job he is great man for some unkown reason 
i have been trying not to watch this but couldnt hold off any more i didnt really like the other abrams movie either i dont understand the reason for taking a genre with years worth of history and throwing of it out into darkness is basically a remake of wrath of kahn sort of i mean it has most of the right characters and even some of the plot what it lacks is a good dramatic story good actors and good execution abrams star trek movies are filled with lots of action and lots of good effects but the way i see it those are the candy coating on a light sour filled interior while i would never call shatner a good actor in comparison to those in the abrams film he could be an academy award winner you could tell there were sections where one actor or another botched their lines and this is what got past the editing room floor in the end this was just the blasphemy of a classic piece of science fiction so if you like ds or older shows or the non abrams movies skip this 
no true self respecting fan of star trek would appreciate these rehashed mutilated versions warped by a hopped up deranged director such as abrams it is clear that the executives are finally showing their true faces the hate they have carried against star trek but dared not to show until majel was gone for fear they would be denounced for what they are lose control of the franchise the only reason anyone tolerates it is because there is no other alternative star trek available and no one with enough power to boot them out of the franchise the roddenberrys are likely spinning in their graves over these reboot films in addition to the mutilation of past storylines because they obviously cant think of anything original they show their hate of the franchise by destroying things held most dear such as vulcan the original crew just to get back at the roddenberrys original fans no one who truly cares about a franchise would ever cater to those who wish to destroy the canon slap the core fans in the face unless it was an ultimate act of animosity while holding the original fans hostage to their defecation on a beloved institution if anyone would bother to rewatch the original series they would see kirk was a soft spoken warm gentle character a romantic with intense loyalty willing to take risks to save his ship he was never the wild out of control cowboy he has been portrayed nor was spock ever adversarial or harmful to kirk nor would scotty ever defy kirk in such a manner nor mccoy such a scatterbrain sure fans would love to see more new original episodes of tos their younger years but not destroying every character storyline as has been done much worse leaving it in the hands of some hopped up flashlight obsessed warped minded microphone addicted lunatic like abrams they are clearly out of touch someone needs to repair the damage 
 spock were talking about your life if i didnt know chris pines work better bottle shock id think he totally sucks what a waste 
being an original trekkie i found this movie so tedious the characters were over the top poor copies of the originals they went overboard with spocks logic overboard with kirks distaste for rules and authority bones was just ridiculous just a very bad copy of all that is star trek i will say that the actor who portrayed spock did a fine job and visually he was spock 
just plain bad bones was the only character who was faithful to the character and cast well other than that this movie stunk to high heaven way too over the top predictable and tedious despite all the shiny things explosions and gee whiz special effects dont even get me started on khan is this supposed to be a comic book thing now if so make sure to include a superhero to go along with the supervillain i should have known better when i saw the name j j abrams associated with this movie i couldnt even finish watching it was just that bad will i go to bed tonight wondering if james t kirk prevailed in the end gee i wonder 
i grew up on tos star trek the original cast movies were hit and miss stick with the even numbered original cast movies but at least they were original right from the get go this flick gives itself away the plot is a series of invented events that make little sense to get the cast to a point in the story where they need to be for the next retarded series of events then there is the cast the actor chosen to play the part of kahn carried the role with all the presence of a house cat pretending to be a lion i realize the original kahn played by the late great ricardo montalban would be a hard act to follow but seriously a skinny brit it was sad to watch and let us add up the unbelievably stupid aspects of this movie that the supposed alternate time line allowed klingons that look like cat people with too many body piercings a transporter that can send a person not just from earth to the moon but over a hundred light years away all the way to the flaming klingon home world who needs a starship when you have a super transporter on steroids what did jj abrams do to come up with that one one too many beers yah well say beers lets not forget the warp drive trip back to earth alllll the way back from the klingon home world the script needed it to happen in minutes and not days sooooo lets do it again folks oh yah now it was kirks turn to die saving the ship and not spocks as in star trek youre so original jj oh yes and let us not forget the part where a warp driven starship is hanging out under water on some goofy planet a dozen ways the enterprise could have stayed outta sight from the primitive native inhabitants while they complete their planet saving mission but we needed a scene where the giant starship comes out of the sea cause its like way kool doesnt make any sense having kirk violate the prime directive for no reason except to make the scene happen but its like totally kool looking so why not throw it in the mix sigh imo people that gave this movie or stars would have given it or stars even if it had talking tribbles take over the enterprise seriously can jj abrams get any more contrived in his scripts i know he wants to just make money using the star trek name but this movie is just sad embarrassing why dont you throw in a few purple dinosaurs next time for the kiddies there jj 
awful script simple high school type characters the nerd the jock corny dialogue terrible acting a made for tv type film that has been done again and again the target audience is adolescent boys age if you are the target you might like it grown ups should avoid this waste of time 
gene roddenbury had his ashes launched into space recently i think it was to get away from this piece of crap not only does j j abrams rewrite the history of the original star trek series he has the gaul to think we wont notice im no trekkie ive never been to a convention nor have i ever dressed up as a star trek character but i am a fan of the series s and i have to tell you that i was insulted and appalled at what they allowed this hack of a writer and sorry excuse of a director to perpetrate onto the masses this is crap please dont buy it please dont rent it please dont do antything that might encourage these morons to continue to destroy the greatest sci fi fanchise in history any further 
the acting is just fair the guy who plays scotty has real problems with the dialect to the point that it is distracting the action in the first minutes of the movie belies the lack of action to come worse than anything the premise is very very weak dont pay too much to see this just wait till you can watch it for a dollar and that would be fair 
 this review may contain spoilers star trek is one of the only television successes to contain some actual science fiction concepts especially from rd season forward in next generation but this movie like its crappy reboot predecessor is an action movie with spaceships into darkness has about as much science fiction and boldly going as the recent james bond skyfall which is to say sadly none this terrible writing team has contrived a tapestry of action with artificial amped up crisis after crisis the entire movie is essentially action scenes with a couple of pauses for clich eacute d dramatic beats youre a loose cannon this time its personal vulcans should be more emotional most of the cast is terrible cartoon caricature scotty bones are abysmal saturday night live sketch performances except greenwood as pike this actor is directorproof great in exotica and kirk and spock are good enough to keep me interested at a very low level the things lifted from wrath of khan are numerous and embarrassing and exemplify everything that is wrong with hollywood and the remake reboot machine no creativity anywhere too much attempt to please the crowd without any thought challenge or boldly going anywhere looks like jj abrams is well set up to continue making star wars movies exactly as cluttered and contrived and silly as the phantom menace cluttered action sequences thievery aka homages caricatures into darknessits sad that an innovative franchise is now a dumb loud and thoughtless lowest common denominator junk sci fi should make you think but this pile of noise shuts down the thinking process 
this is simply a trek movie to appeal to the masses a bunch of people who arent even trek fans making an action movie now the same guy is doing a star wars reboot that i also will have nothing to do with 
there is little to like about this latest star trek movie and im a life long fan spoiler alertthis film is so unoriginal it copies the exact scene in wrath of khan where spock dies only reverses the positions of spock and kirk its kirk who dies saving the ship from a warp core breach brought on by khan it even has spock screaming khan like kirk did in star trek ii then kirk is magically brought back to life by khans healing blood im rolling my eyes right now the casting is bad khan was originally played twice by ricardo montalban and he did a great job he had a spanish accent and a very well developed body montalban was believable as a genetically enhanced man the actor playing khan in this film benedict cumberbatch has neither when youre watching the film and you first learn cumberbatch is khan youre left thinking huh this skinny guy he isnt believable couldnt they have found a hispanic actor with a six pack to play khan they threw in hottie actress alice eve to play kirks old flame carol marcus the mother of his love child david sadly alice has no real role she is simply eye candy the writers could have explored the relationship she develops with kirk since weve never seen any of that but no instead we just see her in underwear then theres kirk who keeps flouting the rules acting illogically and irresponsibly but does so because hes so noble so heroic hes always risking his life for others he cares so much he should have been a nurse instead of a starship captain it isnt believable someone would get away with so much bad behavior from their employer starfleet or have such luck they need to stop making star trek movies they are out of ideas note to producers please dont put a vampire on the enterprise in the next lame installment 
if you like space battles nifty new design concepts of ships and you felt that the nearly fifteen minutes in star trek the motion picture still wasnt enough time to fully visually caress the exterior of the u s s enterprise then youll love star trek into the darkness to be fair the actors give fantastic performances chris pine as kirk zachary quinto as spock and the other actors who reprise their roles of the enterprise crew have absolutely grown in their roles and as before are a joy to watch for viewers remotely familiar with star treks television canon there are deep mischaracterizations of the villain khan these mischaracterizations are aside from altering his initial ethnicity in the space seed khan noonian singh appears of indian extraction in the film he is british in the tv episode the space seed script and ricardo montalbans performance crafted the year old frozen superman as a suave commanding charismatic leader who was as much a ladies man as he was a tactician and intellect in contrast orci and kurtzmans script has dumbed down khan to the level of a vindictive reactive wounded wolf who leaps before he looks in attempting to manipulate kirk and the crew of the enterprise into serving his goals of rescuing his fellow frozen supermen the film also does not pay full homage to roddenberrys depiction of a rd century united federation of planets that is pushing out colonies into the far reaches of the galaxy the script isolates almost all of the terrorist and political damage on earth the initial terrorist incursion is in a visually stylistic london the star fleet council that is convened to consider the events is also on earth and the threat from khan seems primarily aimed at earth other than the klingons we have little sense of the rest of human colonization those who may be aware of abrams orcis and kurtzmans preference for star wars will also note that as in the earlier film there is obvious star wars homage the situation is that the enterprise crew needs a stealth way into a klingon stronghold without identifying themselves as federation so kirk orders that the ship from their recent mudd incident be manned by kirk spock and uhura in an attempt to get past the kiingon defences the shape of mudds freighter has an odd commonality with a miniature plain surface version of the millenium falcon the bantering that goes on amid the characters while different in content is reminiscent of the camaraderie of skywalker leia and solo the external shots of the ships evasion of mountains and pursuing klingon vessels involves side swipes that seem to pull directly from the cinematography of the millennium falcon in its desperate efforts to escape the empires pursuit in star wars for mindless action entertainment and adequate blue screen cinematography you can get away with spending a couple hours watching this film but dont expect much of a take away other han a few smiles for enjoyable nostalgic character enactments by some truly gifted actors 
this was a compete disappointment and is so incredibly trite cheesy and stale that i will not even bother to spend the time itemizing the number of times watching it invoked my gag reflex the storyline photography lighting music were embarrassingly crappy and derivative and i found myself feeling sorry for the actors who were given this crappy production and expected to create something believable out of it i own every other motion picture release in the star trek genre but this one i will be dropping off at the local goodwill store 
once again the studios are trying to screw over the fan what else is new much like the new line lotr theatrical release discs this first trek release has almost zero special features that obviously means they plan a second edition in the near future with better features etc etc etc i pre ordered this blu ray expecting it to be similar to the first release it is not ill wait and spend my money on the special edition 
this was a tired cliche riddled rehash it was so bad they lifted whole pages of script from the original i cant think of the guy who plays khan but he was a poor casting choice i t is hard to fill ricardo montiban shoes but in a modern remake how did a northern european get cast as a sub continent evil genus i loved the first reboot this one not so much
this is without a doubt the worst trek movie ever released it was written directed and produced by a bunch of clods that probably never had an original thought in their lives this current version of trek movies is supposed to predate the original series tos but we have kahn tribbles radiation accidents and a myriad of other things introduced in tos and tng series did these idiots have a hand in remaking the battlestar galactia series that changed starbuck into a female or the ironside series that arbitrarily transformed chief ironside into a black man i really wish that the powers to be in hollywood would have the sack to prevent this kind of crap from being released in the future may the people that made this film live short and go broke 
its a shame that with all of the subject matter available from the original series that this subject was picked as one that would matter too many characterizations and not enough character the fun of a good movie is not to watch them blow up set after set after set after set 
this is a very irritating movie on so many levels the ambience of the effects is like a bad star wars movie the story is a corrupted rehash of several previous star trek sub plots the character development is just awful with everybody being in a bad mood most of the time and kirk is brought back from the dead lazarus like by vastly obtuse deus ex machina conceit they have completely run out of ideas at paramount for this franchise and this movie is like a farerwell requiem but maybe the younger people have an insatiable appetite for star trek that looks like star wars that looks like hulk that looks like batman but not for me
i see all these glowing reviews and i sit here wondering if there are really that many paid reviewers out there or if theres just that many folks who want to justify having spent the money to see this so called film to put it simply it was the single worst star trek film paramount has ever made and that is including v and the insurrection debacle so thats saying a lot i grew up a trek fan but i have always been pretty forgiving toward the movies because guess what folks make mistakes but this one is so utterly atrocious that it is mind numbing to even think it actually got released to the public gene roddenberry is rolling in his grave i could go on a huge rant about all the major screw ups bad writing bad cinematography bad acting bad directing bad cgi bad set design enormous plot holes and there are so friggin many but others have already torn it to pieces and frankly im sick of explaining the asinine qualities of the film at length j j abrams is simply put one of the worst directors in modern cinema i enjoyed the first reboot film as i felt the actors had a pretty good grasp of the characters and they did admirable performances in spite of the enormous plot holes and inconsistencies in the film its still one of the ones i like to watch but the success of that film and the subsequent sequel arent thanks to any level of quality but rather on the extreme sentimentality many trekkies have for the original series these films bank on that and pull in others with the modern half assed style of movies that lacks any of the charm or wit that drem real trekkies to the classics and the shows its a mass market movie made for everyone and trekkies who simply cant get enough of the old stuff all the while filled with the single most asinine plot i have ever seen in a film if you want a perfect summation of just why this film is retarded go watch how it should have ended hishe on youtube and they will show you the simplest explanation of how stupid this film really is absolutely avoid at all costs go watch star trek ii and have fun if you need a khan fix 
first of all the purpose of the first movies reboot was to open up new possibilities second the original kahn was a freaking genius not just a throwaway monster thirdly the war hungry admiral plot couldve worked as its own movie without stomping the memory of kahn into mud the kirk violates the rules and gets rewarded schtick is old and were only two movies into the new franchise scottys been relegated to a clown below are some notes i jotted down right after watching the movie the opening scene makes so little sense and sets up such an obvious this ll look so cool moment that i immediately felt uncomfortable watching it the brevity of kirk s demotion makes it unnecessary especially in light of the last movie and its juggling of who s really the captain the original kahn learned how to take over a starship while recovering from centuries of cryogenic slumber the guy was physically awesome but his enormous ego and intellect made him a wonderful villain this kahn s brilliance occurred mostly off screen before the opening scene if he d been ricardo montelban brilliant he d have done something cleverer to put the dreadnaught into his hands this kahn was a villain used as a tool of an insider villain not very trek imho the blond i imagined a craftier plot than really existed i thought she was part of kahn s plan like the starfleet officer in the original series advanced photon torpedoes designed and capable of striking the klingon homeworld really oh and kahn went there why again 
maybe e everybody incl the writers got tired of the same old it was boring and i couldve finish watching it
star trek started as a one hour show in the s that presented an idea in each episode some of the acting was goofy and the special effects shaky but it had integrity it imagined a better world and a better humanity fast forward years and we find a plot devoid of any ideas captain kirk and crew uhura excepted seem more out of some teenage sitcom where the adults are foolish and the kids arrogant and self centered into darkness drops us into this mess and we are left with a loud and frequently incoherent film that cobbles together some ideas from previous films and episodes into a movie star trek into darkness ranks below the final frontier and that takes some doing 
everything is so drawn out you keep waiting for the characters to get somewhere but they never do it takes them an hour and a half just to eat dinner and trash bilbos house then they travel nowhere for the next hour and a half get chased by orcs and wind up on the peak of some mountain which appears to still be a mile drive to their ultimate destination the ancient kingdom of the dwarves the eagles should have just taken them to the mountain so we can get the travel channel portion of the movie over with wake up the dragon which should take all of minutes and call it a day i love the lord of the rings but the critics are right this should have been one movie instead of three it could have been a spectacular hour adventure instead it is hours and minutes of my life i will never get back with more to lose 
i hated the movie the humor was cheap and the combat scenes were way too frantic radagast felt like the second coming of jar jar binks hey actually jar jar binks is sophisticated clever and deft in comparison honestly is there anyone simple enough to enjoy this kind of humor the dwarves dont look like dwarves they look like punks with funny hairstyles thorin looks aragornish and dont get me started on the ridiculous goblin king or the cartoonish white orc 
unbelievably warner brothers has decided that the digital copy of this movie unlike the lotr trilogy can only be viewed on flixster through their specific app no itunes copy well that just sucks i tried flixster for a while on my ipad it was horrible movies would load but never process i deleted it out of sheer frustration thanks warner brothers for limiting my options on my digital copy 
the lotr trilogy was amazing and i expected this to be equally good it is horrible far too much time spent on battles and action sequences of different types with virtually none of it advancing the plot did i say plot im being kind the screen play is absolute garbage based on the lousy screen play everything else faltered and sank too bad because the potential was there i tried to accept this as a stand alone story rather than anything related to the hobbit novel but it is a dismal failure it fails as an adaption and it fails as a stand alone it isnt even watchable i had to fast forward through most of it looking for something that might be plot there wasnt much how could jackson have screwed up so badly i wont bother renting the next part i hope another screen writer and director maybe one of the harry potter ones will make an enjoyable version of this classic book i almost hope the tolkien family sues 
i put off watching this movie until recently i could not figure out how a medium length book was going to require three movies well at least half of the movie contained material that was not in the book most of it violent fighting scenes over and over and over again my husband and i found it very tedious i fell asleep in the middle the hobbit was i believe originally meant to be a book for young people and this movie with its gratuitous violence is anything but i will not be watching the next two movies i loved the lord of the rings trilogy but not this movie sorry 
this so called d release was absolutely shameful both in storyline and in technology a brief q a sums it all up question when does it take nearly half of the movie to leave an ad nauseam frat party toga scene held at bilbo baggins pad answer the hobbit an unexpected journey question when does a director suck at d technology in producing a state of the art d movie that does not come close to the quality of other precursor d movies like avatar or the guardians answer the hobbit an unexpected journey question when do you know when the hobbit filmmaking series cinematic epic is over answer when it breaks your heart after watching the hobbit an unexpected journey question when do you know you got pimped and played because you were under the magical spell of previous hobbit movies answer after watching the hobbit an unexpected journey and looking again at the cover image of the disc package which depicts a wide brim cane bopping hobbit land mac daddy wizard pimp yes we got played but at least we know not to purchase the remaining two releases in this current trilogy 
out of all the tolkien books this was my favorite the hobbit was the shortest book of four the lord of the rings movies were excellent but the hobbit is total disappointment it is only a veiled attempt at following the book it left a great deal of the book out and gave us characters that didnt appear in the book i cant imagine what hes going to do with the next two movies my advice for those who havent read the book do and for those who have read it again and for everyone dont waste your money on this film 
id been avoiding the peter jackson movies because i was afraid theyd ruin the books for me i neednt have worried since this bears so little resemblance to tolkien that calling it the the hobbit is just a marketing gimmick yes bilbo is in there somewhere and there are dwarves and theyre on their way to the lonely mountain thats about it a totally gratuitous hollywood super villain revenge subplot gets tacked on radagast stars as a sort of ewok clown the sequence of events is reinvented there are booger jokes and more basically every obligatory predictable hollywood childrens fantasy movie trope has been layered on so much so thankfully that the movie is often unintentionally funny and otherwise pretty much forgettable maybe on a big screen the scenery would be cool im stretching here the one part of the hobbit thats done well is the riddle scene this scene really does convey tension authenticity and gollums grief at the loss of his precious 
repetitive tiring obvious bloated with filler and what is really odd even the action seems dull this one is for die hard fans of the hobbit only 
this movie is so long and so redundant already there will be three more this makes the lord of the rings trilogy seem brief 
obviously im in the minority here i really had intentions of enjoying this movie but that just didnt happen the scenes seem to be way longer than necessary and the story line just seemed to drag on and on and on zzzzzzz im sure much of this could have been shortened to a more tolerable level after all how long is a childs attention span certainly not what i expected after seeing so many good reviews for this epic movie to me this seemed to be an effort on rewriting the book and then failing in the attempt after an hour of wasted time i just couldnt take it any more and tapped 
now ill admit off the bat that i have read the hobbit quite a few times since i was a child and had it read to me quite a few times before i could read so yes i love the book for anyone with a similar background i can confidently say youre best served not watching the film simple as that read no further that said i probably differ from a lot of the people who loved the book in that i didnt expect a perfect word for word re enactment of the book i figured it would be have to be different from a logistical standpoint how do you cram a whole book or even a third of a book into a relatively short time for the sake of the movie i found myself not offended by this movie as a lover of the book but just laughing a lot i estimate at least of the events in the film dont happen in the book another is composed of cgi action extrapolated off events that kinda sorta did happen in the book but not really the remaining was kind of pleasant i guess they got the appearance of some things right a few times they had characters say some of the actual lines from the book although much less frequently than youd think but it was very strange practically every major event in the book is altered away from what it was and a lot of little things got altered during the cleaning of the dishes they omitted so carefully carefully with the plates in favor of repeating an earlier part of the song they didnt save any time with the omission and lost some of the meaning of what was going on or when they finally got around to the opening couple sentences from the book they changed them it was a hobbit hole and that means comfort able things and for instance they made the dwarves oafish rude and kind of dumb instead of the exceedingly polite educated highborn fellows they were which made it more difficult to understand why bilbo had a hard time turning them away so instead of getting to know the dwarves a little bit and perhaps liking them sympathizing with them they remain relatively generic and un likeable which is why later they have to develop the new subplot of bilbos pity for them oh i have a home and you dont in place of what worked in the book because otherwise bilbos actions dont make sense at all the additions rather than streamlining the book into a film created more work the authors had to backtrack later to try and repair does bilbos sympathy for the dwarves in the last minutes of the film make up for them being made into such unsympathetic characters at the beginning the writers end up creating problems that take even longer to solve than it would have to just do the original thing this really is a case of short cuts make for long delays and of course theres all the extra mind numbing action with all the action cliches people yelling nooooooo in slow mo happens over and over so much happens so quickly in such an undulating cgi consequence free unreality that it takes you out of the story and straight out of the movie so you end up with this film that is bloated with alterations additions and cgi action youd figure the additions at least the action was there to keep it exciting but the overall effect is surprisingly boring id heard there was a lot of extra stuff in the movie and was prepared to give it a chance but wow just wow my point isnt so much hey they diverged from the book but my god they went to a lot of trouble to diverge from the book with a bunch of rd rate material when using the original stuff would have been easier then dragged in unnecessary stuff from the lotr to do a number on that too then added a whole bunch of extra new stuff that was even worse its amazing that in deciding to alter so much for the sake of making it into a movie we end up with a hour movie where the majority of the movie wasnt part of the book or the appendices its as if they wanted to make idunno krull with rabbit sleighs but get everyone to buy it by referencing the hobbit only to blunder every reference and fail with their new material i honestly dont feel that my childhood story was ruined any way this is so far from the original i dont recognize it just embarrassed for the makers of this film standing on its own as a film unconnected with any book its a confused boring cliched mess guillermo del toro im embarrassed for more than anyone although he showed the good sense to leave the project so maybe hopefully hes the least to blame hes never produced a lame boring cliche ridden turkey like this before so ill give him a pass well see in july with pacific rim if hes still got the magic or not so if youre looking for a fantasy movie skip this and do idunno krull ladyhawke legend stardust princess bride willow any of the harry potters the narias werent too bad i hear time bandits i guess you could throw in highlander if you like if you want to go the sword and sorcery route and dont mind on purpose campiness theres beastmaster and the various conan movies 
well not entirely unexpected travesty a false absurd or distorted representation of something director sir peter jacksons prior reworking of a few elements of the lord of the rings reworkings that telegraphically but tellingly indicated jacksons profound miscomprehension of the material he was dealing with were clues that jacksons bona fides as nuncio of jrr tolkiens mythic vision were very very very tenuous at best while i enjoyed the lotr films i dont consider them classics so much as more or less providentially lucky strikes but here we enter a new world a world in which jackson compels his actors and actresses and special effects gurus and everyone connected with this film to become his unwitting instruments for leaving his metaphorical spray all over tolkiens pristine middle earth jackson in effect takes a work of shakespeare and turns it into pee wees big adventure takes a work on the sublime level of mark twain and translates it down to the crass level of adam sandler if you relish that sort of thing the caricaturing and travesty of something resplendently beautiful into something frenetically tacky or are willing to look past it you may enjoy this film jackson is acknowledged as a serious artist and talented director who began his career directing dark comedy slapstick horror twisted spoofs and macabre tales such as the films bad taste meet the feebles braindead and heavenly creatures directing travesties in other words of healthy normal characters and situations one amazon reviewer mark pollock describes meet the feebles thus if you enjoy watching puppets curse vomit defecate urinate fornicate come down with venereal disease do drug deals do drugs and shoot each other up with machine guns then this film is right up your alley it is not a childrens film thats for sure jacksons directorial career has been accoladed with three academy awards and even a knighthood from his homeland of new zealand but a simple understanding of and ability to convey virtue have never ever been strengths of jacksons resume have i been wordy in fine this film is the apotheosis of shlock jacksons meet the hobbits has moral decadence written all over it a mishandling of pure things by jacksons impure hands as joseph pearce author ofbilbos journey discovering the hidden meaning in the hobbit puts it peter jackson does not understand virtue the film makes one reflect not so much upon the mystery of middle earth as upon the mystery of peter jackson the film explores this mystery extensively if you are someone fascinated by peter jackson this film is perhaps the perfect vehicle you will learn a lot certainly much more than you will learn about jrr tolkiens the hobbit jacksons conceptual designer for this film has remarked that for jackson the film is almost incidental really incidental to what seems a valid question incidental to peter jacksons self expression seems a valid answer as another amazon reviewer knight rain puts it the book is filled with mystery and charm the movie is a neurological attack on the mind then there is christopher tolkien jrr tolkiens son who comments thus on peter jacksons work they sir peter jackson and co gutted the book making an action movie for year olds this level of marketing reduces to nothing the aesthetic and philosophical significance of this work and it seems that the hobbit will be the same kind of film and theres the rub for there are those among us who consider jrr tolkiens book the hobbit a very fine work of art indeed we feel stories such as the hobbit are rare very rare and we consider that if handled they should be handled with care because there are very few beautiful things in this world tolkien stated the lord of the rings is a fundamentally religious and catholic work it follows much the same is true of the hobbit you may say so what i will reply the essence of tolkiens middle earth is virtue not travesty soul not soullessness tolkiens world is full of tales of heroism and beauty it is a world of oral tradition and loveliness and mysterious grace for example tolkiens comment in chapter five of the hobbit riddles in the dark that of course the riddle game was sacred and of immense antiquity and even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat when they played it find that spirit in this film you cannot which is why i propose you cannot find tolkien in this film only peter jackson 
this is such a convoluted mess of a movie decent acting and production values aside this is one of least favorite movies of the year it may have worked if it were just the story of the hobbit relatively short simple and very enjoyable instead to make another billion dollars they stretch it into another trilogy with so much filler that it is often hard to remember what the actual story is also i found the added characters to be annoying and an s big waste of time plus they pretty much turned gandalf in to optimus prime for the too frequent and drawn out action scenes it is long and feels very long not recommended for fans of the book or of the lord of the rings movies 
this movie is almost unwatchable it is the worst and has nothing redeeming about it if you liked lord of the rings you will hate this 
gosh i cant say that ive ever gone into a movie with lower expectation and still been as disappointed as i was with the hobbit i watched the first minutes had to stop watched more had to stop i have another day left on my amazon prime rental and am not planning on finishing it its unbearable to be fair all of the disappointment comes as a direct result of having had so much respect for and enjoyment of the original three lotr movies 
the book is filled with mystery and charm the movie is a neurological attack on the mind it must have s of cuts hordes and hordes and hordes of ugly little beings that never stop coming and have no frightening qualities because the script is dull and the acting worse at least the ring movies had some strong personalities even they by the mid part of the nd movie had become pretentious fantasy redundant boredom green screen animation is wrecking the movies no character subtly no need to create script tension lets just get to the effects an ugly boring small never ending troll car chase dont 
part of yet more sweeping vistas more sweeping music more crying hobbits more stuff that didnt really occur in the book a great childrens book ground up for adult consumption warning do not let your children see this have them read the book 
i was overall happy with tlotr and suspected due to its popularity that they would give us a live version of the hobbit as a tolkien jackson fan i was ready to spend more money and enjoy the hobbit then i began to hear rumors that it was going to be another trilogy and i thought there was no way they could stretch this book into three movies when i read about how they were going to do it pulling other material from other sources to fill in the blanks i began to get nervous this book is not about smaug the hobbit not about gandalf the hobbit not about the necromancer the hobbit not about thorin the hobbit not about anything else but the hobbit the ring is such a very small part of this story that its amazing tlotr was written at all all of you who remember the book also remember that there is no part of the book that doesnt involve bilbo we dont witness the death of smaug were only told about it when bard tells bilbo that the thrush delivered his message we dont witness the battle of five armies because bilbo in unconscious during the battle there is so much material about middle earth that wb could have probably given us another movies in a tales from middle earth type format there was no need to try and smash all these other stories under this one title the movie slashes from one story to another and its confusing even to those of us familiar with the background events they have added to this adventure the characters themselves are so different from the book that if different names had been used i doubt we would even recognize them the mostly amazing cgi work done in tlotr makes this product seem childish by comparison the wholly ridiculous ride on the stone giants knee ah d doesnt make it any better the dumb looking trolls and goblin orc king along with the disney type escape on the rail cart from the goblin orc tunnels another part not in the book because while they are escaping bilbo is dealing with gollum another small add to that now according to the jackson wb version of the tale bilbo really did steal the ring in the book he finds it in tlotr he finds it only to realize later that the ring was gollums in this version he watches the ring fall out of gollums pocket and steals it another major fault to this movie is how obvious it was rushed to the big screen say what you want about the lotr release no one can say the battle scenes small and large were not spectacular in this movie you wonder whether any battle choreography was done at all from the battle with the trolls to the tunnel escape we have our adventurers swinging their axes and swords this way and that with no reason until cgi throws an orc into the picture to receive the blow or the troll says ouch and then continues on as if nothing happens i have mentioned only a couple of items where our wb jackson team totally ignore the original tale if i were to write about all of them this review would be just as long as this very bad rendition of tolkiens classic classic guys this is a classic how dare you think you can do a better job of presenting this story than tolkien i always understand and have no problem with editing and changing the story a bit to bring a classic to the big screen but way to many of your changes were unnecessary and ruin the story and i mean ruin it i truly believe if tolkien were alive today he would have enjoyed tlotr release he would have understood the changes that were made as the tale was brought to the screen and just as sure as i am that he would have liked tlotr i am just as sure that he would not have like what they have done to this book in almost every case the was just no need to change the story as much as they have if you really love the hobbit i suggest you watch the animated made for tv version from the s give this one a miss its not the hobbit icing on the cake because of this fiasco its highly unlikely we will ever see another live version of this wonderful novel years before its even considered probably i wont get to see it to old thanks pete
this should be an engaging exciting and fast moving movie the director failed on all three points this movies adds a lot of things that arent part of the story they dont add to the movie it only tells of the story we had to watch on night and they rest another night because it is too long they story isnt told and there really is no point to watching i was really disappointed at the end the character portrayals were poor the special effects were also poor my suggestion you can read the book in less time and enjoy an amazing story 
i was appalled by what a mess jackson made of the hobbit he took a simple charming tale and warped back to the lord of the rings which he had already butchered his pale anorexic looking bilbo baggins was ridiculous has he ever read the book how about the description of hobbits at the beginning of the book this was about the worst i ever spent 
 this review may contain spoilers i hated pretty much everything about this movie but here are the main points expanding on tolkiens mythology presumably the reason you should never trust an elf gimlis line in tfotr is because elves turned their back on the dwarfs when they were being attacked by smaug what were they expected to do against a dragon and why were they just standing there anyway this is basically adding a whole new level of mythology a no no unless its an improvement and thats not the case here the dwarfs they looked ridiculous to me and their behavior was annoying but no dwarf was more off putting than thorin with his ludicrous fur trimmed leather duster rob zombie do and constant glowering ugh the introductory scene takes too long but given all this time youd think jackson would try and be more faithful to the book but no he still manages to mangle it anyway the next day after bilbo has decided not to go the day before he wasnt really given the choice in the book he just goes and its very interesting that hes able to on foot overtake gandalf and the dwarfs all riding along briskly on horseback and when he does catch up hes offered a pony which he at first declines why bilbo had nothing against riding a pony azog the footnote springs to cinematic life and has a vendetta against thorin the character in the lotr appendix for all of his two pages of appearance and death at the hands of d aacute in is still more bad ass than the video game reject in auj anyway if jackson wanted to go this route it would have made more sense to just go with azogs son bolg who will appear anyway trolls or how to take an amusing sequence from the book and drain it of any humor whatsoever actually that opinion that applies to the whole movie but instead of gandalf employing ventriloquism on the trolls and getting them to fight each other bilbo tells them the dwarfs have parasites and gandalf gets to break a rock in two yawn radagast an utterly ridiculous and repellent visualization of another footnote character with his ridiculous dying hedgehog rabbit drawn sleigh and poo smeared face but thats just my opinion but why is he in the movie at all to tell gandalf about the necromancer i guess but if gandalf doesnt already know this as he does in the book where did he get the map and key from thr aacute in thorins father who in the book was a prisoner in dol guldur presumably he wasnt in dol guldur in the movie so where is he its basically glossed over in any case the very idea that greenwood is turning into mirkwood right before radagasts eyes at the start of the movie just strikes me as a desperate and weak attempt to create a sense of urgency and menace the spiders are even seen entering the forest as if to take up their positions also in any case gandalfs very reason for being in middle earth is to help combat the necromancer aka sauron for him not to know about his presence in mirkwood is sorry just witless apparent invulnerability none of the protagonists get hurt in this movie stone giants fall on them they get up they fall a hundred feet they just walk it off goblins who for some reason are portrayed as distinct from orcs attack in droves they just cut them down like wheat thorin does later fall unconscious from a blow that should have crushed his skull but he later turns out none the worse for wear even if these characters werent profoundly irritating why should i care about them if theyre not in any danger and enough with the fake deaths did anyone watching this really fear the titular character might fall to his death halfway through his own movie riddles in the dark finally some resemblance to the book except even here there are details changed for no good reason and couldnt they have toned down the lighting just a bit more to give some impression of darkness as for gollum himself its hard to find fault with andy serkis except that gollum is now basically a celebrity and practically played like one in the film he no longer surprises frightens or disturbs in the least the cosy lighting doesnt help at all bilbo the badass bilbo kills a warg which though strong enough to uproot a tree will drop with a single arrow or sword thrust hack later he savagely kills an orc whered this come from perhaps to make up for frodo being a wuss in those other movies whatever the case its so far out of left field its just seems tacked on eagles gandalf just happens to spot a moth nearby in the tree hes climbed up to avoid the orcs and wargs how convenient and the books explanation for the eagles doesnt work because there really is no good reason jackson wants to make full use of the eagles but only as devices hes averse to giving them any back story or personality or anything youd think with his apparent love of exposition and the characters making speeches all the time something could have been said about them but no the eagles just drop them off and depart theyre nothing more than deus ex machina granted there are challenges to following the book more closely here but i still think jackson takes the cheap way out final scene bilbo blithely states i do believe the worst is behind us really why would he believe this while looking at a mountain that is still leagues distant and he knows contains a fire breathing dragon i will be surprised if even morbid curiosity compels me to watch any more of these 
this is a disappointment the film is so dark for the first minutes it is hard to see what is going on the sound is muddled muffled throughout he film and the music overpowers the dialogue if you havent read the hobbit good luck trying to figure out what is going on a real waste of time and money 
its magic peter jackson took a first rate work of literature and turned it into a fifth rate video game dont waste your time with this one stick with the trilogy which i love and admire 
 the hobbit an unexpected journey the title is correct the entire film is an unexpected journey into mr jacksons distorted imagination i have read the book at least nine times if mr jackson read it once he must have been reading between the lines 
poor acting poor screenplay poor music poor directing poor cinematography very disappointing and i loved lord of the rings dont know what book this movie was based on as it only vaguely resembled the hobbit 
really thought they could have done more with the big humanoid guy and the story disappointing guess there is no improving on the chilling suspenseful action packed first alien with ms weaver the magnificant still the scariest movie ive ever seen 
maybe this movie is acceptable with a younger audience my age seriously i could go on a very long rant about how dumb this movie is i put this on my watch list because it had many positive reviews i rarely get my husband to sit down and watch a movie with me we both were amazed at the pure stupidity of the plot or lack there of trust me just dont waste your time the only reason we finished it is because we were riding our trainers and it would have been difficult to put on a new movie the trailer did make it look interesting however i cannot actually find words to express how silly and lame this movie is beware 
the ghost of jar jar binks is back ruining what could have been a good movie this time he shows up as the two bumbling fools the guys who do everything wrong and defy all logic one guy is basically begbie from trainspotting looks kinda like him sounds kinda like him and acts kinda like him who takes psychopaths on the most important mission ever ridley scott apparently then you have the bigger idiot who is basically skipper from sex and the city goofy naive etc i propose that someone edit this movie removing every moment of these guys on screen i am sure well at least have a better movie everything they are involved in is a subplot at best and does not really affect the shit hitting the fan even if it does a little mystery could go a long way i might be able to forgive the daddy doesnt love me stuff and the really tacked on ending please dont let rs ruin blade runner with a twilight career sequel 
wow what a deep deep movie its depth more than makes up for the horrible pacing the characters range from unlikeable to flat out idiotic which is always the hallmark of an intellectual film oh wait i forgot about the redshirts there are a lot of redshirts in this movie at one point a creature comes back to the ship and wastes a whole bunch of people and for the life of me i didnt know what any of their names were i asked someone who is a fan of the movie and i believe their names were mercenary mercenary mercenary and mercenary well at least its pretty to look at if you like painted turds this movie is for you 
i just finished watching it the reviewer with the q a got it all right my mouth was on the floor it makes anaconda look like shakespeare well at least anaconda knows youre laughing with it not at it plus anaconda has much better bad acting and funnier bad dialogue and anacondas plot is actually more believable in an unbelievably bad sort of way if you like watching train wrecks this ones for you i recommend getting your pals down to the man cave ingesting mass quantities of your substance of choice and howling until your bellies ache seriously the blunders of the characters are so incredible as to make any clueless teen in a slasher flick seem like a genius this one is not to be believed 
the only things that were good about this film are the visuals and michael fassbender who honestly is the only actor in this film worth talking about if the rest of the film was as incredible as fassbenders performance then this movie would have been an absolute masterpiece what killed this film was the troubled script and poor performances by several key actors there are a lot of great ideas represented in this movie but unfortunately a lot of bad ideas too 
based on this movie i guess we can all look forward to a future with awesome technology controlled by people even more ignorant and arrogant than we have today it amazes me that so much time and money can go into making a film and still the finished product contains a host of bad ideas poor direction and inconsistent characters the story is primarily populated with a collection of scientists who are all deeply unstable and emotionally overwrought on a planet billion light years from earth they take one ridiculous risk after another ignoring all standards of science but i guess that makes sense because the film seems to have a religious message to push as well there are several references to intelligent design and the only surviving character wears a cross which she is overly concerned about and uses phrases like the year of our lord please next time save the preaching and make a smart movie 
read a j bullocks wonderful spearing of this totally dopey plot first then decide if you have a thirteen year old pimply faced boys mind and if so dive into this mis mash of typical james cameron type nonsense go on to ignore the incoherence and the destruction of the scientific method enjoy the total improbabilities and smile at the end like the village idiot because your rationality has been completely scrambled by this ridiculous movie like camerons and others pseudo sci fi babble this movie is only pictures and does nothing but tarnish scotts film making record be sure to remember any reviewer who praises this movie and discount all later reviews by that paid off writer its visual large scale is of course lost on your smaller screen at home and all you are left with is something you wish you did not have and you hide from your friends in the dark hole along with avatar and the sinking boat movie 
i think whoever did this movie just used all the alien movies i hardly saw anything original and was extremely disappointed i thought for sure this was going to be the sci fi movie of the year but not even close anyone who has watched the alien movies will see a much too close resemblance to scenes from those movies if you watch it dont expect anything except a let down it also seems like they set it up for a sequel which i also expect will be a skip it movie 
i am not going to say this film is leading to the decline of our culture i will leave that for twilight and the like but this film has a really weak script and dialogue and emotional sequences that just dont fit in at all its pretty ing hard to believe this guy was involved with something like alien or blade runner in particular the latter film being one of the greatest films of all time in my book and alien not far behind this one well it certainly had the chance to be completely awesome and it just comes across like some high budget made for tv film why can they no get competent script writers and people to tell these guys this stuff resembles really weak storytelling and acting as others have pointed out the incompetence of this high tech culture is a little unbelievable and the situations they find themselves in are just a little too much to bear it is well shot and the settings are very cool i just wish more talent and taste were put into the film at the point one guy addresses an alien snake creature with hey baby hey baby i almost had to call it quits that is about all you need to know i am willing to say at this point that ridleys late brothers films are quite underrated many of them with great scripts to be honest compared to the blockbuster flicks the elder is putting out i mean you find an alien creature and the thing looks horrifying and is staring at you as it slithers up from a pool and you sit there addressing it with that really how about when the captain asks charlize if she is a robot and then they go sleep together as she proves she is not one or something wtf seriously roomi and the lead male are totally miscast just insane how bad they are this film pretty much ruins it for me your mileage may differ but roomi is by far the worst here looking like someone totally different from the love interest the male would truly be into her lines are cold and without much emotion at all beyond that it doesnt get much better people just walk around and into trouble looking scared dumb interested mysterious and a whole lot of them like to push fancy buttons 
special effects were amazing but i was embarrassed to hear that ridley scott just wanted have fun while making this movie well ridley if you wanted to have fun while making a movie and have millions of people pay their hard earned cash to watch it why not just youtube yourself while riding a go cart for hours and yelling weeeeeee at the top of your lungs at certain intervals to keep us entertained using the scientists who were fatally attacked by the alien white snakes was actually supposed to be comic relief according to the director makes sense why else would a scientist that is lost in a bunch of dark tunnels on an alien planet use his helmet as a holder for bong smoke and lets use the old cliches were going to explore a possibly hostile planet but you better not carry your weapons you dont know what might be out there the white alien snakes the moment i saw them hunting down the scientists i knew exactly where they were headed up some ones as or down someones throat since watching slither night of the creeps it was inevitable another cliche hey im bored lets have sex and lets talk about the impossible circles with people pointing at them crudely drawn on cave walls some pointing right some pointing left from these crude drawings a course was plotted hundred trillion miles away how in the hell do they know which way to go this takes place in folks were in already my gps system re routes miles after giving it instructions and here theyre plotting a course from drawings on a cave wall written in crayon of circles which they decided is trillion miles away yeah okay for all we know those people could have been pointing at turds that refused to flush and they needed an intergalactic plumber to help them they were standing at a distance from the circles if you hadnt noticed another impossibility running at break neck speed with charlize theron after a cesarean birth charlize theron can run and to try keeping up with her after an operation okay oh yeah and a vindictive android that just took the cake ridley no lets add icing to said cake a vindictive android that dyes his hair because he admires peter otoole and watches lawrence of arabia no wonder michael fassbender opted out on the sequel which was too bad hes the only reason i watched the movie in the first place 
so let me get this straight ancient astronauts are found and we make our way to their home world its the first contact with aliens when they get there the crew starts a bunch of petulant behavior and the chief scientist starts boozing it up geez hollywood i guess you assume your entire audience is a bunch of freaking retards well i suppose youre right i spent and all i got was seconds of where the alien came from hint from a guys gut actually come to think of it there was four bucks worth of information in this movie if you are ever trying to run away from a giant ring shaped space ship that is falling down toward you and rolling along its perimeter turn degrees and run rather than run along the path of the falling space ship 
i purchased this disc set twice the first purchase the d film disc played back with much large macro blocking of magenta and green obscuring the image at first i thought i must need a new version of firmware to bring my bluray player up to date so i contacted panasonic and they sent me a revised f w disc once i installed the new cd r with new f w the problem was the same so i returned the set to amazon and ordered a second copy assuming i got a bad disc the second one arrived and i had the same problem doing some online searching i found i was not alone depending on which bluray player you own this particular disc may not play it looks like certain panasonic and sony players will not play this disc without macroblocking other makes and models do sure wish there was more uniformity on bluray characteristics so these issues would not happen from time to time on new discs 
i cant describe how bad this movie was others have done so nevertheless i must weigh in the trailers for this film had me on the edge of my seat i thought for certain this was going to be a billion dollar hit the answers to thirty years of wondering would finally be answered what we got instead was a bait and switch and plot holes large enough to fly a star destroyer through lets start with the bait and switch the imagery from the commercial leads one to believe that we will find out who the space jockey as hes known was and how his ship came to crash on lv but very soon in the film we learn this is not lv so this cant be the space jockey from alien they tricked us with regards to the plot holes i wont go into all of them my lunch break is only an hour but seriously a crew of scientists spend a few years and trillion dollanrs getting to an alien planet and are about to enter a structure obviously built by intelligent life yet nobody is allowed to bring a weapon and the guy who maps out the alien space ship cant find his way off the space ship i can mapquest my way to dunkin donuts to within th of a mile and theyre in the future in screen writing which i took the teacher would circle the above passages and mark on your paper lazy writing or not logical then hed tell you to try harder i could go on but why bother another thing that disturbed me was how people made statements like people didnt get it or some viewers just couldnt understand what was going on right im stupid not the people in the movie then they said something like all your questions will be answered in the next film not for me they wont just my opinionby david feeney authorterror on the high seas
i thought a movie with logan marshall green couldnt be so bad since i could just watch his scenes and drool and at least that might be great but no i was freaking wrong this movie was awful even charlize theron was terrible in it maybe i dont get it but i did not get the appeal of this movie at all 
good science fiction movies are hard to come by i wanted to like this movie i really did but i just couldnt it is filled with cliched characters story gimmicks from other movies borrowed from avatar star wars star trek and a female character who pants moans and screams her way through the whole thing it just got too much and the pay off was ludicrous when ridley scott is good he is very very good but when he is bad he is unbearable i recommend you skip this 
i had high hopes for this movie but it was a big disappointment great special effects and stunning visuals but a plot that made no sense and that relied strictly on basic horror imagery from the previous alien franchise really a shame 
its supposed to be science fiction not science absurdity when the scientist takes off his helmet minutes into it you know things are going to go down hill i would say a rd grader would know better than to do that needless to say the cgi and locations are impressive thats pretty easy now days but really almost anyone could improve the story a child could have improved the story the monster had to get on board the way it does that is just beyond belief suspension of disbelief is part of any movie but this one stretches that to absurd levels almost as if they tried to write a script in a week for a million dollar movie why the hell would they do that totally sloppy i mean really really sloppy did they mix up pages from the round file story makes no sense even from the creation point of mystery view id almost rather they used the entire time to fly the camera over scotland and iceland which are so beautiful in their harshness forget the science fiction just give me visuals of the beautiful landscapes 
first read take the scientists survival pop quiz v in the review section this movie reminded me of gilligans island idiots doing stoooopid things just to make a show the charactors were so endearing one didnt care they got offed darwin at its finest i sure am glad i didnt spend the money to see this in a theater although i did get suckered in to paying for the dvd my bad anyone want to buy a slightly used movie 
this is yet another hollywood product that envisions portrays life as an extension of or proxy for high school although the actors themselves are obviously older they are transparently playing year olds noomi rapace stars as an over the top spoiled brat drama queen and there are the requisite doofuses and other stock characters of this genre the characters adventures are a result of a mix of their impulsiveness rebelliousness recklessness carelessness and other compulsive and pointless risk taking behaviors enhanced by stupidity and inexperience although it conforms to the teen horror movie convention of having characters take the most unimaginably stupid actions it does not qualify as a horror movie because the surprises arent plus i had no empathy for any of the characters and the only mild suspense came from monitoring my own reactions did i think that this character deserved to die a slow gruesome death or did i simply want him her dead quickly so that the movie would be closer to being over turned out to always be the latter from the reviews i knew to expect a mediocre movie in terms of plot but i watched for the visuals not worth it although extensive the cgi seemed quite mundane but it may simply have been overwhelmed by the massive unrelenting stupidity of the rest of the movie and some of the key visuals contributed to the sense of stupid stupid stupid one of the strengths of the alien movie was its claustrophobic feel and that it conveyed the impression of a real working freighter it was packed cluttered gritty and suffering from wear and tear in this movie the inspiration for the ships interior comes from mansions dressed for a photo shoot the rooms are humongous and sparsely furnished leaving vast open spaces even the oversized beds which seem intended to accommodate partying with multiple simultaneous guests dont make a dent in the floor space of the various living quarters douglas b moran
love some of the alien movies but this was complete garbage plot script holes of a mind numbing nature characters did things no one w half a brain would attempt completely ridiculous script and story epically stoopid cant believe this flick made it to the theaters an embarrassment for everyone involved what more to say 
this review is not about the movie it is about the d a lot of people say the d is very good so i hope that mine is just defective i almost fell to the floor and had a grand mal seizure attack watching the blurryness of the movements horrible d quality on the one sent to me no it is not my tv and player because all my other ds work fine 
an endless series of missed opportunities inane plotting poor acting feckless directing and banal writing punctuated by some very good special effects and now scott intends to direct a second blade runner movie too apparently in an ongoing effort to ruin his reputation as one of the most important science fiction directors of all time god help us 
my wife was the smart one and slept through most of it there are so many memorably dumb things in this movie the characters spend at least minutes of the running time walking through the same tunnels looking at stuff a lady scientist cuts her belly all the way across including her uterus pulls out a huge alien then gets stapled together and walks around like she hasnt just had major surgery another scientist plays with a threatening snake alien like its a squirrel then is completely shocked when it eats his face off and to top it all off theres a young actor inexplicably made up in the worst old man makeup ive seen since ed wood was alive instead of using an actual older actor the director made up his nephew or something to play the part its not the dollar and a half i wasted renting it that drove me to amazon to post a review it was the hours of my life i will never get to live over 
awful movie even for sci fi it pushes the envelope not to mention it just sucks as a prequel even if people say it isnt a prequel 
in a word dumb writing at a year old level incredibly inappropriate casting marginal premise i would have expected better from scott who did such a great job with the initial alien somewhere around the third sequel the look and feel changed from believable sci fi to mtv this continues the trend with hip hop dudes and dudettes replete with tats attitude and street language posing as accomplished professionals of course we have to have a baddy corporate babe concerned only with profits no modern sci fi is replete without that somewhere ridley forgot about story and just went for a minimally connected sequence of effects punctuated by oh my gods and other shouts of incredulity diehard fans like me will see it at least once not twice i dont think 
i gave alot of thought to reviewing this film i think the scientist survival pop quiz really said it all but one of the things this movie has managed to do is spark alot of discussion debate its still going on so i thought id add my cents the stunning visuals within this huge budget piece will take your breath away the sets computer generated scenics effects are pretty well unmatched in our time that being said it seems as if all that cool beautiful stuff distracted the film makers from everything else they ignored the fact that the characters were becoming more senseless unlikeable as the film progressed as was the script in fact it seemed at times as if they were making it up as they went along for a movie to look so beautiful have such annoying characters doing idiotic things throughout is unforgivable i watched the short documentary direct effect to try to gain some understanding of ridley scotts creative vision unfortunately i found him to be just as ambiguous contradictory as the plot of prometheus in fact he seemed like he was a bit drunk the only other good thing i can say about prometheus is that it has a great trailer the film itself is a potential grand work of art ruined by knuckleheads 
prometheus is a mixed up messed up prequel to the alien series and you would do best just to avoid seeing this at all i loved the alien series and am a huge sci fi fan but this film is a jumble of different ideas and stories forced together into one big pile granted some of the cgi effects are great but in the end you will see that there were so many plot holes in the story it dissolved and floated away i certainly hope there is no sequel to this oh and the acting is terrible too 
i just tried watching this movie again to see if it is still as astonishingly bad and stupid as it seemed when i came out of the theater massively disappointed a couple years ago yep its written by people who clearly never met a scientist or even a moderately intelligent human being it plays like scott forgot everything he knew about filmmaking thirty years earlier maybe someday he will release a four hour directors cut that explains why all the scientists are such imbeciles fills in some of the mammoth plot holes gives us at least a little bit of reason to care about any of the characters and provides some kind of logical motivation for the whole preposterous exercise or maybe not 
this is not the most banal derivative and predictable sci fi fable ive ever seen but by vishnu its close there are a couple of interesting embellishments the use of lawrence of arabia odd man out as david droids role model and the astonishing waste of guy pearce in a wrinkle mask as the geezer in charge but really the scientist who wears a cross like we need help in figuring out what the question is the idea that theres a sequel in the works only confirms that once a juggernaut is constructed the momentum cannot be stopped see stan lee no i take that back dont sure ill see the sequel only to check on whether david droid gets to become a real boy 
the real review is relatively short and separated from the following rant for ease in reading you could watch instead planet of the vampiresforbidden planetthe thingthis is about as bad a prequel as phantom menace if anything it may be worse overall it appears to be bad for roughly the same reasons first like the star wars prequels the director seems to have started with a bunch of scenes they wanted to do for special effects reasons then attempted to stitch them together after the fact like star wars the overall concept of what the movie is about and specific scenes either fail to connect or conflict the characters are illogical and make mistakes yes but on a more basic level they dont make sense as people characters are driven by emotion not logic so we cant fault them for making the occasional mistake but the characters act with no motivation or in a way that invalidates previously established motivation or basic aspects of their character as a result i dont like relate to care about any of these characters im a little bit intrigued by the android until he too turns out to be nonsensical by making the actions of people incoherent contradictory stupid and inconsistent theyre made into non characters they arent believable as people id say there isnt much of a plot an actual narrative per se there is no discernable character arc for any of the characters you could describe what happens on their mission in a sentence or two the film is awfully derivative there seems to be a lot of borrowing from different places maybe leviathan and stargate most of this film stole scenes or concepts directly from alien vs predator alien and aliens however the award goes to star trek next generation season episode the chase in which an ancient humanoid race referred to as the founders is sought by scientists due to the result of archaeological research and found to have seeded their own dna billions of years ago on other planets giving rise to other humanoid races including of course humans theyre kind of albino ish looking with strong brow ridges and bald heads so overall id say if you watch something like forbidden planet or planet of the vampires youll be more satisfied maybe even more satisfied with the green slime end of the overview but i cant resist going into a few more specific diatribes some specific examples of bad filmakinglazy characterization the lead female scientist has faith not in christianity per se but just a generally faith y disney its maaagic kinda person how do we know other characters tell her shes a believer several times and she wears a cross yet shes following a line of thinking that directly contradicts the cross she wears maybe shed have been more believable if she was referred to as a dreamer and mystic show her hanging a dreamcatcher over her bed reading crowley and chariots of the gods have her talk about a few other off the wall ideas to establish a general hunger for strangeness and hidden mystery as it was she was a person with two diametrically opposed beliefs and no inner tension worse shes a scientist and a christian but believes without specific evidence that the figures in various ancient illustrations created humanity so she strays from both her main character traits her faith and her science a person who doesnt even value their own values is difficult to like as a protagonist lazy science fiction they reference ancient civilizations all having the same star map and include cave men the mayans and the babylonians so youve got cave painters from bc babylonians from bc and mayans from ad cited as all ancient and all having the same star map what they didnt want to drop off the same map for atilla constantine diocletian or charlemagne with the other civilizations cited it implies engineers being constantly on earth interacting with humans for essentially all of human history so they were around for years then decided they felt like getting rid of us then at that convenient moment but not anytime in the years before destroyed themselves with their own weapons just at the perfect moment and apparently the engineers at this one facility were the only ones to know this needed to be done if we are to believe the engineer in the first shot was on a very early earth we should remember life started maybe billion years ago which is a long wait to decide you made a bad go of it but lets assume they only intended to modify existing life youd probably need to arrive close to the development of invertabrates to at least have some chance of influencing local evolution to lead to an engineer like creature so they could have shown up for the cambrian explosion which still gives them about million years to mull over the fate of all life on earth of course to think that various influences that cause mutation leading to evolution such as cosmic radiation hitting the earth for million years straight not to mention evolutionary pressures ie a different environment planet could possibly allow for convergent evolution leading to a specific body plan reveals a deep deep non understanding of science in general and in multiple disciplines like this was what they wanted the movie to be about but they couldnt be bothered to crack a single book on the subject does the story of prometheus take place in a heliocentric universe by chance or is the earth flat are humans assumed to be composed of substances humors lazy writing and choice of scenes a surprising amount of time in prometheus is spent setting up the same scenario as a single scene in aliens the same plot with the same exact plan the evil corporation plans to expose a human being to alien contagion then transport them back to earth in suspended animation in aliens it was a quick suspenseful scene and it made sense the corporate guy did it because he was seeking profit at everyone elses expense in prometheus it doesnt make any sense the android has no personal motivation to do it and the guy who owns and controls the corporation is there onboard for a completely different purpose than profit in fact introducing an uncontrolled unknown never before studied contagion on board could greatly threaten his project and of course his life why do they do it then not for any goal but because er its what happened in another alien movie so it happens because thats what happens in these movies like ridley scott wanted to make a non aliens prequel that was big concept and thoughtful and did new things therefore decided he needed to re do the same thing covered by cameron in the first alien sequel wtf lazy lazy writing to rehash a previously and well explored idea characters that work against their own purposes if they knew a monster would result from the trick having it inside the ship would kill the crew and perhaps the billionaire and thus ruin his mission and end his life when he came there to extend his life or if they had no idea what it would do it hardly made sense to set it loose outside of a lab environment considering how paranoid they were about living in a lifeboat most of the movie is taken up with people doing things that make no sense and things that make no sense happening even making no sense in terms of the plot or story or just the basic idea for the film such as why rehash previously explored alien movie subplots the movie is about the big picture alien gods as opposed to alien monsters but the engineer we meet is essentially indistinguishable from the no longer sentient crazed spider monkey former crew member that goes berzerk or having the automated medical system software not have any directions loaded for females wouldnt it come standard wouldnt the old millionaire want it to be capable of helping his daughter who he was dependent on while he was in coldsleep moreover shouldnt it be unable to operate at all under those conditions these are all considerations that reveal the movie as stupid but consider it from the writers perspective from outside the story they planned to have this character do the decathalon within hours of a cesarean section sprinting jumping getting smashed by an alien and thrown across the room jumping and landing heavily on things climbing more sprinting more climbing assuming the writers decided the same character must go through both the operation and feats of athleticism instead of using two different characters or giving her time to heal do you really want to go out of your way to have the medical system state it is not equipped to take care of women maybe you could argue that futuristic technology makes it all possible but not when you have that technology itself tell the audience it isnt set up to help dumb nonsensical writing alien was about a bunch of space truckers who get re routed from their normal job by their employer unexpectedly and run into something they cant handle theyre essentially expendables for a corporation who thinks first of profit and last of their safety despite the fact that they arent scientists they still worry about basic safety things like quarantine conversely the owner of the corporation himself takes his a team out on a mission with him for the purpose of saving himself from death and they appear to be universally foolish incompetent and generally not a personality types they dont seem to have much concern for each other or even their own lives let alone their jobs youd want a cast of sophisticated scientists and professionals for prometheus to replace the hapless space truckers of alien because you want characters capable of the kind of nuanced depthful discussions and actions needed to address the big questions of the film instead you have a badly written teenage slasher film with some of the best special effects ever i recommend scream or i know what you did last summer over prometheus a small example of character development character arc in prometheus shaw dreamily flakily i want to visit that planet because i believe they are our creators and i want to meet them i believe that because i believe it aghast horrified we should have never come here we were so so wrong dreamily flakily i want to visit that planet because i believe they are our creators i want to meet them so i can ask them why terrified urgently if you dont stop that ship there wont be any home to go back to dreamily flakily i want to visit that planet because i believe they are our creators and i want to meet them ill just show up so they know we werent wiped out yet and present myself for interrogation assuming they dont kill me on sight with an andriod that has a head full of information about earth and one of their ships with a flight path theyll be able to follow back to this planet where theyll find the remains of our own ship and our intact lifeboat both full of information the navigation databases certainly showing the location of earth along with most likely every major human settlement so i can ask them why 
i cant recall when i last saw a movie so derivative so imitative so unoriginal sure it has its moments but i found it to be a major disappointment its makers took a potentially compelling thought provoking plot and reduced it to an alien sequel granted it really does deserve more than a single star just for the storm sequence alone but considering what i perceive to be the laziness involved shamelessly recycling the previously done one lousy star is what ill give it 
story is weak characters are cardboard fx mundane waste of rapaces talent and looks aliens was so good this is so bad 
this film is nothing more than a rip off of aliens vs predator and the st x files movie in aliens vs predator theres an expedition led by a woman to a far off place antartica its financed by a billionaire called weyland whos dying once there they discover that the ancient gods people worshiped are actually aliens predators weyland comes face to face with one of them and it kills him now lets look at prometheus theres an expedition led by a woman to a far off place another planet its financed by a billionaire called weyland whos dying once there they discover that the ancient gods people worshiped are actually aliens the engineers weyland comes face with one of them and it kills him does any of this sound familiar in the x files movie theres a black alien goo that takes people over and physically changes them just like in prometheus at the end of the x files movie the heroine is running across a fractured surface trying to outrace a big alien spaceship thats coming up from the ground beneath her just like in prometheus whats worse than all of this is that prometheus doesnt even match up with alien itself in that movie the space jockey engineer is found dead in that big chair onboard the alien ship in prometheus hes killed in a completely different location also in alien when the nostromo lands on the planet how come they dont find any of the wreckage of the prometheus that fell all over the place after it crashed into the alien ship the fault isnt with ridley scott but the lousy writers lets hope ridley can do better if he ever gets around to making the blade runner sequel 
i practically started snoring while watching this movie it is just beyond me why everyone thinks it is so great i am a big sci fi and fantasy genre lover so its not that i was out of my element i just genuinely thought this movie was an over hyped mess you can barely see anything on the screen through the whole movie for one thing its one of those awful films where everything on the screen is incredibly dark i thought charlize therons character was just uninteresting as well as most of the other characters i couldnt find anything to get excited about or be invested in so i hung on through about of the film and then just couldnt take it anymore fade to black 
yes this is full of spoilers but really the movie is so bad that it doesnt matter i just wasted two hours of my life let me preface this by saying that i am a huge sic fi fan i loved alien blade runner is one of my favorite movies but this movie just didnt make any sense at all none of the characters were developed about half of the crew only appeared on the screen to die the science didnt make any sense the actions of the characters didnt make any sense questions why would the biologist run away from dead bodies and then try to play with an aggressive alien snake thing how could the engineer dna match human dna even though they look totally different how could a geologist who just mapped the entire cave system with his probe pups become lost why would the head of the corporation hide on the ship instead of just being honest about it why does no one seem to care to ask why a woman who just gave herself an emergency c section is running around the ship in her underwear covered in blood what happened to the characters who tried to subdue shaw im pretty sure she didnt kill them but they never seemed to appear again and for goodness sake why dont they run sideways when the ship is rolling towards them oh there are so many more questions since this is pretending to be a prequel let me trace how we get to the xenomorph that were more familiar with from the alien franchise in the beginning of the film one of the engineers swallows a bunch of black dots which then completely destroy his dna and cause him to disintegrate android puts a single one of these black dots into the drink of a human so human becomes infected with dna destroying substance an hour later infected human has sex with another human and she becomes pregnant with something infected man is burned to death but then reawakens as a transformed maniac zombie that proceeds to kill everything in sight for no reason this is never explained after hours pregnant woman gives herself a c section and some sort of alien is pulled out but its not the alien after another day this alien manages to grow into a ft long tentacled beast the alien beast then infects an engineer who is also a maniac killer for reasons unbeknownst to me by jamming a tentacle down his throat and enveloping him an unspecified amount of time later the engineers chest bursts open and something crawls out now finally we have the xenomorph and then the movie ends summary black dot human sexual transmission to another human alien engineer xenomorph and this makes sense how and dont tell me it all makes sense because there are some fracking easter eggs or that the storytelling is so deep that its beyond my comprehension rubbish oh and if you knew an alien race was building up an arsenal and planning to come to earth to destroy all humans and you meet one of these aliens and he immediately tries to kill you would you then decide to go to their planet to ask them why if she had said hey android head lets take one of their ships and go kill these crazy aliens then i could understand that but instead she thinks that if she shows up on their doorstep theyll be amenable to questioning seriously ridley scott should be ashamed 
stupid plot ridiculous screenplay murky cinematography and some of the worst acting ive ever seen noomi papace is a very very unattractive and untalented actress charlize theron was pathetic its rare for me to say i really hated a film but i really hated this one 
good effects but thats it im getting a bit tired of effects driven movies in the end no real conclusion after all the mess that happened in the film nough said 
started watching this movie when it arrived in hopes for better the stupidity of the crew in almost every scene sequence made it impossible to buy into the story line in any amount that someone would mount what was billed in the early part of the movie as a fantastically expensive mission and staff the crew with idiots without a clue makes the entire plot ridiculous i finally turned it off when the idiot reached for the snake alien still havent had any interest in even finishing the movie to be fair im not a fear induced adreneline junkie but have seen the alien movies ive even rewatched a couple because sigorney at least got you to buy into the situation youd think if a movie was going to script a ship visiting the race that started mankind it could make them look smart enough to have actually made it there the movie industry has me as an easy mark for almost anything they put out in d because i love it however offerings like this one could eventually kill it off we need movies that will help support the format not b grade scifi horror movies compared to this movie the d remake of i robot was a terrific bargain half the price for times the movie 
i guess the script for this movie must have taken say minutes to write it is obviously totally derivative of aliens with more special effects less story same spaceship on dubious company business same robot as key perpetrator of said company business same deserted planet same dormant aliens waiting for dumb earthlings same plans to decimate earth same baseball cap to prepare for the ultimate heroic sacrifice big change this time is that the spaceship lands in a direct line to the buried spaceships aliens via a conveniently built road the actors are a very mixed bag noomi rapace is hard to reconcile as the the mesmeric energetic lead in the girl with the dragon tattoo her acting in prometheus is wooden to the nth degree and her facial features are reminiscent of someone post root canal the novocaine look and her hair how the remaining actors were able keep a straight face throughout is a mystery utter drivel with sub themes of religion and immortality oh and the master race ive seen tom and jerry cartoons that have better and more logical dialog and by that yardstick homer simpson is a thoughtful genius this movie is yet another sign of the decline of western culture aided and abetted by hollywood greed 
this movie tries to act oh so sophisticated but the story is a half hearted attempt at a prequel the script was inane the acting was overdone the only valid conclusion possible is that david is most definately a relative of ash alien wow down to the severed head and everything thats as good as it got this film stinks on ice but it sure cures insomnia better off not even viewing it and just watch alien and aliens once again sorry ridley 
the movie was so bad that when froze up so that i could not watch the rest of it i considered a christmas blessing 
my friends told me this is an awful movie yet i still rented it how bad could it be really really bad there are huge plot holes you could walk through this is supposed to be the prequel to first alien movie and it does a terrible job of explaining anything there are scenes that serve no purpose other than someone deciding there needed to be an action scene here if you dont listen to your friends like i should have then listen to the reviews dont rent this movie its hours of your life you will never get back 
this movie is awful for so many reasons which nobody will read because it already has reviews i just wanted to add my star review to the pile speaking of piles this movie was a steaming one i only sat through it because i was stuck on a hour bus ride and the driver put this in 
 will probably go down as the year of flops in hollywood we had count it big name bombs each of which had loads of special effects a cast full of superstars and months worth of preceding advertising on print online tv and big screen in no particular order they were prometheus from th century fox john carter from disney snow white and the huntsman by universal pictures battleship also by universal pictures and abraham lincoln vampire hunter by a consortium of production companies of these bombs prometheus was probably the one with the most hype as it built on the legacy of the alien films by sigourney weaver the movie was billed as part science fiction part adventure and lots of horror unfortunately it came across as more of s slapstick with gore than anything else scene after scene broke all boundaries of logic as if people were purposefully doing things to get killed the movies premise is simple sometime in the near future human scientists discover a series of archaeological relics that point to a star system far away that sent visitors to earth these scientists join a mission funded by a major corporation to travel to this star system joining them is a crew of security other scientists and the ceo of said company peter weyland and his daughter upon reaching their destination the crew of this voyage proceed to do everything possible to risk their lives and get each other killed in a variety of manners if you have ever seen the various incarnations of friday the th nightmare on elm street or halloween then you have an idea for the stupidity of the acting and screenwriting this is unfortunate because the original alien movies were smart and well written with characters that generally made smart if sometimes shortsighted choices not here not in this film whether it be the biologist of the crew getting killed by a snake like creature or the geologist getting lost in a structure he supposedly mapped or the crew deciding to do an autopsy of an alien creature in open air instead of inside a quarantined environment this film was a series of stupid scenes one after another the only saving graces of this film was the cinematography the special effects the majestic soundtrack and the oral language of the alien race glad they werent speaking english overall a very disappointing flick it fell below my expectations in every possible way 
we can create a short list of the attributes of this movie lets see dumb and incoherent script dumb characters dumb scientists that would seem to have been chosen for a hugely expensive space exploration by their level of incompetence and stupidity a deranged android one can easily imagine to be watching one of those awful and cheesy s science fiction movies if it not were for the beautiful and shamelessly wasted special effects of this one 
well once again i should have waited until i could acquire a used copy of this movie i did not like it at all i was very bored with it did not keep up my interest at all 
 way too many spoilers visually prometheus is a stunner the cgi and photography look fantastic you get your moneys worth in that regard the same cant be said for the script and characters which are dumber than a bucket of dirt heres why peter weyland who funds the expedition appears at the beginning of the film via recorded video introduces himself to the crew and reveals that by the time they see this he would be dead near the end of the film he re appears but in human form in the ship right there in the ship the question arises why the hell would weyland appear to be dead hide in his own bloody ship his own ship then casually re appear an hour or so later in the movie to ask the engineers to prevent his death from old age before heading out on their mission shaw informs jackson expedition security that this is a scientific expedition and that no weapons are allowed why was jackson included for the mission then if hes not allowed to carry weapons how will he defend the team in case real trouble arises on an alien planet on which no humans have ever set foot whats he going to use karate the judo chop fifields tantrum upon finding the first dead alien why would weyland choose a wimpy geologist who just loves rocks for an enormously expensive and potentially dangerous expedition to an alien planet gazillion miles from earth surely the suitable candidate for such a mission should be robust and prepared for any sort of emergency including finding dead weird stuff hes never seen before but instead fifield scampers off back to the ship taking scared stiff biologist millburn along with him where did weyland find these wimps why is david the programmed and therefore supposedly obedient and smart android so ill disciplined he opens alien doors without asking permission oops sorry he touches the stone cylinders without thinking sorry he inexplicably and intentionally poisons holloway with the black liquid not sorry i presume why doesnt he test the stuff in a lab first hes android gone wild and yet towards the end he helpfully and sincerely assists shaw to find another ship how touching aw before the storm arrives why do millburn and fifield wander around aimlessly in the caves theyre lost see and theyre smart too theyre scientists why then dont they ask help from prometheus who could easily guide them back to the ship via the mapping system which only recently had mapped out the entire cave fifield and millburn are scared of dead aliens apparently millburn is not scared of live alien snakes what does he do when hes confronted by a threatening alien snake he pets it of course fifield just stands by and watches why not makes perfect sense the snake then kills millburn even better with the help of a medicinal apparatus shaw performs abdominal surgery on herself to remove an alien host a squid shortly after she stumbles into a room filled with crew members nobody notices her exposed stomach with surgery staples the size of door handles nobody bothers to ask her excuse me but wtf happened to you nobody amazing huh whats more remarkable is that a mere few hours later she dashes around like an olympic athlete trying to get away from a ship completely pain free and mobile oh yes why doesnt holloway raise the alarm when he realizes hes infected by some weird bug thats crawling around in his eye you know have it looked at in the lab by his fellow scientists seems like the smart thing to do right no the smart thing would be to not tell a soul and become so ill that you request to be doused with fire and die a horrible painful death but of course why does shaw who remains a professional for the most part of the film suddenly act like a petulant child towards the end when the group and weyland confront the engineer why yell and scream like an irritable toddler at the engineer doesnt make one bit of sense shaw convinces janek to ram himself his two pilots and all of prometheus into the engineers craft it takes her only a few seconds to persuade three other human beings to give up their lives by turning their spacecraft into a giant fireball and they happily oblige just like that no questions no discussions really really when shaw and vickers run from the falling alien spacecraft why do they run in a straight line its obvious to everyone and their mother that if you just turn right or left just by a few meters that youll avoid the craft and save your life but noooooooo eventually shaw realizes this not vickers turns out shes not only a bitch but a stupid one too see if you break it down this movie is just unbelievably f ing stupid roger ebert awarded this film four stars ironic since hes always been an ardent crusader for films with intelligent scripts and characters strangely i do recommend this film grab your popcorn and soda but dont switch your brain on unfortunately nobody told me but now i can tell you you lucky devils 
ridley scotts first three films the duellists alien and blade runner established his reputation as one of the most fascinating directors of his time his intricate visual style which he called layering drew comparisons to stanley kubricks work but the comparison was not apt whereas kubrick wanted his visuals to serve his highly personal intellectual themes scott never strayed too far from his roots as a director of commercials scott always looks for arresting images which will indelibly remain in the viewers memory long afterwards hes not a great storyteller not a big idea man and has marked impatience as anyone who knows the story behind blade runner knows for those who are prometheus is a collection of arresting images and scenes which when considered as a story dont amount to much the writer a frequent jj abrams collaborator who helped turned star trek into execrement in met his usual qualitative standards here whereas alien was notorious for one gruesome scene prometheus spends its final hour on a flesh defiling parade of bodily penetrations and mutations in his youth scott bragged about his sense of restraint in alien he claimed that most of the horror in that film was inferred the septagenarian scott could learn a thing from that young man some vestiges of the good visualist remain the harsh beauty of icelands lava fields serves as both primordial earth and planet lv whatever if scott settled for an imax film about that beauty or showed some semblence of good taste during the latter stages of the film it wouldnt have felt as if one of his snake like uglies slithered in and picked my pocket instead scott conducted a symphony of pus and slime in an abatoir perhaps in anticipation of whats to come the space travelers find themselves retching as soon as they emerge from cryogenic sleep the themes such as they are are displeasing too an extra terrestrial source of humanity has been done before in science fiction most notably in kubricks and done better it seems that prometheus writer was watching an old episode of star trek the next generation the chase while working on his drafts even the progenitor seen on tv looks suspiciously familar prometheus is somehow sillier than this source material though evoking memories of erich von danikens book chariots of the gods in that popular early seventies work every exotic feature of an ancient statue or building was seen as evidence of extra terrestrial visitation though the protagonists of prometheus are scientists this film not only feels pseudo scientific weve come to expect that in sci fi cinema it actually feels anti scientific its not that scott cant be bothered to get things right its that he would rather be wrong in a nod to changing audience demographics scott makes his heroine a christian scientist too it makes one think of charlton hestons rebuke of his antagonist in s planet of the apes in which he sees a fundamental contradiction between his opponents joint role as both minister of science and defender of the faith theres also a clumsy misstep here its always a mistake for a bad film to refer to a good one scenes from lawrence of arabia are played here including some choice lines it starkly reminds viewers of how far cinema has sunk since those glorious days as well as how their time could be better employed but scott is right about one thing his images are indelible i sympathize with victims in the aliens films always pleading get it out get it out and ultimately kill me 
what a waste of money i wanted to see more of the big guy or more of the back story but it was just too much going on and not enough story 
why take a great sci fi movie alien and make a look alike movie that can barely walk this movie makes no sense and has holes poking through its holes lackluster acting and crew members that are literally stereotypes of all the folks weve all seen a zillion times before and would never want to hang out with in person in a word boring 
predictable boring stupid crap the writers fill holes with nonsense dont complete paths in the plot solutions are contrite and so un scientific for example picture yourself in the path of a giant bagel rolling toward you do you run along the path its traveling no you run away ok maybe a small spoiler even the alien history biology replication concept put forth in the aliens series is thrown to the wind only the special effects kept me from turning this off and they were not anything new sorry cannot recommend this at all 
the featured star awarded by mr bullock take the scientists pop quiz is so complete i wont duplicate his efforts however while believing that the plot logic appears written by an excited year old lets not dismiss the additional lengths one has to go to in order to neutralize both charlize theron and rapace the latter appearing more like a round faced girl scout than the girl from dragon tatoo and theron whose character looks so impressive is forced to deliver such a mindless script that you just shake your head at the waste of charlize this movie puts the nail in the coffin of my oh its a ridley scott movie a pov i had assumed since gladiator idris elba captain pilot also is asking us to believe you pilot a zillion dollar spaceship tricked out with cgid advanced technology but apparently give commands to the rest of the crew like the pilot of a bass fishing boat for me it felt jarring youre asked to believe they have all these hi tech gizmos but the writers dont even research any aeronautical military command nomenclature and or procedure for landing an aircraft resulting in something so casual its a combo of billy bob meets hans solo look how branaugh used elba in thor and as something worth comparing because the waste of such talent and cgi budget is handled so sloppily its difficult to believe that this is the same man that made gladiator 
if youre expecting an answer look elsewhere if youre expecting to be wowed by the storyline run dont just walk away from this movie a movie and a story with so much potential just falls on its face from almost the beginning what a disappointment 
this was a poorly written and played horror flick it absolutely sucked i rate it below the b movies i would not suggest this movie to anyone 
because i just buy sci fi and it look interesting and i kept waiting for it to get better it didnt so just save your money 
hands down the dumbest script ever from middle school earth science class drop out damon lindelof scientists who dont understand science lightweight spiritualism that makes a hacky sack playing faux buddhist white kids with dreadlocks sound deep and a deep and profound inability to understand anything at all about what motivated people it has all the earmarks of one of a lindelof script so bad it becomes funny for a little while and then gets worse so you can no longer enjoy it dumb dumb dumb dumb 
upon watching this hour train wreck unravel before my very eyes i couldnt help but think of my beloved tony scott and wonder if he was really the sibling suffering from brain cancer there really arent enough words to describe how truly awful prometheus is but if anyone out there can reply to this review and inform me just what in the hell was is going on in this strange mystical canyon bottom that would be terrific no spoilers here but from what i could gather some archeologists find some cave paintings and link every cave painting ever discovered to this strange mystical planet with the canyon bottom it seems odd right off the bat because the paintings and or etchings are just stick figures any mongoloid would draw pointing to the sky with a couple of circles that i suppose represent this moon planet this is where civilization started but the creators arent very nice and from what i could gather they have created so many terrifying species that nobody can keep track of them all you have worms snakes lizards guys who look like the character powder squids and zombies theres horrifying black ink eggs that glow mosaics that morph hollow structures with scary crazy horse size skulls carved into them decapitated bodies and epic dust storms i think ridley scott wants us to think that the creators are on a plot to destroy mankind and this must be the case because the pretty archeologist says so even though she just went through an incredible surgery on her abdomen shes a quick healer folks its really a complete and total mess and it was difficult for this viewer to truly know exactly what was going on because there are so many different creatures alien forms to keep track of the zombie bit didnt make a lick of sense to me and i was just hopin charlize theron would just torch everyone including herself the crew and myself but at least she got run over by a spaceship i mean man man i im trying to remember a collection of dumber characters assembled in one film these top of the line scientists embark on a field trip of the dumbest decision making ever captured on film and its hard to even attempt to enjoy a movie story when there is so much cerebral floundering taking place at least the majority of them get killed i guess sometimes the dumb really deserve that i mean when your dumb as hell neighbor has his garbage disposal running and drops two kernels of orville redenbachers into it and then thrusts his arm down there do you really feel sorry for him of course you dont dont pretend that you do adding insult to injury the android in the movie looks like michael score from a flock of seagulls i kept waiting for him to pull his keyboard out and start rotating around the spaceship set piece made of aluminum foil just really disappointing and really truly awful no true redeeming qualities to it at all and the very ending made me barf in complete disgust 
this is not a review of the dvd im sure it is quite delightful however the movie sucked ill give it star because of special effect not because they were good fx just because they had some fyi you cant give stars as other reviews have noted there isnt any science in their fiction the tie in to the alien movie s is really weak what really bugged me was when the girl that did a caesarian to extract the alien and then hops off the table and runs down the hall i took my wife hours before she could stand up i really laughed my a off of this i guess the script for this movie must have taken say minutes to write it is obviously totally derivative of aliens with more special effects less story same spaceship on dubious company business same robot as key perpetrator of said company business same deserted planet same dormant aliens waiting for dumb earthlings same plans to decimate earth same baseball cap to prepare for the ultimate heroic sacrifice big change this time is that the spaceship lands in a direct line to the buried spaceships aliens via a conveniently built road the actors are a very mixed bag noomi rapace is hard to reconcile as the mesmeric energetic lead in the girl with the dragon tattoo her acting in prometheus is wooden to the nth degree and her facial features are reminiscent of someone post root canal the novocain look and her hair how the remaining actors were able keep a straight face throughout is a mystery and she was ready to jump into bed with the first bbmf utter drivel with sub themes of religion and immortality oh and the master race ive seen tom and jerry cartoons that have better and more logical dialog and by that yardstick homer simpson is a thoughtful genius this movie is yet another sign of the decline of western culture aided and abetted by hollywood greed the visual effects were stunning in blu ray but the story went nowhere pointless is one descriptive word that springs to mind another is contrived the prometheus plot is what i would expect from a low budget horror movie this one just has better special effects perhaps the disappointment that the movie ended before the story was over stems from a less than subtle attempt to set the stage for a sequel if that is the case the effective cost of this entertainment is at least double not an acceptable proposition a movie must stand on its own or be marketed as a series i could not identify with any of the characters perhaps it is too much of a stretch to believe that all the highly trained and carefully selected scientists and crew would act like incompetent fools they seemed bent on their own destruction without any rhyme or reason 
i was really looking forward to this one i have been an aliens and predator fan since the beginning im just gonna pretend this one doesnt exist 
the story itself is horribly ridiculous even within its own world of contrivances i am still stunned that absolutely every aspect of the story is so groaningly eye rollingly ridiculous the acting is good but marred by the awful story and dialog the special effects are good but are also marred by the awful story i however can not say that the direction is good because a good director would have changed e v e r y t h i n g yes even ridley scott can make stinkers and this one isnt his first basically without a good story you have nothing but well done crap running around in a ridiculous plot saying and doing ridiculous things and thats exactly what we have here 
some movies just should never be made this is one of them this movie stands on the promise of awsome trailers which by itself should indicate that it would not be worth it as now a days trailers actually are much better to watch than the movie that often dont even include the scenes in the trailer or the scenes are so far apart that they convey a different message when they are packed together in the trailer than they would have in their movie positions and the hint of alien influences both of which are let down by the movie there was no suspense driven by any of the potentially creepy scenes this is clearly an establishment movie that extends future installments a possibility to become better but clearly they are seriously lacking in many areas by the way the inclusion of a chrisian believer in the movie the woman with the cross shows just how lacking in understanding of religion that exists in the holywoodites these days in there full tilt effort to become anti religion they often show a false faith ideology in their depictions it would have been better had they made up a religious symbol that had no connection with any modern day religions cause ridley scott demonstrated just how bad things have become these days even frank herbert of dune did better at building the religious mythos around the pre existing ideology oh yeah he was a novelist and not a holywood type movie maker who are used to producing top billed b moviesi rate this movie in the mid b range as to those seeking to buy save your money and wait for wal mart to include it in their misc movie box 
its difficult to understand how such an ill conceived film got funded one can only assume the producers figured fans of the frist two alien films would line up for a prequel that answered the questions those films raised had i been the reader i would have sent back the script with try again a lot harder scribbled on the cover i expected a film with profound insights into life the universe and everything what i got was a story that for the first minutes rehashed alien the voyagers do all the stupid things the people in the first film do with minor variations when we finally start getting answers to our questions they turn out not to be particularly surprising or deep and at least one major issue isnt properly addressed or resolved the following is from the wikipedia article according to scott although the film shares strands of aliens dna so to speak and takes place in the same universe prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas most viewers are likely to strongly disagree especially as the first film had no particular mythology or any idea other than to scare the crap out of the audience which it did very well the script is mechanical sloppy and thin especially in the dialog department unlike the first two films which focus tightly on the characters and their predicament prometheus has unnecessary scenes and slack pointless dialog i was particularly annoyed by the scenes in which janek asks vickers if shes interested in hanky panky and vickers stating that weyland is her father when their actions up to that point make that clear ridley scotts direction is no more than competent though the general lack of tension might be partly due to our familiarity with the material its hard to believe prometheus was directed by the man who helmed alien and blade runner the only sequence that doesnt come across as wholly mechanical is shaws using a computer controlled surgery machine to perform a caesarian but its so over the top that its hard to believe as is shaws ability to be up and around right after a major disappointment from a director who seems to have been asleep at the wheel 
if you once loved ridley scott because of the original alien movie and for some unknown reason havent seen this film yet run for the hills even if youve never seen this film or heard of alien run for the hills where the first film set the bar for later sci fi films this film is an epic failure and is utterly forgettable how a director of scotts stature could not see that this movie script had no plot and barely developed any of its characters and therefore was doomed to flop is a bigger mystery than the mystery the film claims to solve charlize theron serves only as eye candy what was she thinking to take this role and noomi rapaces talents are abominably wasted despite all the hype this film has nothing to do with the great original alien movie and does not compare because it does everything wrong that the first film did right alien is a movie where all the elements cohere are expertly edited and serve a purpose here the bloated cast doesnt know what to do since i cant rate it lower i give it one star for the pure visual pretension of the film 
watch only if youre a die hard brad pitt fan this movie has every cliche in horror history i believe there is a great youtube video that shows the top things wrong this this movie however is a lower number than i would give it i could name roughly got money to burn and want to watch something that doesnt involve your higher brain functions by all means proceed my friend 
for the millions that loved the photographic greatness of inception this movie will hold their interest inceptioin had a thin storyline undefendable plot and was a mix of spies like us snow mobiles scenes off shore abandoned drilling rigs supposedly part of a dream and a virus that could have been abandoned in lieu of hypnosis to accomplish the same purpose stated in the movie world war z has inexplicable explosions car overturns contact lenses on characters who suddenly develop bad teeth while the zonbies are cable of catching numerous adults the main character and his wife outrun them accompanied by three children photographs in an elevator are supposed to be frightening and arent the blame is placed on a virus that kills most and after injecting oneself with a deadly toxin the zombies cant smell their victim though earlier they found their victime by sound come on you can come up with a better story 
to me the movie suck brad pitt have made better movie then this one there been other movie of this story that better but my boyfriend love this movie 
i could have also done the world war zzzzzz but i am sure thats been done to death there are a few action elements of this film that make it interesting and none of the performances are terrible but it is ultimately a feeble derivative and repetitive film when the same exact scenario repeats it self times in a film its hard to get a new reaction there are too many moments where suspension of disbelief depends entirely on ignoring any semblance of real world behavior or logic predictable and ultimately uninterestingthe movie is so lazy it left me with little energy to give it a more in depth review 
what a joke some actor should just never try to become directors and brad pitt is definitely one of them the plot is a joke the characters are a joke and the world is saved by the un lmao hes been for too long with angelina maybe he just needed money and maybe he got some funds from his un friends to make them look like heroes in this really really bad movie 
i just couldnt stand watching anymore after seeing the first hour and that only because i wanted to see why brad pitt and david morse two of my favorite actors would choose to be in a zombie movie morses acting during that first sequence was fabulous pitt well hes okay but the role he had was just move move move very little dialogue filmography stars directing and film editing stars see next paragraph special effects stars less for the zombies screenplay stars no character development so no empathy with the characters and film premise of zombie infection stars sound stars either too loud or too quiet and puleese someone remember that most folks will be watching this on monitors or lcd led tvs so dont shoot everything so dark we cant see whats going on movie opening didnt allow audience to get comfortably empathetic too fast its like the opening episode of falling skies which was also all movement idea to make you experience the thing but puleese directors give us characters we attach to first before laying on all that action which no one can follow this thing could have been so much better with a different premise and better screenplay which actually had a plot you could get into the slight sotto voce idea that israel got protected first could have been done better and came off instead as either a cheap insult or a cheap miracle not even worth finishing but ill force myself since must attend computer registry cleaning then will come back and re rate if required believe it or not theyre making a sequel so there must be a lot of zombies who liked the first one edit finally finished watching didnt reword the assessment above the last half was hoakey half baked full of discontinuity rushed cant believe they spent million to make this picture again the filmography and editing were quality enough but the content was just plain awful and of course the premise is so dumb it demeans everyone associated with the film but it broke even at the box office so the dummies are making a sequel which ill never watch once was enough even while cleaning my computer 
turned it off and didnt watch the whole thing
i cant believe brad pitt would waste his time with this movie gory stomach churning soul sickening movie what r we becoming to make watch or participate in the sales of this crap 
for a brad pitt movie i was really disappointed the plot in this movie seem to lag i am glad i did not pay big bucks to see this in the theater
this had the potential of being a good movie but for a movie about zombies you would expect to see zombies do not waist your money stay home and watch the walking dead 
kinda dumb more dropping and convulsing bodies than thoughts going on in this flick somewhat like a picture book of zombie like terror 
holy bejeezus is this a spectacularly bad film i dont even know where to begin my wife and i just sat there in comically stunned disbelief at the end of the film horrible in every way a movie can be 
i cant believe brad pitt would be associated w a film this bad the zombie thing is generally overdone to begin with and this offered nothing new to the genre in fact it wasnt well done for the genre it flat out didnt make sense 
if you need to waste a good number of minutes out of your life this movie is for you apparently brad needed to get away from the wide and kids so he took this project on as a sort of vacation its just too bad it doesnt really deliver anything except zombies it starts right out with zombies created by some strange but really undefined whatever minutes after this movie starts you hit with death destruction mayhem it continues all through the movie and did i forget zombies they flow like water all through this movie the only part that may take your concern is when brad has a brush with a zombie well youre waiting for him to turn or whatever the ending well if you made it this far then maybe you should watch it to find out for yourself this was an overdone poor storyline no story action shoot zombies and thats about it the overall development looks like something a high school cinema class could put together and frankly i believe they could do a better job really take a drive go out to dinner or take a walk in the park as it would be a better way to spend the minutes your going to waste on viewing this zombie movie 
horrible no story no plot it may be the worst movie of the year simply a waste of bandwidth luckily i saw it on prime and it was free i got what i paid for 
even brad pitt couldnt save this noisy incoherent no story bomb to criticize this things script gives the word script a very bad name hint there is no script if you want to melt through several years accumulation of ear wax just listen to this bombastic soundtrack if you want to really experience morning sickness men take note the several hundred jump cuts per scene ought to do the trick i admit one persons drek may be anothers pablum but with all due respect i gladly pass the spoon 
if you like zombies and can ignore the obvious bad science then you might like it i did not and just watched the beginning and could see where it was going 
word war z starts with a sort of novel approach to the zombie thing but it never develops into a good story its a zombie movie so we expect some chasing and chewing but endless combat scenes overwhelm a potentially interesting story line and any acting talent brad pitt might lend to the movie the cause is revealed too fast and the solution too quick and simple with the rest of the moving given to action scenes this would have been an ok saturday night scifi channel tv movie but for a big screen production with brad pitt in the lead it was a total disappointment if you are doing a dissertation on the history of zombie movies i guess you will have to watch it otherwise just go for a rerun episode of walking dead 
i have no idea who the audience is for this movie but i thought it was a total waste of time 
another walking dead type movie slow and silly unless you have a great imagination this move could not hold my interest 
this is appropriately rated with the name of the lead actor the pitt s a sketchy plot no scientific plausibility at all which is the hallmark of good science fiction and pretty much a venue for computer graphics geeks to create scenes with thousands of these zombie thingies climbing walls throwing themselves off ledges crashing into windshields well you get the drift im surprised what a star at the level of brad pitt saw in this script since it certainly didnt challenge his formidable talent and another thing where do i get one of those aircraft he flew all over h l and back with apparently only one brief refueling and the thing actually launched from an aircraft carrier shoo ie i gotta git me one of those 
cannot believe brad pitt chose to be in such a loser movie disjointed shaky too much blah blah do not recommend it to anyone 
world war z brad pitt sleeps through this flat movie pg horror at its worst his hair was nice in a movie where he travels the world in attempt to convince people to die instead of him then he has a tender make out moment with a zombie dressed in his finest duck tape and magazines for an anti climatic finale the true message of the film the loss of print media will be the first step to the zombie apocalypse majorly riffable fun 
the trailers looked good so i thought this would be a really interesting movie even based on some sort of pandemic brad pitt is a good draw so i thought this might be good within the first mins i knew i was watching another stupid dumb zombie movie i cannot believe brad pitt succumed to playing a role in this movie woody harrelson in zombieland was at least somewhat predictable but this just sucked i wasted on this one 
stupid gruesome show and cant believe bratt pitt was in such a lame movie not a movie for younger kids or for any one 
yow zombies a special effects team drama and still this movie will not gel a classic example of how money big names slick production values and too many cooks can still f up a simple recipe this movie made a better theater trailer than a full screen epic disaster film so dont invest your time unless you plan to take a shower at the end of this one to get da stink off 
most zombie movies stink to begin with but this one had an aroma that make you want to run screaming for wasting and hours of your time sorry brad like your other work but this one stunk 
horrible boring poor plot id rather watch reruns of the walking dead on netflix for some really good zompocalypse action 
i love zombies nothing better than the walking dead right now i was so excited to see this movie first i bought the book and that was a huge disappointment movie and book are really different i should have known that when i hated the book the movie was going to be bad too and it was watching the movie and not reading the book you had little idea of what brads character in the movie did they really didnt go into his background the zombies were sort of cool but they moved so fast in the movie you really didnt get to enjoy them as in the walking dead i felt this was a waste of time and i would not recommend to zombie lovers 
cant believe pitt was a party to this curiosity got the best of my husband well hes paying for it 
i didnt like it at all brad pitt looked old and the zombies were gross and stupid book was soo much better how could they get it so bad
let me make this as simple as the movie is pros interesting twist on a zombie outbreak and cure good variety cast interesting conspiracy that the government received notice of a zombie without informing the nation world lots of action if you don t care how the action is delivered cons another book ruined odd cgi zombies ruined this movie for me unrealistic approach of zombies having super speed and turning into acrobats unrealistic that in a plane crash the main character and others happen to be the only ones to survive convenient no true character development
i saw it in the theater second day of its release in d and being a brad pitt fan was absolutely horrified and not in a good way by this nonsense and yet i cant help noticing a lot of star reviews almost as if its being seeded by the studio for a movie that has no characters none of the traditional zombie violence theres a lot of shrieking and running but nothing remotely approaching graphic and not a single head shot which is how you kill zombies isnt it and a story that is just silly the camera does a lot of flash panning and blurring so its almost impossible to tell what is happening which is probably for the best because the director doesnt seem to have any interest in the story anyway every sequence in this film from the very beginning where pitt and family have breakfast devolves into a tedious clich eacute the acting is pedestrian at best pitts two cute daughters are annoying enough that i actually found myself wishing theyd get eaten every scene feels contrived and often like a cut and paste from another movie which i suspect most of them are the zombies are those high speed dudes from days later now that is a zombie movie and they make a lot of noise and shriek but someone decided to trim or not even shoot any kind of carnage so while there are some spectacular crowd scenes youve seen most of them in the trailer btw there isnt any visceral threat little tension and no horror to speak of the film makes the classic mistake that most hollywood groupthink projects make disrespecting the genre in night of the living dead the dead rose and feasted on the living and no one wasted time trying to figure out why in days later a virus got loose and the infected feasted on the flesh of the living and no one wondered why in zac snyders silly remake of dawn of the dead one of the characters died and then it was revealed that if youre not bitten you dont come back so where did the first zombie come from hint it didnt matter until the idiot screen writer brought it up wwz has brad pitt on a quest for patient zero a la contagion a great apocalyptic movie btw so they can do what find a cure you turn zombie ten seconds find a vaccine they bite you its like creating a vaccine for shark bite by the time pitt arrives at the final act you can anticipate the dialog word for word and then it all turns into a doom like videogame but wait maybe i was just jaded with ridiculous expectations i felt so bad about feeling bad about this movie that i rented mama just to see if i was having a bad day mama scared the pants off me wwz forget it this is the zombie movie you can take your parents to and then you can listen to them listen to them call you a wuss all the way home 
just what the world needs viral based zombie war movie i spent either or i forget on this movie and i still feel like i was ripped off brad pitt you are capable of much more substantial roles than this lame o storyline stereotypical zombie noises colossal waste of production money better to have given the millions spent on this movie to the real residents of jerusalem who have experienced such horrible warring and poverty everyone involved in this movie should have their heads examined 
what a terrible movie not even brad pitt can turn this sows ear into a silk purse for a decent sci fi flick check out cowboys an aliens 
within minutes of the opening scene our expert protagonist with years of experience in nato conflict zones has escaped a crowded city in chaos then takes his entire family into a store being looted by a mob then allows them to split up the movie hadnt even started and i had stopped believing in the characters and the drama that was being so poorly constructed this film brings nothing new to the zombie genre lazy cliches include build tension in a scene with a car rv that wont start and the good ol we must be very quiet but i forgot to turn off the ringer on my mobile satellite phone so lazy so uncreative so many ways to do these things right im embarrassed for the film makers i hope the guys made them do it if anyone made on this stinker i hope they turn around and do some good projects with it brad 
save your attention for something better and less formulaic 
total waste of time and rental money absolutely boring non sensible a world war started by rabid individuals dont think so 
to be fair i only made it through about minutes there did not seem to be a story beyond how many ways can this family be traumatized if you like action only and nothing else it might be ok 
the good thing is that the bluray audio and video were fine lots of surround action looking behind me for those helicopters for example room shaking explosions clear dialog as for everything else wasnt worth the money after all of the good stuff brad pitt did how did he wind up doing this movie i should have known better than to expect a super hyped up on tv movie to live up to its ads it was eagerly awaited but i wont even bother watching the d version maybe the movie was ok if you are a zombie fanatic i am not the zombies were pretty scary but ill take any and all of the resident evil movies over this one try renting it or viewing it on line before you buy it 
this is the stupidest zombie movie ever and not in fun way it tries to make a point about the un politics in zombie movie no thanks mr pitt really is not a very compelling actor in my opinion no serious issues in a zombie movie what next a romcom about starvation and drought 
the movie was a big disappointment it was dull and boring with few suspenseful moments the action and dialogue were predictable i would not recommend this to anyone not even brad pitt could save it 
if i had fully realized when i turned this clunker on that it was a zombie movie i would have found something else as a fantasy movie with big star names and a lot of very glitzie computer generated aspects scenes and features i suppose this isnt terrible the dialog is reasonable but most of the characters with speaking parts of some sort dont really show the kind of stress that the tale of zombie hordes should have evoked this is an excellent movie of its genre suitable for eight or nine year olds who like scary movies or perhaps those adults who suffer from severe intellectual and emotional development issues who believe that this sort of fantasy garbage could actually take place after thinking about it for a while i have decided the only really good thing about this movie was that brad pitt probably got paid more than union scale 
not really worth wasting hours on didnt move very quick and the plot was questionable really surprised brad pitt would take this kind of risk 
flat predictable plot with no real surprises the potential was there but it is never reached i was deeply disappointed with the whole experience 
after seeing the trailer for this movie i could hardly wait to get it well the wait is over and boy was i completely and totally disappointed in this hour trip to no where if you want to see a bunch of running zombies getting shot in the head over and over and over again from all angles then this is the movie for you but if you like movies with suspense and a script that makes sense and characters you can get to know and oh i dont know maybe substance and entertainment then this is one of those movies you can just pass up and forget about first thing i did after i finished watching this was to give the dvd away to someone i know who collects movies for the sake of collecting i didnt even want this one taking up room on my shelf too bad because it looks so darn good in the trailer 
man was this a poor film poor plot poor acting poor direction almost unable to watch the whole thing want a great zombie story walking dead season one no one including romero has ever done a better one 
a zombie movie that is bad in so many ways if brad pitt wasnt in this it would have been a miserable flop with brad pitt in this its still a miserable flop avoid at all costs 
stupid stupid stupid how in the hell can everything go wrong then right on when the going gets tough i know its a movie but come on dont waste your time even if you area brad pitt fan horrible flick i heard it got delayed in the release to rewrite the end the studio should have rewrote the whole story 
i love zombies i was so excited that i could rent this and not have to sit in a packed theater was i ever disappointed minutes into the movie i turned it off it was b o r i n g and not at all what i expected the only plus was that while seemed too much but at least i didnt spend on a movie ticket 
the ultimate success of this genre depends on the viewers willing suspension of disbelief very hard to do when zombies take over the world at light speed the entire city of ny ny falls in about a half hour yet brad pitt and his family manage to escape a former un envoy brad pitt is portrayed as a james bond like character that the us military the israeli government and the cia come to for answers not the un from real life israel is able to keep the zombies out by building a ft plus ft high wall around their entire country then the zombies climb up on each other to form a human mountain of undead flesh and scale the wall pitts wife call him on an iridium phone while he is in south korea investigating the source of the zombie outbreak and while he is surrounded by zombies just waiting to take him down the call is so he can say goodnight to his kids pitt narrowly escapes several of his comrades are bitten and become zombies all thanks to his wifes naivety and pitt doesnt even bother to tell his wife not to call him again while he is involved in operations i could go on and on if you want pulp action and are a fan of zombie movies then by all means watch this dont expect to laugh cry or feel like you are there however as someone who both loves action sci fi but also realizes a well done movie may be done by artistically representing something like an old man fishing from a boat and nothing more as in hemmingways old man and the sea i have to say this movie is not well done on either end of the spectrum i stopped watching it after minutes something i only do about once every years or so 
this movie is super predictable it has all of the worst zombie movie tropes and doesnt do anything new or original 
it would have been a better movie by leaps and bounds if the kids had died as it stands im angry they arent dead they deserved to die it also would have given brad pitts character some motivation for oh i dont know anything he does in this schlockfest 
this thing is a b minus movie the only reason i watched it was because it starred brad pitt looks like the movie was based on hiring a name brand lead actor then hoping for the best 
seriously this movie had some major dead spots minutes could have been trimmed off this movie and it would have improved my opinion big time as always dezel washingtons acting was spot on as i could not stand his character in this movie but it just dragged on and on so to cut this short the good great actingthe bad way too many dragging moments in this film and the whole grimy feel of it was not pleasing overall did not care for it 
this film was a huge disappointment to this viewer it caused a type of mental claustrophobia wherein this segment of the pilots life was like looking through a keyhole instead of through a window it was not a broad enough storyline to place in some sort of context whether or not that was the intent of identifying the process of addiction or not it made for a grim movie start to finish the acting was okay but story so narrow that there wasnt much room for a more multi layered character piece goodmans overt over the topness was just plain getting on your nervesness denzels twitches and stumbles were not believable all in all i was not convinced or engaged just couldnt wait for it to be over both the story and the screenwriting still needed a lot of work 
the dvd cover quotes time as saying flight soars i would change that to say snores the start of the movie is entertaining but after the plane crashes just turn the movie off the majority of the film is slow paced and very boring i had as much reason to root for the main character as i would for any other random drunk driver if you want a fun denzel man vs transportation movie watch unstoppable instead 
it seemed like a long aa advertisement this movie is not really about a plane flight but about a persons flight from crashing in drugs to recovery and it does not really go in depth with the character just a lot of bad scenes showing abuse so not much of a story the star for dw bringing something to the show i would not bother watching this i guess i felt it was a disappointment because i was expecting a movie about a plane pilot and court drama and it does not 
having worked for the airlines for about years i can tell you that flight is a terrible movie laughable in spots and just plain dumb this is pure hollywood fantasy commercial airplanes ie s or md s do not fly inverted ridiculous pilot unions do not enable drunk pilots house them or pay for their highs airline ceos fire drunk pilots faster than a jet at vr if anyone suspects a pilot or any crew member of drinking during the hour bottle to throttle rule every time they land or even prior to take off theyll either pee in the cup or blow in the tube once you are under an ntsb investigation you are literally locked away until they finish their questions the faa in a situation like this is your worst enemy and where were they in this movie if this guy is a drunk pilot who killed people its federal so the fbi gets involved too drug dealers do not have access to people under investigation in hospital rooms ntsb hearings are federal hearings there are no objections during hearings especially by the pilot union a lawyer can not get information disqualified totally stupid inaccurate and typical hollywood nonsense who ever wrote this clap trap next time write about what you know its bad dumb and totally inaccurate movie even the tower guys sounded like actors this movie was so bad i had to force myself to watch it to the end a rent thank heavens 
what ever happen to the real denzel i see why his wife did not care for this i want my money and time back i purchased this movie thinking it was going to be a thriller mystery which the back states nail biting thriller no way i would rather watch scooby doo the nude scene was pure trash and uncalled for there was no need to have a scene so distasteful there was no need for the all the bad language over kill on the drugs and alcohol use story line plot the dots did not connect yes pilots who drink are a problem but i would rather see a solution focused movie on how to solve that problem than one that shows the nude drug etc pilots drinking and using drugs is a real problem and this happens in real life nothing to play with addiction is real and nothing to play with yes this shows what an addict looks like goes through etc however i would have rather have seen something more tasteful denzel performance was great as usual which is the reason we purchased the movie as it has a great cast i tried to give this movie to a family member and they told me no thanks denzel is one of my favorite actors and we own most of his movies we liked him in out of time unstoppable the good movies denzel dont lower your standards for a movie roll you are top quality keep it that way this was way different we understand the addiction but the nude scene was distasteful keep it classy and not trashy would not want to leave a movie like this behind for generations to see legacy is everything we should have purchased taken skyfall avengers etc yes the movie has rated r on the back many movies do but the content is not like this keep your money this movie is not worth renting or streaming either 
if the studio had actually been honest with what this movie was about i wouldnt have wasted my money thriller mystery who actually landed the plane the only thing this movie had was good acting by mr washington but other than that i would much rather see a movie about people with high ethics and moral standards not sure any were introduced here might have missed it but im not going to watch it again to try to pick out one decent human being 
the action sequence in the beginning of this film is incredible the dw charachter is the most capable i have ever seen in an impossible circumstance and despite the fact that he is drunk and on coke the rest of the film sees him in a self destructive alcohalic arrogant stuper hes eventially set up to get off scott free and be called a hero and then confesses for a non reason maybe its ten percent terrific then ninety percent depressing and stupid please dont let me spoil it for you unless of course youd prefer to watch something worthwhile 
given the flight heroics of denzel are utterly ridiculous there is in fact no basis for developing any feelings for his fatally flawed character 
this movie is a waste of time unecessary sex scenes not much interest at all one interesting scene and that was the actual problem with flight then he lands a plane that he flies upside down really now i am tired of movies with sex in them and nudity if i try to watch a movie at home and have kids or friends over i have to shut it off and it bothers me to have to sit thru it producers should make better movies now a days they all seem like a year old boy made the movie 
the movie is really about this guys drinking and denial problems not about the flight or the subsequent investigation i thought the trailer was misleading 
it was very disappointing because it had too much unnecessary nudity and the storyline dragged halfway through the movie sadly this movie is not worth watching 
the previews looked great i am a huge denzel washington fan but i have to say this was a huge disappointment it dragged on the plot involving the woman was needless and i found myself wanting the movie to end i would not recommend this unless it was for rent at but for i wish i would have spent it on something else 
scarcely made it five minutes into this flick it opens right up with a nude scene hello hit the off button who knows where this film could go from this crass and pointless beginning it is indeed unfortunate that hollywood chooses to titillate instead of producing thought provoking life stories of redeeming value 
we didnt even bother watching the whole movie i tried watching it with my family and the first thing they show as soon as the movie starts a completely naked women completely come on what am i watching porn cant a family sit down and enjoy a movie of suspense action without there being total nudity apparently not so thats why i gave it star
i was completely unprepared for how bad the characters were in this movie i ended up fast forwarding through the opening scenes hoping it would improve but by the third or fourth encounter with what were truly pitiful characters id had enough not my kind of movie thats for sure if you like a story that opens with titties drug addicts and alcoholics go for it really bad movie imo ever since training day ive had enough of densel never again his choice in character roles sucks big time buh bye update so i tried to watch this again now that its available as an amazon prime movie and i stand by my original review i just could not get into this story at all my apologies to denzel you are too good an actor to do this kind of crap i absolutely loved the book of eli best movie youve ever done so its not you its your seemingly many bad choices in movie material 
i couldnt watch the whole thing i got to the part where denzel is in the hospital and skipped to the end what was with the gratuitous nudity at the beginning why is an actor with denzels status doing a scene like that and why are they degrading this actress it wasnt just the nudity it was shot deliberately for the erotic value and totally exploitive more exploitive than some scenes ive seen in movies in which there was more sexual content anyway another lame excuse of an ad for step programs for alchoholics the same old tired and shaming blaming idea that the alchoholic has to hit bottom yada yada all the while the sucess rate of aa is shockingly low and many of its ideas harmful particularly to those who have endured any kind of abuse for some people it works but cmon stop showing these idealized everything is great now easy outcomes you know the old its all my fault and im a bad person but now im in aa and my life is so great cliches apart from all that and the ridiculous symbolism of the plane chopping off the church steeple the movie is just pretty bad overall denzel does a fine job acting but everything else needed a lot of work the only engaging part of the movie was the actual flight and crash what a waste of time 
ok movie best part was the airline crash on your seat suspense the acting was over the top rating this only one star because the director and productor used the olded cliche in the book the perry mason defense where the person on trial stands up at the last minute and confesses this crappy ending has been the part of the movies for years and is is stupid was hoping that the writers would be smart enought to figure some other way of ending but it looks like they just reused the same old legal drama that nobody in their right mind would find convincing
everybody is oohing and aahing over the magic of disney and the wonder of imagination alive in this movie give me a break these reviewers are under some kind of spell yes but im not so sure that spell was not prescribed heres what you get the animation is perfect yes the magic sometimes fun to watch but the story is a ho hum trip through mediocrity the characters are stock personalities youve seen a hundred times before and the dialogue is bland so why a one because they never shut up what do you mean they never stop singing imagine the little mermaid but ariel is having a bipolar episode imagine the lion king but the animals never stop singing hakuna matata imagine toy story but in each scene woody and buzz do show tunes this is a a self important annoying musical if they had focused on story more than crooning maybe we would have a classic on our hands but this is an over hyped wasted opportunity if you love musicals then i have to recommend it if you want to be entertained and enter the end credits without a headache look elsewhere 
this is a put your mind in neutral and enjoy the movie snacks movie if you know anything about physics this movie will drive you nuts with the implausible situations that are depicted from the start to the end of the movie the complete opening of the movie is implausible the colliding satellites arent in the same orbital altitude as the space station the astronauts would have hours days or weeks notice the dibris would reach them all sorts of solutions could be employed to keep the astronauts safe the plot would have collapsed right there the physics of bodies in space acted on by external forces dont behave as depicted in the movie in almost every case the psychology of the astronauts werent very realistic either people wont make it to astronaut statust if they cant remain calm and sort through multiple life and death technical problems before they ever go to space as smart as sandra bullocks character might have been there would be little to no liklihood that she could reprogram a russian spacecrafts system to make it into a lifeboat the cgi is spectacular but the director should have budgeted funds for some technical experts to guide the movie such that the foolish storyline could have been avoided my impression is the director didnt likebeing told his storyline was juvenile and stubbornly was going to make the movie his way this is a dollar movie dont waste your money on buying a copy of it it could have been a really great movie what a shame to waste tge talent of so many people 
this is one of those movies that people either hate or love i fast forwarded through so much of the movie that i ended up simply deleting it not for me 
everyone raved about this movie and insisted i watch it i could have gone on with my life if i hadnt while it is an interesting thought on how a person may survive an event like that in space i had a hard time watching the whole movie because there wasnt really much to it other than avoid this and get to that spot 
i saw this last night my jaw dropped it is the most overrated movie in ages clearly the people who loved it saw it in imax d because it falls apart completely on regular tv theres no there there its supposed to be a realistic space thriller but there are more scientific errors than a star wars movie then when the flaws are pointed out everyones like its only a movie so what is it a realistic space thriller or only a movie their heads are so clearing added to computer animated space suits the characters are all unappealing clooneys character is obnoxious bullocks is idiotic at first and then frustrating an hour of sandra bullock hyperventilating gloved hands flapping around like flippers not grabbing tethers i didnt care if any of them lived or died i just wanted it to end im loving the public backlash here on amazon this movie is the most overrated movie since the sixth sense as far as im concerned and hardly worth its oscar nominations 
ridley scott on meth a completely implausible piece of space junk how it got nominated for best pic is totally beyond me and i love a good sic fi ripping tale spoiler alert when the ghost of clooney appears to ryan as shes about to end it all because of her dead year old and tells her to put her feet on the ground and start living for tomorrow my gag reflex kicked in 
a waste of time and money dont bother a real disappointment for me after all is said and done i dont know why they made this movie i know there are concerns about the impact space junk has on the space program but what does that have to do with making an entertaining movie if they wanted to make a point about space junk then make a documentary for broadcast on pbs 
a modern movie with no soul no one you really care about hugely over hyped special effects dont mean a thing when there is no plot boring and a huge waste of money 
this is an absurdly over rated maudlin excuse for a space soap opera horrible terrible hackneyed dialogue with a self sacrificing i will die so that you may live for the memory of your dead child hero in george clooney he was better off mugging and acting goofy in his other comedies an astronaut obsessed with c w well that is certainly original and innovative even the special effects are nothing impressive sorry we paid to rent it we would have quit after ten minutes if it had been free 
special effects are great but there needs to be a story this movie didnt have a compelling well told story and even the special effects were not that special an obvious way for clooney and bullock to make some quick money and keep their name in the lights where did they get that mission control narrator please send him back to the radio station in oklahoma where they found him he was downright annoying no one i know thought this was a very good movie 
it is just a very very bad movie i saw it in a plane going to japan i knew it will be bad clooney and bullock lol what a great choice completely unrealistic this is so laughable it make me thing that alfonso cuar oacute n has no clue about space science i am sure nasa community had a good laugh at this movie but hollywood love to produce movie for iq star for the computer generated graphics
i love sandra bullock seriously i think mr clooney also is a good actor however neither acting abilities nor media hype can salvage what is ultimately a huge steaming pile of crap unrealistic not that this trait in itself is a killer superman isnt exactly realistic but its a great success but this story does not try to be super natural it tries to be realistic and it so grossly does not succeed than it warrants everyone involved being kicked in the nuts including those who do not have them kick kick kick thanks for nothing creators of this garbage 
everything everything that can go wrong in minutes in space goes wrong during this movie there is no plot apart from this we just progress from thing goes wrong a to thing goes wrong z at breakneck speed with some cheesy lines thrown in which bottoms out when sandra bullock starts howling plaintively to a radio broadcast of a dog while george clooney plays every character he has played ever but this time wearing a space suit the special effects are good and the sense of terror of the situation comes through but apart from that there is no substance to this movie at all if the directors had slowed it down a little they may have built a bit more credibility into the plot but as it was when the surviving astronaut finally surfaces from the ocean at the end of the movie i fully expected to see a sharks fin headed towards her if you are looking for anything vaguely intelligent look elsewhere this movie has no brain at all having said that for what it is gravity is not bad a pretty distraction but a memorable piece of cinema no way 
it is true it is visually beautiful i bought this movie at sams because i wanted to see this before the oscars well i was really disappointed the movie is terrible if you watched the previews that is the whole movie there is no substance to this movie maybe they are going for the picture quality but surely nothing else sorry but it is true i love sandra bullock bit this is not one of her finest moments nor george c either and i have loved practically all their movies 
this was a nothing movie it was very boring and impossible to connect to the actors 
no spoiler guaranteethis is a survival movie you know that in the first minutes when only clooney and bullock are left alive i was so sure that we would enjoy this movie being a fan of both clooney and bullock who isnt that i did not mind actually buying the movie through amazon when the rental was not available but i was wincing in pain most of the movie i certainly wanted bullock to survive but she is panicky and whining through most of the movie this seems a great insult to female astronauts and the nasa training program there is no sign of the stoic houston we have a problem clooney remains calm in a han solo grinning way which only adds to the insult to women bullock is allowed to panic and cry and freeze up in a way that would be completely unacceptable for a male astronaut sure bullock is supposed to be the scientist but do you think female scientists are incapable of staying calm under pressure and following their training in a movie asserting itself to be so realistic this seems fatally unrealistic we see more bravery from bullock as an average citizen in the movie speed good movie the next fatal flaw is in how they eliminate clooney this movie tries so hard to be realistic that it eliminates sound in all the space crashing scenes which of course is correct because space cannot transmit sound but this lack of sound reduces the drama then in one of the most pivotal scenes bullock holds onto clooney who was drifting away with a cord the drift not a fall is arrested at the last minute but clooney exclaims that the cord will not hold hold what the momentum that he had was stopped there is no force pulling on him at this point well actually there is gravity but the way gravity would work in space would be to pull him slightly toward bullock and the rest of the debris instead the movie plays it like two rock climbers on one rope and the guy at the bottom cuts the cord to save the other see day after tomorrow or vertical limit both excellent movies so they wanted to create a situation where bullock would be left alone but this situation is contrived in a way that suggest the characters and the movie makers no nothing about gravity other annoying mistakes is that bullock would not know that when she uses the fire extinguisher that there would be an equal and opposite reaction sending her flying and almost killing herself this is used as foreshadowing where she takes this knowledge to use the extinguisher to fly her to safety but are we expected to believe that she never received training on how a fire extinguisher works in space she make several of these kinds of mistakes which suggest she is either the worst astronaut in history or that nasa apparently does not train very well or most insulting women somehow cannot retain their training then we are expected to believe that such a rookie has no problem figuring out another countrys complicated space systems by referring quickly to a manual every science fiction movie takes liberties with the way the physical world really works but this movie is painful because it is basically trying to base its reputation on its realism the special effects are impressive but i would not agree that we are in new territory and the story itself has such flaws that i really did not much care if bullocks character lived or died by the end and i love bullock i think the academy award should go to the marketing department for this movie which sold the actors and the special effects so well that the story became irrelevant this movie will not survive the ages 
very slow movie and not very interesting special effects are best part but get old too a real losers not worth the time or money 
the acting by sandra bullock and george clooney is fine the story is lame and the only redeeming qualities are the special effect visuals okay does anyone think that a person could enter and operate three different countries space vehicles with mo training i dont think so enjoy the view 
this movie was not nearly deserving of stars in every category i rated it one star to better offset all of the delusional reviews on here visuals starsscreenplay starsdialogue starrealism staracting starssoundtrack starsthatd be a far more realistic rating the only high points are the visual effects although the initial shot of the cg shuttle looks a little fake and getting to see more of sandras figure than usual the dialogue is complete throw away the laws of physics reality and probability are grossly abused in terms of positions of satellites orbital mechanics the fact that the debris field had no chance of intercepting the shuttle once let alone three times actual spacesuit gloves are far too stiff to deftly grab at objects but in the film they were grabbing things with ease the jetpacks speed and maneuverability is greatly exaggerated compared to reality trying to navigate space with a fire extinguisher would be a very difficult task in reality its obvious that without any sort of monster in the film to scare us they turned the debris into a kind of monster technical flaws aside its really the plot and character interaction that turned the film into a wash the actors sandra b are barely utilized in terms of their acting potential ive also decided that george clooney is really just a failed attempt to clone sean connery and that his presence and demeanor is more often drab annoying and predictable than anything else id rather have had nicholas cage at least nick is more interesting to watch its like the director was out to make a movie that portrayed the calm quiet and nothingness of space but then grew bored and decided that he wished he were instead making a space monster film with peril and dangers attacking the crew at every turn ergo the malignant debris field the raging fire etc everything he can find is out to get them save the spaceship itself even the absurd amount of action wouldnt be so bad if the character interaction were at least halfway decent the acting itself isnt the problem its the directors terrible direction combined with a mediocrely written screenplay there was nothing going on between anyone to make it worth watching like in the way twisters interpersonal drama kept us hooked well beyond what the twisters alone could do or just about any other space oriented film i could name even the soundtrack is poorly conceived trying to impress upon the audience the absolute quiet of space with that crescendoing sound that makes you expect an impinging disaster it was cool the first time but reusing it throughout the film turned it into a too obvious borderline amateurish gimmick the only recent space drama i can think of thats worse than gravity are the latest star trek reboot films as if they ever had a snowballs chance in heck of capturing the vibe and spirit of what made tos great but thats another review bottom line is this movie is a good rental but theres no way its good enough to justify owning it at full retail 
this is one of the worst movies i have ever watched the premise is ridiculous this female astronaut who is extremely shaky emotionally engineers an escape that is beyond absurd and ridiculous she manages to use not one but two foreign space stations to escape her predicament and bullocks acting performance is pathetically bad i cant believe she was oscar nominated for that garbage if you want to watch special effects have at it just dont expect to be entertained by anything even remotely possible in reality and you will see sandra bullock almost exclusively throughout the movie i wish i could get the two hours and i wasted on this piece of crap back again 
if you are into special effects then this movie is for you if you have any technical abilities then you have to question why hollywood would think we are so naive to fall for this story i mean the story line is first lets wipe out the us space shuttle and kill everyone but the commander and some no tech skilled scientist ms sandy bullock but thank goodness the international space station is there to save them however after she gets there lets wipe out the international space station too then thank god the chinese have abandoned their space station and its close by and finally lets wipe that out too oh btw she has no flight training but manages to take control of the chinese capsule by reading the pilots manual in flight and survives the descent to earth really ultimately lets have our heroine after all this land in the middle of a lake almost sink and die again only to miraculously swim ashore and walk back to some civilization located down a dusty road wherever that may be they should have had a band playing on the shore line to welcome her back at least the music might be good 
i think what bothered me the most about this movie was that she was so very happy when she got back to earth i would have just laid on the ground and cried for hours if that traumatic event happened to me so i felt that this part was a wee bit unrealistic well the whole movie was unrealistic but there are better unrealistic movies out there i sincerely felt that her instantly switching gears from being terrified and suicidal to all of a sudden feeling excited and hopeful was a little cliche and again unrealistic i just have one question why not the americans blasting their own satellite and having it be americas fault for once hmmmmmmm how do you spell political agenda most of the acting in this movie is just basically heavy breathing panting gasping and hyperventilating for the purpose of conveying fear or because the astronaut is out of oxygen the rest of the acting is an astronaut or two bouncing off of space stuff like balls in a pinball machine nice special effects though that gets you one star 
this was about as exciting as watching butter melt the most over rated flick in years this film proves that cgi has replaced a good screenplay and bullocks middle class middle aged looks and acting couldnt save this if elizabeth taylorghost co starred instead of that sappy faced dullard clooney 
i just cant believe anyone could think this was a good movie theres no plot no character development and it is rife with inaccuracies anyone who has watched a single eva when we were flying the space shuttles in orbit would know that even the motions of the actors were unbelievable not worth wasting your time or money on this if you know anything about the space program unless youre also able to live in a state where you can totally forget reality even then this suffers from a lack of any real storyline 
this is a the rip off edition of the blu ray it has absolutely no special features and is missing the additional footage being added to the film wait for the special edition set to come out later this year if youve got a craving for this awesome movie either rent it or just go watch in d at your local theater you wont regret watching it you will regret buying this disc though 
if all you are interested in is special effects and shoot um up action then this is the movie for you however if you want even a hint of a good plot and characters then this movie is very lacking avatar has outstanding special effects but absolutely nothing more beyond the special effects are a bunch of stale over used predictable plot lines with a bunch of stale over used predictable characters you had the crusty cantankerous scientist with a heart of gold and the unfeeling corporate executive only interested in profits the leading male played by sam worthington was a poorly rehashed rambo but the worst was the marine commander who i dub colonel cliche the basic story line of the movie was very good and avatar actually started out pretty good up to and including the scene where sam worthingtons character was rescued by zoe saldanas character after that it was just one moronic predictable cliche after another some of the action was beyond ridiculous one of the gun boat pilots didnt like the mission and deserted the battle scene and no disciplinary action happened to her you even see her a few scenes later helping in the jail break which itself was inane two people go into the prison pretending to deliver food overpower the one and only guard hit a couple of buttons not even a password was needed and the prisoner is gone even th century jails had better security i could go on and on but you get my point if you look beyond the special effects this movie was awful now days it seems that hollywood too often uses special effects to cover up bad acting bad directing and bad writing and avatar is a prime example of this 
if this was the movie james cameron has wanted to do since he was a teen then maybe he should have taken better notes or should have taken a very sharp editors eye to his script because while this film is indeed pretty and a spellbinding achievement in the most stunningly realistic cg of any movie today the plot is almost insulting in how stale cliched and just plain boring ordinary and generic it is theres no surprises to be had you know exactly whos going to win and whos going to lose you know exactly how different action not just fight sequences will turn out you know exactly what characters will live and which will die which ones will have an abrupt heel face turn and which ones will turn out to be good all along i cant really tell just why such a film like this comes out so cheesey and cliche in terms of its plot whereas a film like star wars in its trilogy contains a great many classical and common elements of folk tale and mythology and literature and yet manages to be a stellar and timeless story this story in avatar is anything but the only thing that will be memorable of this movie is its visual effects right from the start the film does wonders with visual effects showing us a highly realistic looking sleeper ship and a zero g environment on board that neither looks overly cartoony or overly cgd it looks perfectly real all around every effect just screams real real real from the computer monitors and holographic displays to the plants and vegetation and variety of animals cameron does not overindulge us by making us look at everything in detail showing off but neither does he rush through intricate details in an attempt to stay grounded to the script its a perfect mix of showing us nifty new creatures and inventions without stalling long enough to make us think hes showing off the navi start off looking quite real but very blatantly cg theres a very slight sense of artificiality in the avatars when they are first on screen and shown awakening and interacting with humans but as the movie progresses the effects seem to get better and better to a point where towards the end when navi and humans interact closely both of them look incredibly real as though the navi were a huge puppet creation and yet its entirely cg where they went all out with the visuals they completely lost it with the story it becomes less avatar and more dances with wolves in space or virtually any generic action adventure film in space the parallels with dances with wolves are the most powerful likely due to the commonplace aspect of it but the story doesnt treat this as some sort of surprise nor does it even try to be distinct in some way you know exactly how characters are going to react to situations you know exactly whats going to happen next you know that the generic nerd sidekick appears jealous and resentful of jake sully sam worthington now but you know later on hes going to become the hero who tries to save him you know that sully is going to be initially hated by action girl love interest zoe saldana but eventually get her to love him you know that bad ass action girl michelle rodriguez is going to betray the humans and side with sully and the navi you know that certain characters are going to die you know that sully will earn the trust and respect of the tribe you know that sully is going to admit hes been spying on the navi and cause action girl love interest to cry and scream and hate him and tell him to go away you know this and that and everything its all so obvious that it becomes stupefyingly boring and you wouldnt have ever noticed that fact if the movie werent so much fun to look at but while the effects and even much of the story was interesting enough to keep me drawn in the most spectacular visual effect focus was on the navi themselves and the navi themselves as a society were a breakneck yank out of immersion and into a silly and childish realization they are exact alien copies of native americans they are exact copies from the mohawks to the way the elder father and mother characters look and dress and sound to the high pitched yipping sound they give in battle they are exact copies of native americans it would seem to me that this element was lazily left in from the ripping off of the plot of dances with wolves and that would probably be a great discussion point but like a great many modern pc portrayals of native americans they sugarcoat them so much they become just as racist as the savage red man blue man portrayed in older stories these navi americans are so in touch with their environment they can talk to animals by sticking tentacles in their hair into plugs coming out of the animals heads they can wrap these tentacles around long tendrils from the tree of souls to pray directly to their god they have to cry and chant a ritual chant every time they kill an animal they use bow and arrows ride on animals and make yipping sounds like the natives in old cowboy and indian movies and storypieces it wouldnt be so bad and it never really ventures into a racist depiction especially since most of all these are aliens and not native americans but the parallels are too strong to ignore this is not even a metaphor or parody or horatian satire these navi are nearly word for word copies of stereotypical native americans with a little bit from everywhere such as the caribbean sounding elder mother to the great chief man sitting bull sounding elder father to the warrior son with the mohawk and pithy attitude to sully but since these arent native americans and they are aliens james cameron can get away with essentially portraying them as the stereotype of the in perfect harmony and touch with mother nature good guys whereas the humans with the exception of only the obvious ones and the nerdy pacifist scientists are all evil greedy corporate thinking scum who cant do anything with a planet except rape it and kill it slowly for resources as though environmentalism efforts today would never ever work out or catch on thanks for the faith cameron while the story is essentially glossed over with a spiffy coat of paint to seem new ish theres no real need to worry about spoilers theres nothing here we havent seen before and nothing here that wasnt told better and more realistically in other movies and stories its a stereotypical white men vs indians tale of the s with the evil humans being thwarted by the holy navi and yet we get the unfortunate implication that the navi apparently could not have survived or banded together without the leadership of jake sully white man sky person thanks for the subtle racism james cameron 
avoid seeing this cameron ego trip on the small screen because its confused and overall horrid script and muddy characterizations will not have a massive screen to carry things along this is a typical example of hollywoods all flash and no substance take away the flash by reducing your screen size and the hollow shell will certainly disappoint you skip the home versions 
great computer effects terrible plot bad movie have we all gone so brain dead pretty computer graphics and all of a sudden no one can point out that this movie had a awful stript and terrible acting 
avatar is the example of a film that got by on only its special effects the characters were so flat they werent even two dimensional they were completely predictable and stereotypical the bad guys were so formulaic they were mere parodies come on couldnt cameron make real bad bad guys heck ive had elementary school teachers more evil and heinous than avatars antagonists the good guys were just lame none of the characters had any depth whatsoever the plot was about as simplistic and predictable as its possible to get godzilla movies show more creativity and intricacy in their plot structure 
first let me sayed that i loved avatar and would rate it stars for the movie itself my one star rating is solely to warn people that fox has already announced blu ray versions of avatar this early release version contains no extras of any kind i e no additional scenes no running commentary no trailers no anything there will be an avatar special edition released on blu ray in time for christmas this year and a d special edition released sometime next year i urge fans of this movie not to purchase this crippled early release and if you cannot wait to see avatar in your home theater then you can just as easily rent this version from netflix and then purchase either the special edition or d edition once they are released as movie fans we must band together to send a message to the studios that we will not accept their blatant multi dip marketing tactics and will only purchase these movies when they include all of the special features that current technology allows 
if you must read more then by all means enjoy plot was ridiculously predictable not your typical easy to figure out type of movie so shallow it was insulting fore shadowing of a caliber that a year old might need to be checked for developmental delays if they were unable to tell you exactly was about to happen throughout the movie although i dont doubt a year old might be over whelmed by the visual effects they were out of stars worthy but being shiny doth not a good movie make im sure i will receive numerous replies about how wonderful it was and by all means if thats your opinion express it in a review or however you wish just dont condemn my opinion for being different than yours lets reserve that for political discussions 
i understand why some critics didnt like the movie but i still loved it i want to watch it again and again and soon but i will not buy this featureless release please people vote with your dollar just like lord of the rings tell the studios that you demand a quality release with bonus features you want a digital version you can play on your computer or other portable device you want at least the option to see the extended scenes tell them you demand all of these features or you will take your money elsewhere if all they are going to offer you is little better than the pirated version you can buy on any street corner or download from the net well 
four stars for the movie which is a stunning feast for the eyes with a plot just good enough to carry it off it is an action movie afterall add in a little earth concious message for some depth and meaning this is a terrific movie particularly by the standards of its genre i wont continue on since reviews and synopsis are many and people visiting this site are likely already fans my gripe this will not be the extended version in d i dont understand after numerous releases and the extended version already out why they just couldnt get it done this time the movie is no longer that new double triple quadruple dipping is a retail reality particularly with popular movies and the likes of james cameron he needs another sub for his own deep sea exploring however at this point its getting a little rediculous we endured the long indignity of the panasonic exclusive crap they really needed to step up and reward fans this time and they failed please dont humor these people with another purchase just rent or preferably borrow the disc until they release the extended d version you can most likely see it for free i see absolutely no merit in a purchase when many fans have more than one version already and can get the d from a friend or rental somewhere for mega fans i am not dissing the movie or even so much the practice its just in this case they should have gone full bore and instead they went off half cocked i will remove the review if they miraculously change their minds 
disneys pocahontas story is back bigger and badder than before at least badder imagine a hallucinogenic induced version two of pocahontas rife with stereotypes and cheesy lines worthy of the maker of titanic that is avatar previously avatars director cameron held the distinction of creating one of the most over rated films in history titanic now he holds the distinction of creating two this movie was overrated in nearly every aspect its storyline was a sci fi under the sea version of pocahontas complete with the done to death evil businesses out to rule the world staple of so many films of course avatar mixed stereotypical characters and less than stellar dialogue in with this original offering the characters themselves were not terribly likeable the acting was good but the cheesy lines did nothing to help it not to mention that the two leading female characters were about as friendly as acid and of course avatar was heralded for its tremendous graphics on that score i can say only this i did not see the d version but the dvd version was surprisingly lousy shiny plasticy looking textures and mediocre video game graphics abounded i know this review puts me in the minority but in summation the only good thing about this film was the acting and unfortunately the actors and actresses were performing in a steaming pile of crap 
and dont watch this movie its terrible one dimensional characters a cliched and hackneyed plot and some of the worst dialog since twilight was forced on the eager masses do yourself a favor and dont bother with this over hyped piece of garbage this film is basically a protoype representing what is possible with the new computer generated technology but the movie itself is slapped together and has little or no redeeming quality there are so many things in the movie that just dont make sense with the exception of sigourney weaver who is quite good in the movie there are absolutely no notable performances the direction movies are taking where an entire film can be shot inside a computer or against blue screens some of the magic is lost nothing feels real i guess we are supposed to sympathize with the protagonist but there is no depth to him at all in fact there is no depth to any of the characters almost every single one of them is a simple cliche which isnt a problem and in fact some very good movies are made without any sort of originality but when you want an audience to really connect to the movie youre making you have to give them something to grab on to i am obviously in the minority but i watched it with my dad and brother and none of us could get past how awful the dialog is the story isnt original but it isnt necessarily bad its really the poor casting choices and the poor script that bring this movie down after the movie ended i pictured sam worthington reading through the script turning to james cameron laughing and saying no really wheres the real script and apparently even with the development of intergalactic space space travel the military is still stuck in the th century how exactly would a racist redneck be put in command of an entire military base why would you want someone like that in place when you know they just want to go out and kill everything that moves see they could have done that but then the movie should have been about the navi mounting a resistance i dont understand why they bothered trying to have peaceful negotiations at all with a military leader like that things are only going to end one way really the whole movie really just felt like one plot convenience after another like no real effort was put into making sure that there were emotionally connecting reasons behind why the people in the story did what they did i understand that james cameron has pushed the boundaries in avatar of what is possible on a technical level but he should not have directed the movie he should have been the dp director of photography on the movie when you spend almost a decade messing with cameras d blue screens motion capture and everything else little attention gets paid to things like script actors characters plot etcetera 
so is this the best selling movie of all time well it is certainly the most over hyped and overrated movie of all time dont get me wrong i really enjoy good science fiction movies but this is nothing more than typical hollywood social commentary wrapped up in a long and boring melodrama with unrealistic and drawn out action scenes the social commentary becomes paramount to the movie and prevents this from being any more than a simplistic storyline with stereotypical characters who have unimaginative roles there are no suprises here no unexpected turns or twists it almost verges on satire the movie is supposed to be futuristic with complex technology and sophisticated technological operations on planet pandora you would think it would require humans with specialized training sophistication as well yet the guy running the robotic bulldozer is portrayed as some redneck in in his flannel shirt and baseball cap the evil money grubbing corporate guy is dressed in a present day shirt and tie practicing his golf skills in the middle of the operations room t shirts present day military outfits bows and arrows futuristic give us a break 
first the theatrical release then the extended directors cut now the d theatrical release please note this is the shorter version be prepared to but it again or wait for the d extended directors cut the of course will be followed by the ultimate d ultraviolet deluxe edition with smellovision which makes sense because these quadruple dipping tactics really stink 
im not sure why but these amazon episodes of season are missing about five minutes per episode when i compared episode on amazon to the pbs broadcast version i found most of the missing material to be important for viewers to understand what is happening in the series amazon advertises this as original uk version but in seasons and the uk versions have more running time and the usa pbs version are the shortened edited versions very confusing if you want the most for your money wait a few weeks for the dvds and make sure these episodes run the full minutes instead of the edited minute versions 
if you do not want to hear the ending stop reading now i love movies that have happy endings if you also love happy endings season is not for you this movie has one death that is hard to take and if anna and bates happiness is suppose to compensate for that death all i can say is the writers are not reading their customers viewers correctly as for this seasons ending this better be one of those cliff hangers where he is just seriously injured and lives after all i will not be pre ordering season thats for sure 
series was a huge disappointment to me for several reasons the stories did not flow as nicely as series and for instance the storyline about matthews indecision about taking reggie swires fortune was a total waste of time it added nothing to the series and it only served to show marys ugly side i also didnt understand why some of the characters personalities changed for instance lord grantham suddenly became an incompetent loser who couldnt seem to hold things together then we have two new footmen and cousin rose who were awful additions all of the stories involving the two footmen and rose seemed to be written in a hurry and thrown in willy nilly and again did not add anything to the continuing saga of downton abbey and for all the hype about shirley maclaine being added to the cast and her interaction with maggie smiths character that was a total bust shirley maclaines acting was awful and her role was so small that she could have phoned it in the so called brilliant exchanges with maggie smith never materialized and what happened to cora they should have killed off her character when she had the spanish flu because all she does is walk through the scenes with that silly smile and her head lowered the only time she showed any emotion was when lady sybil died other than that she does nothing useful and surprisingly shows very little interest in sybils baby not once did she hold the baby branson is another character who underwent a huge personality change he became a robot he needs to ride off into the sunset with his daughter the deaths of two main characters did not bother me so much as the poor script it appears to me that fellowes has gotten bored with downton or maybe his mind has been too much on the american program he is making as i understand it other writers will be making the future scripts and thats usually not a good thing i enjoyed the first two series of downton abbey immensely but series has turned me off so much that i dont think i will be watching it in the future 
the whole family is geared up waiting for season we even rewatch season in anticipation the actors and actresses are so good the characters they play are so interesting we watched modern vs tradition and love love love maggies role as the matriarch of the family and then what happens oh yeah if something good happens something very evil must happen and not just once but twice and whats left no details i dont want to give it away but then i should so others dont watch it my son and his wife were so totally bummed that they are not ever going to watch it again my husband and i then proceeded and i had to take some time off because of grief and then the finale did the writers forget that we love these characters and without them the show just isnt the same also is there no imagination left to continue a story if thats what happened then season should have been the end we are all disgusted with season and the lack of imagination and the removal of the heart of the story if the writers would ask me i would tell them that it isnt tragedy that makes a good show it is the characters we are interested in the characters and all the actors and actresses were playing their parts excellently they make the story 
what a load of pretentious crap and utterly predictable at that nothing more than a tiresome collection of shopworn plot devices and cliches i guess some hack figured that if they could package it as a stuffy period drama they could sell it even though its just more of the same but with lush locations and actors with proper british accents all of a sudden it becomes highbrow sure that and will get you an overpriced cup of coffee that you can enjoy while you feel as though you are broadening your horizons why not just watch a proper soap opera and be done with it at least those dont try to pretend to be something they arent much of the cast is superb though its a shame they chose to lower themselves to participate in something this embarrassingly bad 
my wife particularly wanted to see series of this event i purchased this item but it was a waste of our time it was disjointed froze for minutes at a time and we finally gave up we watch amazoin prime often without a problem this certainly item did not happen for us
just finished watching season three and sadly that was my last season if killing off two of the most beloved characters was deemed necessary then this series is done happily well always have seasons one and two 
just watched the final episode of season it sucks eggs big time and and casts a pall over the entire season i find in its aftermath that im not especially interested to see what happens next a big dramatic turn that in my opinion is wholly unnecessary and serves to kill ones interest rather than pique it 
and i say i wasted hours because thats all of the movie i could sit through i didnt even bother getting to the end the worst thing is that this movie had a roster of great actors michael shannon amy adams kevin costner diane lane russell crowe chris meloni lawrence fishburn but couldnt do anything with them their talents were wasted in this flick the script was poor and the storyline didnt make sense did anyone who produced this movie read the superman comic books one of the main parts of the original comic that makes superman fascinating is the fact that no one knows who superman is particularly lois lane the clark kent alter ego makes the story interesting instead they make clark out to be some drifter with no purpose in life what nonsense also what made the original superman movie and other big budget films of the s like star wars and close encounters was that less is actually more its time for hollywood to get off its cgi addiction and get back to simple down to earth special effects back then the production effort was spent on characters storyline and special effects these days its all about the visual graphics and not about the story its a direction for disaster its why low budget films like the kings speech make m and run away with oscars and man of steel lays a fat egg at the box office and burns a hole in the movie studios wallet 
i would have walked out on this dog after minutes if i hadnt invested a kingly sum in tickets popcorn candy and pop i hated everything about this film crappy handheld jerky camera work throughout the whole film natural color washed out with a blue tone ridiculous never ending jumbled flashbacks and believe it or not this poor excuse for a director was hired to do a sequel no thanks ill be popping corn at home watching a marvel movie instead 
admittedly admittedly i only sat through minutes of this hour and minute ponderous piece of nonsense that s because after fifteen minutes of watching great stupid rubbery creatures flap around and the worst acting this side of a san francisco porno studio i felt my brain melting inside my cranium and my eyeballs ready to burst and knew i was approaching a state of mind in which i might do a hunter thompson on my own tv set im trying to imagine what the target audience is for such a film now that we in the us have seen this film made at least four hundred times villages of media starved vietnamese sitting in large auditoriums spooning in rice masses of north koreans herded into halls in their prison camps for evening entertainment specially selected groups requiring extra incentive at guantanemo i admit to a brief flare of hope when michael shannon boardwalk empire the iceman appeared in the first few minutes but the man appeared to be on neurontin or thorazine and his acting was so poorly delivered and uninspired that he appeared to be in a fugue state when russell let me slam this phone over your head for starters crow appeared i groaned knowing the thousands of close ups of beard and sideburns that were coming at least brando who was probably stoned out of his mind while playing supermans father was amusing to watch but this is a ponderous mess that makes john carter of mars high art by comparison what a hideous waste of time and money 
superhero movies are best when they deliver on their humanity but this one fills the vast majority of its hours with cgi explosions and superbodies crashing through every kind of thing imaginable though of course never getting really hurt there were a couple moments of cool re imagining supermans formative years but again not nearly enough to overcome the trite and supremely cliche superhero fighting that dominates 
all computer generated junk spaceships that look like lady bugs no romance with clark and lois at all to get you interested or invested in the stars relationship is ice cold with metro sexual superman that wears lip stick and hair gel by the pound people in charge are blacks now with earrings that lead giant companies military or conservative newspapers even computer generated giant eyes in clark and lois that are fake as can be is nothing real anymore acting was very poor except for crow and story could have been very good if direction was better and different choice of stars for sure all in all just another piece of junk that kids will love and will get good ratings because in this country we worship violence if its the number of explosions you measure and number of booms your counting that never end in this film because this society needs its mayhem fix then youll love this tripe if on the other hand you have a clue what a good movie is youll walk away from this feeling cheated out of your money once again 
having read and watched superman since the s this has to be one of the worst creations ive seen while henry cavill makes a fine superman the story flies like a rock even superman returns is better than this the movie with c reeve was much better and more in keeping with the comics at the time since i havent purchased a superman comic in the past years maybe this is the superman of today the superman i grew up with would never ever kill as kal el says in whatever happened to the man of tomorrow nobody has the right to kill not mxyzptlk not you lois not superman especially not superman the dvd interview with cast and crew was ok but i was insulted as to their thinking that they the writers were explaining clarks coming to grips with his being different and how this was so innovated hello buy the season series of smallvile which i give stars i know things change but im sure there are a few out there with old time values 
in this re boot of the superman franchise the powers that be took a perfectly good superman story and turned it into a tedious generic sci fi flick filled with brainless violence and mindless sci fi drivel there arent enough adjectives in the english language for me to adequately describe how utterly horrible this movie is if i could give it negative five stars i would do it the story is one dimensional at best there is virtually no character development some of the dialogue is so ridiculous its as if the writers assumed most of the audience would be made up of people with a single digit iq like when zod tells superdude during their climactic ha battle scene this is going to end one way with my death or yours duh no kidding sherlock where did you park your squad car if you like mindless violence and tedious special effects devoid of any real story then this is your kind of movie however if you like good story telling and character development that allows you to actually care about what happens to the characters then move along there is nothing to see here 
if you liked christopher reeves if you think superman is a good and simple man a man who always stands for simple old fashioned american ethics if you think superman is strong and unwavering in his righteousness and these are the reasons you like the character then please do not watch this movie ill warn you youre going to get angry when you try to sit through this thing this movie is just one more example of hollywoods sickness taking everything that was previously good and i mean good in the altruistic way and turning it into a contorted modern flawed ugly thing they have destroyed so many of the nice and righteous parts of our culture by rewriting them or rebooting them this is another sad example of how the soulless hollywood machine can no longer express any goodness everything even superman is flawed gray and unattractive nothing can be simply brave and true and simple anymore they think thats progress they dont see that its actually digression sad superman over the last years has stood as a fictional symbol of simplicity goodness well as he used to say truth justice and the american way now we see the media machine pumping out a driveling pathetic self pitying little floppy haired pouty boy as the man of steel it is interesting that as american itself doesnt any longer stand for truth and justice neither does its central comic book symbolic hero the whole altruistic good vision is gone from the minds of our movie makers theyve lived too long in a gray shadowed existence in their all too real world of corporate compromise gone are the days of simple good male character finding their way onto the silver screen and when they do come back they are changed beyond recognition the saddest thing about this is that the younger generation will just eat this up and think that this emo superdud is what this character is heres some annoyances youll have to swallow if you decide to torture yourself with this movie krypton is failing because of their environmentally unsound industrial practices oh my how obvious can the brainwashing agenda be cant they just make a movie anymore or does it all have to be some sort of message device a soap box when i pay to be entertained i am not paying to be preached at yet again about how terrible we are to the planet guilt guilt guilt o k i feel crappy about using fossil fuels now what i cant just watch a superman movie for an hour or two and then get back to the guilt after that no cant we just watch a freakin comic book movie and have a little fun no no you cant everything must be on message uh such a waste inevitably all these dvds need to be thrown in the dumpster dont worry though if you like being preached at theyve got more for you old self pitying superbrat needs to save the off shore oil rig from itself in a big explosion scene at least this stops his super poutying teenage angst for a minute or two but again can these soulless hollywood types think their own thoughts at all no they saw oil spills on the news and it was getting ratings and so they thought that was a good idea preachy and transparent i really dislike movies that arent really what theyre supposed to be and are actually about getting bullet points or messages into the audience again i thought i was buying a comic book movie this may seem small but to the superman fan it is not its a detail but ive always thought them smart to avoid the scruff the beard shaving in almost all superman movies and tv they avoid this issue very wisely i think what on the planet can he shave with bullets literally bounce off his pupils so what does he shave with almost all other directors and producers cared just enough about the suspension of disbelief enough to avoid this issue these filmmakers thought it more important to make him look cool or dramatic than to make the character make sense again if youre not really a comic book person sci fi fan or superman buff you might think this point silly but it is not krypton originally it simply died of old age it was vague way back when but it is clear that there was no rebellion or internal war it is so pathetic that hollywood has to take a place of enlightened higher level beings and lower them down not only to our brutal human level but to this very moment of war and brutality no longer is superman and his race a dream or ideal of an advanced species we might try to be like no longer are we in awe of their peace and beauty no they are dumb and warlike like us great right dont you just identify with them so much more now that they cannot focus on the environmental issues tearing their planet apart because theyre too busy killing each other isnt it great that theyre just like us these stupid filmmakers think people tune into superman to see ourselves no superman is supposed to be an ideal not a reflection of our own inadequacies we can get into zod and all the rewriting if you like but lets just cut to the chase they have no ideas in their manikin heads out there in southern california everything is a pale rewrite of some previous material they cannot simply pick superman up where the last movie left off and writing from there no they have to retell the beginning because they have no original thoughts all the media machine can do is regurgitate the same plots each time releasing it with more bile left all over the product than the last time so we have to use superman ii ideas we have to retell the beginning of superman i and we have to puke it up through the ugly and contorted lens of our modern gray minds theyve forgotten what good looks like theyve forgotten how think and apparently they dont seem to hire those people what are they called oh its been so long since weve seen one oh yeah theyre called writers re writers seem to fit the bill just fine note to any hollywood writers out there if someone asks you to take an old idea that was good and touch it rewrite it or otherwise make it palatable for the modern audience you should remember that youre a artist not an office secretary artists create they do not destroy other peoples creations and call themselves artists no one calls themselves a painter when theyve painted a new mona lisa we call them forgers i mean this movie is an amalgam of pop culture hot words terraforming oil spill coup d eacute tat military investigation genetic engineering blah blah etc tiring obvious soap box big media messaging wrapped in a flesh of a childish unmanly super emo man whos self doubt and pity are pathetic this is certainly not jerry siegel and joe shusters superman you actually like that guy max fleischers superman would not understand this movie at all he lived in a different time a simpller time when good was obvious and superman was a symbol of strength period george reeves superman was like your ideal strong caring dad figure compared to this super brat who is like your wimpy video game playing pouty teenage emo son and finally christopher reeves likable kind simply strong bold loving and brave superman would simply shake his head and feel sorry for this pathetic little thing christopher as a human was immensely more charismatic and as an actor was well a good actor you believed he was superman and finally you liked him and you like superman you wanted to be like him and as a parent you didnt mind your child wanting to be like him i do not think man of steel is appropriate for small children the way almost all other superman series were i certainly dont want my son to be like this guy id suggest passing on this movie i wish i could give it zero stars its the worst superman anything ever finally superman does not kill he is supposed to be a good person period therefore this is not superman so sad so very very sad 
this is not only the worst superman ever made but maybe the worst movie of the year completely lacking in anything enjoyable it is literally like watching a video game that you are not even playing there is no banter between lois and clark and you can hardly believe their kiss at the end because it came out of nowhere this is supposedly the movie that people wanted a push towards batman in its darkness which i loved in the dark knight but for any fan of superman this is not it appropriate its not fun 
there are so many problems with this film its sad the flashbacks are incredibly distracting the explosions are absolutely overdrawn superman causes more damage to metropolis than the villain the blatant product placement is absolutely shameful yeah just skip this one 
man of steel is by far the worst movie of i hated this movie it was boring there is too much violence and destruction in the film it was total chaos too much cgi special effect too i prefer the smallville tv series over this crap i know director zack snyder is not richard donner but henry cavill is not superman this movie sucks this movie is a disaster i give man of steel an f 
why on earth did they make a superman movie thats just as convoluted dire and un entertaining as superman returns this movie steals large chunks and visuals from the matrix the thing and avengers the story is all over the place so many people die for no reason mostly its just not any fun not for a second what a missed opportunity 
all hype and not good at all total disappointment i am a huge superman fan ive watched all the cartoons the original superman smallville you name it i watched it and this is the worse one yet 
 from the digital bits lots of people are buying the blu ray or blu ray d version of man of steel on amazon expecting to get a premium content experience for their money but instead theyre discovering that if you buy the same title at wal mart its got two exclusive featurettes the iconic characters of man of steel min and the sonic landscape of man of steel min if youre a fan of man of steel and youve just purchased the highest priced version of the title hoping to dig into tons of great special edition material its frustrating to find out that unless you buy a second copy at wal mart you dont even get all of the special feature content you were hoping for it gets worse target has an exclusive blu ray version too that includes five more featurettes under the heading x ray vision min total only available there so now if you want everything youre faced with the choice of potentially having to buy two versions of the same title while possibly returning your original amazon copy which had none of the exclusive content send the studios a message and avoid buying any version of this blu ray 
every so often hollywood lays a real big budget egg and this one squawks its way through two and a half heavily special effects laden dreadfully tedious hours the dialogue is preposterously embarrassingly bad the plot is ridiculous and a number of a list actors are utterly wasted including kevin costner as supermans earth father russell crowe as his krypton father diane lane as his earth mother and amy adams playing lois lane here are some samples of the dialogue earth authorities as they detect an alien spaceship positioned above the earth im just speculating but i think whoever is at the helm of that thing is preparing to make a dramatic entrance space alien from krypton to diane lane the craft he arrived in where is it go to hell as you can see the dialogue is stilted and amateurish and awful the kind of stuff that makes you feel very embarrassed for the actors the special effects are quite good but there is a relentless nonstop barrage of them and the plot bangs from pillar to post often making any sense this is far and away the worst of the superman movies a super dud 
the film is done stupidly and the director and producers are everyone to blame it on it cuts back and forth between present time and memories relies far to much on bang boom special effects fine actors but the storyline is very messed up and is a prep for batman vs superman who would care about that 
seven years later and were stuck with yet another origin story the cartoonish man of steel goes on forever while offering nothing new bludgeoning its audience to no end zack snyders bombastic humorless direction trashes the superman legend and wastes an impressive cast in the process plenty of cgi overkill but little humanity or entertainment value except for superman iv the man of tomorrows worst theatrical feature overall rating 
the best part of this movie is what you see in the preview period no story to sink your teeth into no character build up no humor lots of special effects and lots of bludgeoning and predictable stunts and an hour too long sure glad i didnt pay to watch it 
in shortman of steel begins with a well done minute setup on krypton relying heavily on fairly well designed stunningly executed computer graphics and would probably rate out of on its own the remainder of the movie is almost entirely action in excellent seamless cg but repetitive and excessive and utterly lacking in any other essential components of a story such as plotting and character development and with problems of internal inconsistency and implausibility the resolution is implausible and incomplete personal commentlike the hobbit man of steel could have been greatly improved by cutting a half hour of unnecessary repetitive gratuitous violence im a guy i like action but it simply went on and on so long and so repetitively that it got boring it really burns my butt that a superb series like stargate universe was canceled because the very limited computer graphics were too expensive five minutes of the cg wasted on man of steel or hobbit could have paid for a whole season of sg u the whole budget of sg u not just the cg critique from a storytellers perspective man of steel is unconstrained even by the laws of physics the aliens are utterly invincible and omnipotent so the audience is reduced to passive observers of the inexplicable that is very poor storytelling the best stories are about successes which are achieved with great difficulty by struggling within constraints of law of human nature of expectations of morality etc many stories are precisely about stretching or testing those limits this is what stories are made of because these are precisely the challenges we all experience in our ordinary lives rules of the game in fantasy or any game or any sport which are very simplified fantasy worlds the rules are essential not merely important but rather essential if the audience knows the rules of the game or constraints of the fantasy world they can become involved by anticipating potential problems and they can figure out solutions to the problems example when watching football the main viewer activity is yelling at the quarterback telling him what play to call and how to execute it would watching a football game be any fun if three were no rules at all no plays if any player could do anything at any time example in eragon the book not the mediocre movie doing magic was a great strain on the user so his her physical strength had to be conserved and wisely used readers could anticipate when a character might be be tempted to over extend himself readers could anticipate strategies which could be used do conserve strength and as it happened the character usually did what the reader expected or feared that made the reader a participant in the story and made the novels very satisfying same for rowling and tolkien novels and movies deus machina even the ancient greeks had a derisive term deus machina for poorly crafted stories which ended by a god just showing up and resolving all conflicts and problems by decree essentially by unconstrained unspecified magic the resolution of the movie when the big s smashed head first through the terraforming machine and black hole reactor and then snapped the even thicker neck of his equally invincible fellow alien were pure and self contradictory deus machina moments heroism i refuse to call the main character in this movie superman because he isnt the superman i grew up with the big s is supposed to be a heroic figure right heroism is about overcoming ordinary limits especially of fear and pain and scraping hard against absolute limits such as risking death if there are no limits no effort no challenge no risk there is no heroism there is nothing heroic about the big s an american emblem are we suppose to get all mushy over a guy the big s who selectively saves a few random individuals ignores dozens falling from buildings and indirectly murders tens of thousands by carelessly destroying occupied vehicles and buildings the big s is just a big dumb brainless thug a bull in a china shop the best you can say about him is that he is a thug on our side tragically is how most of the world thinks about america the superman of my childhood was an admirable moral man a strong man but a man who tried his best an appropriate symbol for the america which was once respected overdone actionviolence is pointless if all the characters are utterly invincible a contest of strength is only interesting if there is the possibility and likelihood that one will win and the other will loose the big s and his fellow aliens can be thrown through a dozen buildings without mussing their hair once you are satiated by the shear visual impact of the cg man of steel is about as exciting as watching two babies throw marshmallows at each other implausibilitiessuspension of disbelief can go only so far and man of steel was way over the top for any intelligent unimpaired individual why do invincible aliens pay the slightest attention to soldiers with mere guns when missiles have no effect on them why punch a helpless pathetic human when you can toss him or her a mile away with a flick of your wrist and these super aliens happen to carry knifes in case a knife fight with a human is in order really what happened to the aliens which were not on the terraforming machine when it was destroyed perhaps they just surrendered formed a little farming community in iowa and applied for green cards while it was reasonable that the original superman worked as a shy self effacing mild mannered newspaper reporter it is utterly implausible that the bulky negligent egocentric big s could do so is destroying multi million dollar aircraft really the best way a guy with god like powers and technology can conceal his liar from human eyes and just what lair is that wasnt his spaceship destroyed is the writer director confusing the big s with batman a complete list of implausibilities and inconsistencies could go on for pages the above are just the ones that particularly triggered my barf reaction man of steel is a two rolls of duct tape movie you wind it around your head to keep it from exploding graphic designthe design of much of the other worldly technology was imaginative but largely derivative that is most has been done before much has been done better and most of the original stuff simply makes no sense are these aliens color blind or just plain blind all their graphic displays are circular very low resolution monochrome apparently in flowing textured metal could you work with such a crappy computer display they might be great touch feel displays for the visually impaired blind but not so great for folks with normal vision ridiculous for aliens with super vision actingmany reviewers complain about the acting in my opinion the acting in the few pauses between the endless cg action scenes was mostly maudlin and cliched but adequate the failure of the underlying story to engage the audience was the fault of the directors editors not the actors stargate universe recommendationif you havent watched sg u since the series i very strongly recommend that you try it it is much better the second time and much better as binges the first time you watch sg u you dont know the characters and dont care what happens to them and so the story kinda drags but the second time you watch it is an entirely different experience you become emotionally involved because you know the characters the individual episodes aired a week apart were often depressing because the resolution didnt happen until next week but in binges of or episodes in an evening you get the crises and the resolutions together im not an sg fan in the normal since i know no sg trivia ive never been to an sg website i know nothing of the actors and you couldnt drag me to an sg convention yet ive watched the whole series times in binges months apart and every time i have enjoyed it more the two complete seasons are about each used or each new on dvd sgu stargate universe the complete first season sgu stargate universe the complete final season
 minutes into this movie i felt tired the editing pacing is weird and confusing the second half of the movie isso cgi heavy it feels like a video game that youre not in control of the director definitely doesnt understand the conceptof less is more the original superman starring christopher reeve unfolded and developed and when action occurred it was fresh and exciting it had atmosphere this movie hardly ever lets up and gives you time to think and when it does it feels forced all the quick zooming and lens flares and particle effects just make your head spin but for the gamer generations i guess anything else feels too slow if you have an explosion happen every seconds in a movie after about minutes the explosions have absolutely no impact or effect whatsoever i was bored glossy choppy overwhelming soulless ps the original superman was fun its supposed to be this is so dark and serious it just comes across as silly i mean its a guy flying around in his underwear lighten up 
i thought this movie was awful its nothing like superman should be grim cheerless joyless humorless depressing and boring are those the words that should come to mind when someone thinks superman probably the biggest problem here is supermans motivation here we have a superman motivated by childhood trauma where in all other incarnations superman is motivated by a sense of personal responsibility and his own goodness instilled in him by both his earthly and other earthly fathers having a superman motivated by personal confusion fear and pain just doesnt work theres no joy in this movie no love everyone in it is so serious at all times if anyone dares crack a smile it seems forced and out of place the father relationships in this movie are off big time the kryptonian father has nothing to do with his son at all only pops up in the middle to answer a question or two thats it his earthly father spends all his time obsessing over making clark feel so worried about his own powers that he shouldnt dare use them to help humanity the whole thing is just weird people in this movie dont act the way real people would when little clark saves his classmates instead of their parents saying thanks and thanking god for the miracle they just get all spooked and serious oh thats right i forgot because in this movie anytime something interesting happens its time to double down on the seriousness give me a break another big problem in this movie is there is no chemistry between the leads when supes is in prison and lois lane is interviewing they both start getting all smiley and making googly eyes at each other im sorry but this just does not work it seems forced and phony its there just because the plot dictates that the two are supposed to be together but the problem is this idea works against the character of the new superman they created by changing the backstory theyve made a superman who has no business caring about or loving anyone this is a superman who is so self absorbed so wrapped up in his own childhood trauma that he couldnt possibly step out of that for a few seconds and smile i hated the muddled plot in this movie it made no sense whatsoever kryptonian genetics an argument over eugenics what is all this nonsense the core problem of krypton is its imminent destruction not stem cell research no natural births on krypton oh kay and superman is the only one in years why because his body holds the codex thats supposed to i dont know allow him to repopulate a new krypton later after he assembles a harem of willing females the whole thing is just goofy and speaking of the codex is that kind of like the all spark are we watching a transformers movie here or what everything about this new superman was bizarre and wrong ironic since he has an enemy in the comics called bizarro i guess if they made a bizarro version of the superman in this movie it would be a superman we could actually like it is strange to think that i can look back on superman returns and say with no hesitation that that was a far better movie than this one that movie wasnt perfect or even great by any means but it had heart at least that superman cared about others when bryan singer made that movie he didnt get so wrapped up in the special effects that he forgot to give it a soul for me the biggest indightment against man of steel it is that it is not family friendly grim and grisly are not words that should come to mind when i think of superman yet here we have young clark terrified as he sees the skulls of his teacher and classmates an older one letting his father die because well who knows really to add to the drama i suppose and we see a superman sinking into a field of skulls how to explain that one to your kids i hated this movie it disgusted me it had awesome special effects sure but it had no heart and soul it was a superman parody a generic product for the masses driven by egotism and greed grade f 
most reviews ive read here were about the series regarding that theres nothing i can say that hasnt already been said what im rating and for which im giving one star is the adaptation to bluray i have purchased the original dvd set the original release of serenity the serenity dvd collectors edition and the serenity bluray collectors edition so when i purchased the bluray series collectors edition i expected something special however the only thing shiney about the bluray version of the series is the mirror side of the discs this is unfortunately one of the few bluray releases where i can honestly say the dvd release was better i can watch the dvd release in my upconvert bluray player and get splendid quality however when i play the bluray version the picture is grainy to the point of annoyance i do realize that part of the series was shot in a grainy manner on purpose and have made allowance for that but this entire release is grainy all the way through why this is the case i cannot fathom was firefly released prior to the release of hidef television was it shot in the old x standard and therefore did not transfer well to bluray did someone at the factory not know what s he was doing deciding to do a straight from dvd conversion without upconvert standards or perhaps attempting to push it to bluray quality and unfortunately resulting with an extremely grainy picture i dont know all i know is that most bluray movies ive seen i can see the pores on the actors chin in a close up shot in this release a closeup shot looks like someone photoshopped the faces with a splatterbrush effect i am sorry to see that this series was treated with such poor rendition in the bluray version and while this is a recommendation i seldom give for those who have not yet purchased this set i would most definitely recommend the dvd version instead 
this is the same old theatrical edition only nonsense give us seamless branching with extended edition to make everyone happy they have the technology for many years now to use seamless branching to release theatrical and extended cuts of these movies to make everyone happy to release only the theatrical cuts is just pathetic milking attempt i purchased the extended versions on dvd and will not purchase any lord of the rings blu ray until the extended versions are available seamless branching was invented many years ago your a bunch of idiots and community college dropout marketing department go eat seome taco bell and mcdonalds while your at it 
i really really did not like this movie saying this when almost all the other reviews are well written explanations of why this movie deserves stars is very difficult indeed nevertheless after seeing this movie i felt very disappointed i am a fan of both fantasy and science fiction and i read and enjoyed to some extend one of the books in the lord of the rings series so it is not that i just dislike fantasy sci fi the reason i disliked this movie is that when i saw it in the theaters i almost fell asleep there was no dramatic tension at all although i have to admit the opening sequences were very good and the special effects and scenery were great i would claim that the filmmakers got totally carried away with special effects once the hobbit and company started fighting computer generated monsters i grew less and less interested until i was at the point of walking out of the theater i mean i have nothing against fighting in movies especially fighting with well done special effects but enough is enough after a point there is no more excitement and it becomes monotonous and dull honesty the sad thing about movies today is that the reliance on special effects has led to a decline in the quality of the other aspects of the film such as dialogue creativity etc etc in my opinion there is nothing interesting in watching hours of computer generated fighting scenes come on where is the excitement in that in addition to the excessive fighting i feel that this movie was badly acted in one scene there was a close up on the hobbits face after somebody was killed the fact that i dont remember who shows how much i really cared at that point and the whole theater began laughing out loud i dont think that this was the desired effect somehow anyhow this is only my personal opinion after viewing the movie i felt that it was very bad due to the excessive fighting and subsequent lack of creative dialogue character development etc etc and poor acting hollywood really needs to go back to watching some classic movies which did not use any special effects because it seems that filmmakers have lost the ability to entertain audiences without massive doses of sepcial effects and even worse as proved by this movie sometimes even special effects cannot make a dull movie interesting 
i am so tired of seeing mediocre releases of movies why cant the company release the extended and much better versions of these films on blu ray what is the hold up i will not buy another version of these films period stop wasting my time and release the ones that the rest of the public want 
this is an absolutely needless release a release that only has one reason for being and one alone to make you spend your money on it before the vastly superior extended versions are released separately i kind of understood why they were separate when it came to the dvd versions as neither the data capacity or features of blu ray were available at the time making seamless branching impossible thats not the case here they could simply release both versions and have the extended bits added seamlessly depending on which version you pick or if thats not feasible just release it on a second disk instead youll end up paying for both yet again dont fall prey to it your dvd version will suffice until a proper bd is released unless of course youre the kind of person who thinks george lucas is a generous guy for allowing you to buy different versions of the same trilogy 
let me accept the fact that lotr is my most beloved film and i already own the extended editions of the films in one set im really not surprised to see new line coming up with another edition of the trilogy with films like these they will squeeze the collectors as much as they can still inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped costa botes documentaries my advise to anyone buying lotr for the first time is do not buy this set spend a little more and you get all the movies in full dts ex glory alongwith hours of endless in depth bonus features which probably youll spend rest of your life watching please be aware these new editions do not contain dts tracks no commentary tracks by the director weta workshop or the cast all you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc and nothing else it would have been a better idea had new line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again and even this is not the end once the hd format gains a little more acceptance theyll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy beware extended edition set is the ultimate lotr experience in terms of films or bonus features go get it its worth all the money spent 
i wish amazon would not put these reviews up here for the blu ray as they are for the reguklar editions and give no credence to this release on blu ray we all know about the other issues of this film what we need here and what apparently amazon does not is that the reviews here need to be only for the blu ray issue not the regular one lets get thing going right here amazon and start only putting reviews up that are relevant to the release that is on the screen here which in this case is blu ray and we know the listing is incorrect here to as there are not discs in the blu ray set only 
the only praise i will give peter jackson in his films is the beauty of his backgrounds and special effects his adaption of the story and its characters is apalling however true tolkiens masterpiece is lengthy by anyones standards and incorporating it word for word into a movie is an impossible feat i never expected that he wouldnt have to cut things from the movie that were in the book such as the hobbits adventures with tom bombadil it is not what peter jackson cut that bothered me it is what he added he changed aspects of the story unecessarily and changed characters personalities for example he placed arwen in an earlier part of the story and she stood with frodo at the ford of bruinen against the morgul lord and his host this was unneccessary and it robbed frodo of one of his most important moments in the story he was a sheltered soft hobbit who had never set foot out of the shire before and yet he manages to stand alone against the black riders and defy them it was one of those moments that proved his bravery and gave insight into his character and it is ruined by throwing arwen in there unneccessarily he robs frodo of another poignant moment when he has all the company tell him to leave on his own to mordor in the end of the movie in the book frodo chose to go on his own in secret so he would not put his friends into further danger why did this point have to change it certainly wasnt to make the story easier to follow it was a change that didnt have to be made when actual parts of the story are cut in order to make additions of this sort i get disgusted jacksons treatment of the characters in some cases bothered me as well in the story aragorn was a capable and noble character there was no mention that he was afraid of making the same mistake as his ancestor isildur in regards to the ring in the movie he was always second guessing his resolve and his ability and this diminished his character drastically gimli he made into a rash hot headed dwarf who was of no more use than as a comedic extra but in the book it was mentioned more than once that he was courteous in his speech and gave thought to his words quot it is said that the skill of the dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues yet that is not true of gimli quot true there was tension between the dwarves and the elves but in the movie that was greatly overblown these are just a few of many changes i could mention many of these alterations took away from the story the characters and the original magic of the books and they could have been easily avoided if jackson had given more thought to the rendition of the story rather than the intricacy of his special effects many people would say that needless alterations such as these are minor and dont matter much and thats a shame i would not recommend this movie to anyone but i urge anyone and everyone to read the books the lord of the rings is classic literature and this hollywood knock off falls far short of the actual story tolkien wrote 
i want the extend editions and the theatrical releases in one collection on blu ray why do we have wait more years booooooooooooooooooo i will not buy this no i wont you can not try to shove it down my throat 
dont buy this blu ray the studio is holding back the extended version from us its a rip off 
ridiculous theyre trying to gouge the consumer again just like they did with the dvds blu rays technology makes it dirt simple to incorporate the theatrical and extended editions both in the same release with a title menu option the studio choose to ignore and anger their customers by trying to sell the same movie to us twice to make a few extra bucks shameful display and no excuse for it fantastic movies but ill wait for the extended editions thank you very much 
movie epic legendary awsome award winning that said new line releasing a theatrical version in blu ray of lotr is just plain insulting i really hope people wouldnt be buying this version so new line can feel the pain how does that saying goes fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me maybe if they sell it for then i might think twice again people please dont buy this version 
most times im very wary of extended edition sets i regard them as a cynical attempt to extort money from enthusiasts who had to buy the theatrical version first for instance i dont have any interest in previews of films ive already seen nor do i see why i should pay for game advertisements and i dont want to look at a blurred grainy gallery of stills that look like nothing more than frame grabs occasionally however the extended sets do offer features worth having insights worth sharing and extended material worth watching so it is with the lotr i have bought all three of the platinum series extended edition dvd and i rejoiced in watching every minute of content i did skip the figurines however so now im waiting for the bluray equivalent it appears im going to have a long wait peter jackson apparently had a falling out with the studio so i think its a fair guess that this set is a cobbled together attempt to make money without adding much of anything to the theatre edition experience this set seems to equate to the two disc sets sold before the extended edition disc sets the only real addition would be the digital copies available on the last discs to put this in perspective the theatrical edition of the return of the king is minutes the extended version is minutes in my honest opinion the film shouldve gone to the theatre at minutes if this set was a bargain basement price id say go ahead but its not so ill wait forever if necessary i needs my precious 
theatrical versions only for that much money it is totally feasible to include both versions in this set and can we please have an extended edition on one disc when the dvd was release with both theatrical and extended editions i had assumed the logic would be to have the entirety of each movie dedicated to their own side not half and half stop ripping us off they wouldnt let me put star but i would if i could 
teach the studios a lesson not to rip us off with all these poor standards in blu ray transfers the extended version is times better than this theatrical version plus it is already out on dvd just buy the dvd version and tell blu ray to go pound sand 
this is a review for the product not for the films or filmmakers themselves to the people most likely pr shills that say some people may prefer the theatrical edition ok so new line should release the theatrical and the extended editions at the same time or provide a box set that has both there is no other explanation other than money making grab by new line go quote from the extended edition page the lord of the rings extended editions is scheduled to be released on blu ray in or two year delay money grab from fans if they can release current movies in less than months there is no excuse for new line not to publish the blu ray lotr extended editions at the same time or at least in the same year thanks for giving the lotr fans the finger new line i imagine with the quality of work put into lotr the blu ray version will be even more amazing and i look forward to watching them however i will bide my time and stand with the rest of consumer base who vote with our dollars 
i had originally pre purchased this item not realizing that it was the theatrical versions as soon as i realized that i immediately cancelled the order ive waited this long i guess i can wait another couple of years shame on them 
they will not see a single dime on this people that are into blu ray typically are more invested in their entertainment than those that only buy dvds it is not a knock on dvd buyers but rather just that if you dropped the cash for the blu ray player and the extra money on the disks then chances are you also have a tv and sound system to get the max value from your investment now i know a lot of people that also invest like that but still only use a dvd player the difference is that a much higher percentage of those into blu ray go all out to those only into dvds with that said the blu ray community expects more for their investment after spending a small fortune for their entertainment center they want the best products with all the bells and whistles for lord of the rings to come out just plain jane with nothing extra and knowing full well that the good version will be released at a laster date we have a right to be upset and to those that say these reviews are not valid i disagree they are very valid since this product falls short of what it should be and consumers need to be warned but chances are most blu ray lovers already know to avoid this release and hopefully the studios get the message this release is a slap in the face to fans of this series sit back and watch as this one goes down in flames for shafting the fans 
i am in agreement we will all go out and buy the regular edition and a few months later bam here the extended edition i waited out the war between blu ray and hd dvds and will do the same here stop milking us 
all i can say is they are going to lose a ton of money unless they press a very small number of discs if this review thread in any way reflects the general publics feelings im a big fan of the trilogy i saw both versions once a week every week they were in the theater and got three different versions of the dvds but like the vast majority of people here im going to wait for the ees i may even wait to buy them used just so warners and pj dont profit fitting punishment i say who cares if theyre being upfront about screwing the fans for a second double dip how about just once giving the fans what they want and keeping them happy 
lotr is a cinematic feast we like to enjoy every year during the christmas season while we have been waiting eagerly for the hi def version to come out like legions of other fans we will continue to wait until the extended versions are released before buying the new format 
why would anyone buy bluray version of a movie with no extras in it is beyond me the extended version of the movie is not included in this version extended versions had the best scenes i wouldnt pay for cost of high definition if i am not going to get extras 
i dont get it seriously even after a release date delay they are still going through with making the theartical versions available st what happened to giving legendary films like this the star treatment like wizard of oz got common guys i think the voices of the consumer have spoken and spoken quite loudly extended cut or no go stop being greedy and give the fans who put food on your tables what we really want and thats the extended cuts i seriously hope the greed of this company backfires on them and they loses money on production cost since these items wont sell 
i am so sick of studios releasing a hundred different versions of movies theatrical versions director s cuts special editions etc its not fair to the consumer and we need to stand together and refuse to spend our money the lord of the rings has already been bought twice in standard dvd both versions by myself and im sure by all of you this is an insult to the fans of this masterpiece and i believe we should begin by blaming peter jackson for even allowing a bluray theatrical version of this film to be released i wont be buying it and i hope everyone feels the same way 
i can wait a couple years for the good version i am signed up for notification when the extended versionis released by then if people are foolish enough to buy this version the one i want will be cheaper or not in hd and on the new tv technologies i may not evern want it in or we will see guess the recession reduced their pots to millions instead of billions i dont want to provide their tarp money poor things 
im not getting ripped off like the many versions of the star wars trilogy im waiting till the extended version comes out on blue ray 
seriously all this hate over the extended non extended at least they are up front about that and tell you on the package what really stinks are these awful transfers these films look really bad in hd the cgi work looks really poor in this much detail check any review on any blu ray website they all agree transfers are very poor better than dvd yup but not worth nearly this much money especially when you factor in the extended version debate 
ive recently been re viewing my extended editions and was wishfully thinking wouldnt it be nice if these came out in high definition it might finally give me a reason to upgrade to an hd player and tv then i follow a random link to this and find the puny theatrical edition whats the purpose im gonna wait until the extended editions come out as to all the added filler er excuse me features i could really give a rats patootie especially to have them in hd game trailers yoiks to be honest my fantasy of a high def release was a simple minimal edition of the extended films themselves cutting out all or most of the extras not a whole mess of new extras well thats ok i couldnt really afford the new equipment now anyway 
thats wright this is not the one the extended version dont buy wait for the other one 
one of my very favorite movie trilogies ever the people have spoken new line release extended although reading our reviews will add little to no impact on what new line does but its still worth a shot 
dont buy this wait for extended version message to new line release the extended version asap 
im with everyone else here completely tired of getting ripped off again and again so the theatrical version only bds can sit in the bin with the lotrs lunchboxes paperweights bookends and pantyliners i can wait ive waited this long unbelieveable isnt it do not buy this bd hold out for the real deal extended version bds 
extended cut and only the extended cut is worth buying if the theatrical release comes with that i dont mind but spending money on this version is just not reasonable especially when some of us own more than editions in standard dvd format 
most of the people that are fans have bought the extended versions on dvd and many also have the theatrical releases on dvd we should get a total package that includes both theatrical and extended versions on blu ray since the same people will be buying the same disks for a second time fans deserve a break and dont be so quick to buy with newer players being able to upgrade dvd to a near blu ray quality it wont be long before the difference is only slight 
you guys got away with this during the move from vhs to dvd laserdisc but the excuse is gone you have the material and space to release a collectors package containing the extended cut and all the extra goodies and a cheaper basic package containing just the extended cut you dont have us trapped in the corner the way you think you do tread carefully new line your fans will turn on you 
well its not april wow newline why dont you just bleed your customers to death oh you already are here by offering yet again two versions of lotr to suck the money out of your fans we can see your greed clearly 
this boxset will include theatrical version and you know the reason right thats right simply the greedy studios are planning to release later the extended editions so they can make more money out of you so its up to you people destroy this release by not buying it if their sales are low the studio is gonna realize they can fool you if you buy it anyway the studio will know they can do anything they want and youre gonna still buying their movies anyway dont buy this collection and tell others to do the same 
wait for the extended versions i bought both versions when they first came out on regular dvd but after waiting all these years for a blu ray version i can wait another year or two for the much better versions to come out 
 so i can turn my nose up at it and walk on by baby to quote monty python i fart in your general direction you wont be getting my money with this release we would like a blu ray trilogy set that includes theatrical cut and extended cut in the same set or extended set sold separately or we dont buy was that clear good stars for the films themselves for this release 
i got really excited when i saw that the lord of the rings trilogy was being release finally on blu ray until i read in the product description that the extended versions were not part of the blu ray set nine discs and no extended versions what makes matters worse is the studios included digital copies of the films as the last three extra discs like we are out there bootlegging the sorry theatrical version which we already own on dvd and do not need an extra copy of just what we need another copy of the theatrical version having owned the complete trilogy of extended versions i was hoping to clear up some shelf space by giving or selling the dvd extended versions and replacing them with the condensed blu ray set but that isnt going to happen now it truly is a shame that the studio is do this to us again just to make a buck when so many people are unemployed and the economy is in the tank 
the first time i watched the extended version of lord of the rings on dvd i was completely blown away by how much spectacular content i had missed out on i will gladly pay for the extended bluray version once it comes out but ill die before i buy this theatrical double dipping garbage 
notice i am reviewing the lotr blu ray trilogy set this is the theatrical cut wait for the set which includes the longer versions its much better also they are releasing these separate to try and get you to buy them again do not buy this set wait until the real set is made 
love the lotr movies but releasing this without the extended cuts is absolutely unacceptible this is what bluray discs were made for will not buy theses release the extended cuts together that is what all of the fans want in fact demand i hope george lucas is paying attention as well release both original and se versions of star wars saga on the same blu ray discs as well 
i absolutely love the ltor trilogy i saw them all at the theater then bought them when they came out on dvd and bought them again when they came out with the extended versions the extended versions are so much better that the theatrical versions i await the blu ray versions but if new line thinks i am going to purchase the original versions on blu ray they need to back away from the illegal substances its not going to happen i will wait for the extended versions or not purchase at all the movies have made enough to more than cover the production costs all i see now is gouging perhaps it is time i rethink if i should ever waste any money on a new line flick theater or home viewing no matter how good it appears now that it is about to be released i think ill order copies g not new line refuses to listen to us and will release the theatrical versions instead of the extended versions i wish new line well edited from my original post
i pray to god that you all will lose all sales on blu ray another hollywood gimmick 
it is almost unanimous amongst fans of this series that the extended versions are in every way superior to the theatrical releases i wouldnt think of buying them again in blu ray in any other form the original extended box set was an awesome and generous affair from the gorgeous graphics to the great look and sound of the films themselves to the amazing extras that took me weeks to go through after living with the extended versions for so long how could i ever go back to the stultifying theatrical releases answer i wont the extended cuts were how jackson meant this films to be presented and they benefit in every possible way in their longer form this does seem like a calculated way for the studios to squeeze even more dollars out of this already monumentally successful franchise judging from the negative responses up here this time it seems as if this transparently greedy ploy isnt going to fly i totally agree with the other reviewers and support not purchasing this release i am willing to wait for the real deal meanwhile i think ill cue up the extended version of fellowship in primitive dvd format should be great 
marketing gimmick to get the money for the non extended then they will release the extended version trying to get more money on those this is exactly what they did for the standard release was a rip offf then and is a rip off now at least this time we know better way to tick off your customers 
blu ray should contain both versions period i will not feed the pig with this release they ought to be ashamed of themselves 
already have extended on dvd why waste money on theatrical version blu ray while im at it how bout hurrying up with the harry potter ultimate extended editions 
i along with many others are giving a great series star to give our opinion on the theatrical version
ill wait for the extended blu ray also i bought the regular and then the extended dvds so im hooked but i will not buy the regular blu rays wait 
this is just a legal shell game and whoever buys the theatrical versions deserves to pay more later on for the full directors cuts 
i echo many of the other reviewers here as a blu ray boxed set it really should contain both the theatrical and extended versions if not that then they should at least release both versions at the same time it is a sad sad money grab to say the least i have purchased the lor trilogy twice already and will not purchase it again until the extended blu ray version comes out 
the only good news is that the people behind this release will obviously see all the negative press and know they blew it the trilogy release sans extended cuts might have been welcomed to some degree if the transfer quality was better but even on a inch hdtv these are not taking advantage of what blu ray can do on my inch projection system the quality is quite mediocre when you consider that these are not the full cuts of the movies the value shrinks to nothing just rent them and wait for the hopefully proper release meanwhile lets hope that the studios step up and really learn that sub par releases like this will have reduced profits no one i know wants to buy this for the reasons above and even casual fans walk away over the shorter cuts 
i agree with most everyone else why not give us the extended and theatrical release together in blu ray no excessive extra cost to these folks this is just exploitative peter jackson should side with the forces of light here and not let his desire for a few more dollars get in the way of doing the right thing yes its capitalism but 
those of us who care enough re buy this item on blu ray hopefully know to wait for the extended edition of the trilogy if you dont care you should you dont know what youre missing out on 
other than the lure of the almighty there was no reason for the studio to release the theatrical version on blu ray this is a massive rip off and i wont be touching this version at all i wish there was a way to give this zero stars but one is as low as i can go unfortunately epic fail 
why should anyone have to buy this trilogy on blu ray without the option to watch the series in the extended editions when the dvd versions came out in extended editions blu ray was made to hold more data and in hd so to spend on this blu ray set without the extended versions on it only to find out later on they release the extended edition on blu ray is almost stealing from the fan base and al its customers do not pre order or buy this set unless you do not mind the theatrical versions only because this is stupid and outragious for warner home video to do this to their customers release the extended editions warner home video and stop trying to make even more money when clearly you guys have already ranked in millions and millions from already re releasing the dvds i will not buy this i stand behind everyone else who agrees with me and thanks for others putting the same message out because this is unfair and a rip off 
im very glad that someone started this process im sick and tired of publishers double dipping their products the big hype about blu ray was how it could hold hours upon hours of movie and audio so why the are we seeing this theatrical release only version of lotr wheres the extended versions that are out there i know where they are theres sitting in the warehouse waiting for the sales of this version to drop off then guess what theyll pop those out here and ask us to buy them again and never admitting that they could have fit them onto the same disk they just charged us for this is nonsense and i urge every lotr fan to not buy this slap in the face packaged in a blu ray box 
i couldnt wait for this trilogy to become available on blu ray and yet here it is and i will stand my ground and not buy it sub par transfers read the reviews on no extended versions severley overpriced was a sweet spot but many retailiers only offered that for week one release now it is to depending on where you looki saw the first movie fellowship of the ring playing at a store and it is truly disappointming it looks like they took the standard dvd and slapped it on a blu ray disk and called it a day shame on the studios stand your ground and do not buy this 
another way to get your money twice shame on them i was duped the first time and bought both versions not this time they should fire their marketing advisors because i cannot imagine too many people will fall for it this time the movies are a masterpiece but still a few years old and the rush is simply not there ill wait for the extended version 
all the complaints are true do not buy this blu ray dvd wait until the lord of the rings extended version blu ray for your hard earned dollars dont give the sellers the satisfaction of knowing theyre fooling the general public 
warning warning warning do not buy this wait for the extended version of the films on blu ray the extended version trilogy on blu ray will come out right after this crappy standard version is released do not be a sucker and waste your hard earned money lets all show these money hungry film companies know we are suckers no more vote yes if you agree with this statement thank you all 
hopefully buyers are getting smarter and will not buy this insult give us extended editions new line youre not getting my double dip money this time ill wait for extended or never get the set your choice 
buyer beware for all of the boasting about how much a single blu ray disc can store here we are with only the theatrical editions of the lord of the rings films the extended editions are without a doubt the best versions to own and by not including them here confirms that this is nothing more than just a blatant cash grab safe your money for the eventual release of the extended editions in 
my wife loved these movies i was all ready to buy them for her christmas present this year until i head that the blu ray release only contained the shorter standard theater versions of these films no way will i buy two versions in blu ray these films are the perfect fare for blu ray home theater presentation but sadly i will have to wait for the studio to release the extended versions in blu ray i simply will not put out good money now when i know sooner or later theyll release the extended versions in blu ray if you loved lord of the rings dont buy these blu ray versions wait for the extended versions 
i do not own a blue ray disc or machine that said if there was one movie i would want in blue ray its the lord of the rings but dont think i would for a second buy this without it being the extended edition i really like lord of the rings and when it comes out in the extended cut i am thinking of getting a machine and the blue ray version till then ill wait why end up spending the money when they really should have put the two versions together to bad i think they made a big mistake here 
i have been buying videos and dvds for over years and i have one simple rule when it comes to purchasing movies if i already have it on regular dvd the heck with the blu ray version the only blu ray movies i buy are movies that i dont own at all when i converted over from vhs to dvd it was worth it because of the widesceen format you only have so much time in life to watch tv and your videos and play your video games stop buying stuff you already have spend your money wisely buy something youve never seen before you might discover something else thats worth watching however if you dont own these movies at all wait for the extended versions blu ray is a gimmick and with the re releases of all your favorite movies it doesnt mean you should buy everything all over again 
wow when i heard this was coming out on blu ray i just assumed that theatrical and extended versions would be included theres certainly enough room on a blu ray disc ill just watch my dvds until the extended versions are released 
i got suckered into buying the theatrical release on dvd only to get find out that later they released the extended cut editions dont bother buying this until we have the extended cut out in blu ray until then enjoy the extended cut dvd upscaled on your blu ray player 
tst tst tst im extremely disappointed in you new line you have all of these adoring fans that have made this trilogy one of the most successful movie franchise of all time and you go and do something like this you got us to buy both the theatrical and extended versions of the film on dvd and yet you dare attempt to manipulate us into doing the same thing on a new format im insulted and disgusted your greed is going to cost you it sounds like most of us our onto your little scheme and were not buying you know what the fans want give us the one blu ray release to rule them all 
unless jackson et al embellish and significantly improve upon their extended dvds by fixing a few technical glitches smoothing out just a few busy scenes with too much camera and perhaps deleting that awful unfortunate in your face the eye line by cate blanchett the selling of the lesser theatrical version in this timed fashion will come across as milking it for every consumer dollar but maybe jackson will revisit the extended versions and create a new work better than th st extendeds lets hope
ive got to agree with everyone else no doubt this will be immediately followed the full extended directors cut version and in blu ray the game of tricking people into buying these films twice needs to end we as consumers are the best entity to force a change in hollywood from this greedy and shameful practice boycott not only this attempt to tap us twice but any and all other attempts from other studios unless they can release the full extended directors cut of all films right out of the gate and they definitely can then we shouldnt cave in to their request to first purchase the shorter abbreviated versions of these films the practice of just a few months later suddenly dangling the superior version needs to end ps where the heck is star wars 
warner bros new line would be wise to put all their attention into making one stellar bluray release with both versions of the film and all previously included extras they should then supplement this package with newer extras updating fans on the lotr trilogy phenomenon hobbit film information etc by releasing this monumental movie achievement in the same piecemeal fashion they did the standard dvds new line is telling fans that they have absolutely no respect for them or the environment upon which they seem content to dump millions of unnecessary bluray discs talk about sarumans revenge warner bros execs should ask themselves what would aragorn do and react accordingly give fans everything in one pristine package charge a little more if they have to and confine the smoke blowing to gandalfs pipe 
new line wake up customers always come first i will purposely avoid your other movies now thanks 
fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me no thanks ill wait for the blu ray extended edition ee forever if need be i have the dvd ee of what i consider to be the greatest movie ever made and it upconverts nicely to a very good picture do i blame the studios no they are doing what corporate mentality is suppose to do take as much of your money as is possible and let the buyer beware in this instance however i would like to see a planet wide boycott of this rip release even if you dont care about the money care about the cause can we all pull together on this one we shall see dont buy this standard edition release if you do shame on you 
peter jackson has publicly stated that the lotr extended editions blu rays will be released to coincide with the release of the hobbit so save your money and wait for the ee blu rays the schedule is out there so its your own fault if you buy these because you do not have patience extended editions or not at all please note once the extended editions are released on blu ray i will delete this review as it would then be redundant 
is it they have not made enough money off this movie will wait for the full edition just sounds like and is greed amazon needs a no star choice star is way to high 
why would anybody want to buy blu ray editions of the theatrical version of these movies the extended versions are so much better its just money grabbing nonsense that would drive them to wait two years longer to release the versions that everybody really wants to see id sooner watch my dvds of the extended version again than i would even put this version in my netflix queue 
dont waste your time or money buying theatrical versions of this trilogy if youre going to invest almost hours for the theatrical versions you might as well add hours to that for the extended versions which in my opinion is well worth it skip this release and look for the extended versions of the dvd or wait for the extended versions of the blu ray 
i had bought the first two movies in theatrical editions when released on dvd before the extended editions were released after viewing the extended versions i gave away my theatrical versions i will wait for the release of the extended editions on blu ray as many have said this is little more than an attempt to pad the studios pockets by releasing a less desirable product in the hope that they can then sell the more desirable product later dont be surprised when they release the extended editions individually before collecting them into a trilogy 
as this is not the extended version or that all movies are included what is the incentive you already own the product this is just to take more money from you just because they can is an insult finally getting a blu ray version and this is what they are able to put out dont waste your money i am disappointed that peter jackson has agreed with this packaging 
as a consumer who already bought various copies of three different versions of this many as gifts over the years i heartily concur with the view that one should wait enjoy your dvd versions in the meantime at least youll get some value out of what you purchased previously if you want a great extended edition blu ray disc buy the new world a highly underrated film of tremendous accomplishment then be patient on lotr 
greatest movies of all time and they are trying to rip us off with the movie versions again come on give us the extra hour each as the movies were intended i am not buying these until we get the extended versions on blu ray 
i agree with everyone here that there is no reason for them to not release both the theatrical and extended versions in one package at the same time it is absolutely a money grab by the studios bad form 
i was really excited to discover they were finally going to release the lotr trilogy on blu ray then extremely disappointed to start reading the numerous reviews speaking of how only the theatrical versions will be included does new line not understand that we are coming out of an economic recession and that it has to do really good by its consumers if it wants to succeed in a failing home video market were smarting up to your archaic double dipping schemes i dont care if it means well have to wait another couple months or more if you need to delay the release to allow for the inclusion of the extended content but it has to be done if you want to see a good profit out of this release id also be extremely disappointed if the extended release if it happens turns out to be only the extended versions likely leading to a recurrence of the triple dipping done with the original dvds theatrical extended theatrical extended combo give us the option to be able to watch both versions in hd in the same set or nothing at all 
this is classic bs and the fans are finally getting wise to it the studio wants us to buy this shorter theatrical version then theyll release the extended version and expect us to spend even more money dont do it boycott this theatrical version send the bigwigs at the studio a message we are not stupid release the extend version now 
love the movies hate the money making tactics release the full length versions you villians i normally wouldnt participate in this sort of un reviewing but im just plain fed up with this sort of nonsense on the part of the movie industry 
i was so excited when i typed in lord of the rings in the blu ray section and something came up yesssssssss i could finally enjoy my beloved movies in high definition of course i became upset when i realized it had a one star rating and why theatrical version are you kidding me i do believe that it was announced before the theatrical version of the movies came out on dvd that they were working on an extended edition but you know what i only bought the t v dvds because i simply couldnt wait to see lotr again once the extended editions came out i never pulled them off the dvd shelf again not once not even by accident to me they lack the true vision of the whole that is included in the extended edition not worth my time honestly too much missing dont buy this garbage if you really want to enjoy the entire movie fully to see it in all of its stunning glory this is a complete joke and there is simply no excuse for new line to have done this aside from greed pure and simple and while i do sympathize with a studio trying to squeeze every single drop of profit off of a big hit as possible i already bought three items i did not want permanently from them the t v of lotr trilogy a lot of people did i wont bother buying again until i see the extended versions on blu ray and if theyre releasing the first three as one set wed better see the extended versions as one set also dont get all crazy breaking it up for even more profit or i just wont buy it at all out of pure anger at that point blu ray makes my dvds look good enough not to make myself bend my morals by encouraging dishonesty by rewarding it just to have more visual appeal and in my opinion new line is already toeing the line 
why would the distributor waste resources putting all the films on blu ray and only contain the theatrical versions of all three lotr films we or most of us already own the extended editions on dvd and logic would follow that the extended editions would find their way to blu ray whats the deal with reselling the theatrical versions of the lotr trilogy on blu ray and not also offering customers the option to purchase the lotr trilogy on blu ray in the extended edition form 
like many many others i am tired of being ripped off by the double dip merchandising being practiced by the entertainment media with the storage capacity of bluray there is absolutely no reason not to release both versions of the lotr saga other than dollar milking the bd ports are done and ready to go i am a die hard tolkein and lotr fan but im waiting for the bd extended editions i suggest everyone do the same and send a message 
i checked amazons entry for the extended version estimate release sometime in or years years if they have the theatrical version already in blu ray then they can release the extended version along with it and not years later ridiculous they want you to break down along the way that after watching other movies on blu ray and then re watching your extended version lotrs dvds and wishing for blu ray version youll give in and buy the theatrical version and then of course later on buy the extended version when they finally get around to releasing them i do not mind that they have a blu ray theatrical version for those who prefer that version fine great no problem but i do have a problem that they are making those of us who prefer the extended version wait years for the blu ray version when they could easily put that version out at the same time or very shortly after the theatrical version well the studio ceos will have to wait for my contribution to their second mansions i am waiting for the extended version on blu ray i love lotrs enough that i can still enjoy watching the extended version on dvds right now hard to feel sorry for studios complaining about profits when their ceos rake in multi millions not including perks and actors rake in multi millions while i have to wait years for the extended version because i just can not afford to buy every version of lotrs no matter how much i love the movie 
we want both versions of the films but if not possible then at least make the extended cut of the film available with this economy is it necessary to milk fans double times in order to get both versions of the film the movie itself i give stars but seeing the kinds of decisions being made on both the release of the picture is disappointing
why not release the entire versions theres no excuse for these abbreviated versions other than greed 
new line you people are the limit you should offer both versions i want the extended and from what im reading i am not alone that is it you know what you can do with your theatrical version i would love to show you
everyone who buy this theatrical version of lord of the rings trilogy will get disappointed buy lotr bluray on extended version do not get fooled 
what a disappointment once again new line is going to release only the theatrical version of this set first as they did with the dvds this is an attempt to make the consumer double dip wait for the theatrical extended blu ray set to come out and maybe these companies will learn 
love the movie but i will not buy it again until the bluray extended version is released at a reasonable price the one star is for the product not for the movie which is stars i urge all potential customers to wait wait wait remember the manufacturer needs us we dont need them to screw us again united we stand divided they fall there is no group in the world more powerful than the consumer if we stand together be strong they will give in sooner than we will edward erlerthe lord of the rings the motion picture trilogy theatrical editions blu ray 
greed why publish a blu ray with threatrical versions only greed because they should be either the extended only or of course both on a blu ray you didnt make enough yet shame on you we will wait for the extended 
nobody in the world would be buy this what a stupid idea have a blu ray with a not entire movie wait for the extended version iam sick to see how the industry works this time i hope so that anybody in the world buy this 
i doubt that warner pays any attention to the comments on amazon but im weighing in just the same i absolutely agree with all of the previous negative comments they really should have released the extended versions with the option of watching either sadly if you watch the sales of this set they will probably be substantial there are a lot of people who just wont be able to wait and will put out money for this package but not i 
its a shame they arent releasing the extended editions like they did with the dvds i own the extended editions and dont want to buy the theatrical editions i pretty much am now being punished since i have to wait longer even though i am willing to pay more for the better longer cuts of the movies wheres the logic unless the studios are hoping i buy this product twice in addition to the dvds i own i think thats a bit taking advantage of the consumer 
this is not a review of the films the films are great but the fact that a blu ray disc which can hold up to gb of data and new line is pulling this stunt this is not the extended version with the extras this is just the theatrical version and i am highly disappointed you think that that blu ray and lotr would be a perfect marriage and yet all we get is the theater version i say thanks but no thanks i will save my dollars for the extended version i think thats why the price is set at only give us what we want and we will pay the price for it dont give us what we want and you will pay the price for it 
the theatrical versions of lotr were great when i saw them in the theatre times each however when i heard originally that there were extended versions of each being released following the standard dvd it was the extended i waited for and was not disappointed by what i think walsh boyens jackson got right is these are movies that people who never read the book could enjoy and people who have read the book could for the most part also enjoy take into account how many movies are made from books that fail on either one or both of these points and it makes lotr movies more remarkable i understand that not everyone may get the large outcry against the theatrical blu ray because the extended editions were considered more definitive if both are good why not be happy with what we get we know there is more thats why and true there were a few things on the extended versions that could have been left out but overall the extended is the version i prefer to watch and own plus the in depth documentary for each movie beginning to end has possibly spoiled me forever on making of dvd extras i can watch those alone for hours tolkien fans that take issue with certain decisions such as myself and the changing of faramirs overall storyline can take some consolation when real acknowledgment is given to the controversy of the decisions as well as explanation of the decisions i still am not fond of the changes to faramir but i understand why it was done and why it may have been the right choice you lose that and the additional depth given for instance to faramir with the theatrical release i will hold my money and wait once more 
with blu ray they could have and should have included both the theatrical release and extended cuts in this product its obvious they are repeating the same game of trying to get people to buy the theatrical cuts then buy the extended cuts when those come out greed and idiocy combined is never a happy picture loved the movies but the way they are packaging the blu rays is a complete rip off hopefully its not too late to get them to reverse course but if it is they can choke on the unsold inventory and have similar boycotts waiting for them and their blu ray theatrical releases of the other two movies as well 
no one will by this crap blu ray is know for its high capacity so what do they do give us theatrical versions come back when you have both versions on the same disc cheap skates 
i call for a boycott of this and every other studio rip off release of great films onto any video format we got suckered with the intitial releases of our favorite movies onto dvd years ago featuring usually just a crappy transfer of the movie and maybe the theatrical trailer then six months or a year later the studio would release the uuml ber special edition with a clean crip picture and lots of goodies for three times the price of the alreday too expensive initial release and studios have been playing that game again with blu ray by releasing crappy versions of stargate terminator and total recall and then coming out with over priced special editions though were still waiting for a decent total recall bd i say no more weve been on to your game for years now you despicable corporate ringwraiths youre not the creative artists youre the sniveling mba creeps who are only in this business for the money were fans because we love these movies not because we love you boycott boycott boycott boycott 
new line could have saved a bunch of money and made a ton if they just released the extended versions with a program on the disc allowing the theatrical to be played as well sorry new line im saving my money for the extended editions that is if i care next year after waiting 
my suspicion has been confirmed im glad so many opeople agree with my opinion of this release i already own the theatrical versions in dvd and im not wasting my money on this one i was really hoping for the extended editions on blu ray which im sure will be released in a future at an exhorbitant price but im patioent i can wait until the price drops down 
i would very much like to get lotr when it comes out but would rather get the full versions ee as i have now in sd cant afford to buy both bd sets 
nine discs for movies i would buy the theatrical version if it were just blu ray discs and less expensive i am not interested in digital copy 
the hobbit is going to be released theatrically in late at least part is it will be in two parts they are holding back on the extended versions until then i have this from an insider source this really is a sucky double dip and while lotr is my all time favorite movie trilogy i will not buy this version after watching the extended versions multiple times these films would seem completely chopped up i strongly urge anyone who wants the extended versions not to get sucked into this double dip which only rewards the bad behavior we all hate there are tons of good films on blu ray now we can wait 
i agree with the previous reviewers i was pretty excited to see the release until i noticed it was the theatrical version i have the extended releases on all three films on sd for the studios not to release both versions theatrical and extended is just shameful im saving my dollars until the real thing comes out 
i did not even know there was extended version but i guess i should wait for it then thanks guys for heads up 
why would the studios do this again did they not think that lotr fans would just buy whatever they threw at us i refuse to buy another set of lotr movies and then have the extended versions released just give us the extended versions from the getgo and dont try to get even more money from me 
i bought the original dvd box set because i absolutely loved this trilogy then the extended versions came out and had what was truely missing in the first three i bought the extended box set and gave away my first set to a non lotr fan ive been dying for this trilogy on blu ray and they decide to do the theatrical editions are you nuts as you can see by the feedback we arent falling for this trick again when you release the extended version on blu ray then youll get your stars and insane high praise start working on the extended version so you can recover from this epic fail to the fans 
the extended cuts were so much more entertaining and complete i will as will so many others wait for those versions before i buy 
those monkeys are going to lose money on this one only true fans would buy this on bluray and no true fan would buy anything but the extended editions so those idiots will incur all the costs of production packaging and shipping but nobody will purchase save for grandparents mistakenly buying this for their progeny great move in a shaky economy aint nobody buying this one fools 
no way i would buy this version that only has the regular theatrical releases instead of the extended versions what a greedy rip off but maybe thats shouldnt be a surprise remember the big brouhaha a while back about new line failing refusing to pay mr jackson and company all that was due to them after completing this fantastic trilogy 
great movies poor marketing warner new line with star reviews you should take example with titles like blade runner and star trek the original series youd find a far stronger following if you just do it right the first time instead of screwing the very people that feed you we wants it we needs it must have the precious they stole it from us sneaky little hobbitses wicked tricksy false to add i will be skipping this whole release and rewatching my trusty extended versions on dvd i already put them on and they look pretty darned good 
there is absolutely no excuse for releasing a theatrical version first and then milking us again for the extended i bought them all twice already on dvd i feel stupid enough for that no way i do it again its sad they are willing to do this to loyal fans just sad call me when the extended versions are out 
i will not buy this pj and new line suits have more money than most people could ever dream of i will wait i hope this release will fail new line is soooo greedy that they are making two hobbit movies ok not anymore come on greedy b astards okay the drugs just kicked in still think this release will be a doomed failure i hope wal mart has extra shelve space for all their unsold copies 
loved the books loved the movies loved the extended editions what a waste this release is hopefully poor sales will send a message to the transparently greedy and arrogantly moronic executive who greenlit this release or perhaps to his her boss so he she can join the of us unemployed who dont have money to waste on duplicate purchases 
so were only getting the theatrical versions whoop whoop and we gotta wait at least more years before the extended versions make it to blu ray as much as i love the blu ray format i will be passing on this set as i already own both versions on dvd and paid full price back then i dont mind triple dipping if warner new line gave us both versions for one price and not make us wait more years its so sad for us fans but ill wait until the extended versions come out 
this is a fantastic trilogy for sure but come on no extended versions if anything put the extended and theatrical in the same release this is a attempt to soak the consumer twice shame on you new line dont play this game with the studio just wait for the extended versions to come out on blu ray this release gets a huge raspberry 
my favorite movies of all time the lord of the rings trilogy managed to surprise and anger me with the two phase release of first theatrical and then extended versions on dvd we have become accustomed to this marketing tactic by now and few of us are likely to be taken in again for the blu ray well wait more or less patiently for the real thing the extended edition 
this just nonsense blu ray discs can hold a ton of data why buy this when you well feel dumb when the extended version comes out just greediness just release them on one disc sheesh or at least release them separately but simultaneously they only reason they dont is to either fool us into buy this version then realizing a better version will come out and buy that version too 
those jerks really expect us to fall for this crap for the amount of money these films have made they can very much afford to release the extended versions dont they want to make more money dummies in the marketing dept i guess 
new line what are you thinking have you not heard that blu ray holds a ton more information than does regular dvd how about a theatrical and extended cut release all in one did no one think of this the true lotr fan is not going to settle for the theatrical versions i speak for every lord of the rings fan when i say this has to be the stupidest decision i have seen yet for a blu ray boxed set if you are going to do it do it right i will not purchase this set i will not purchase a lotr set in the blu ray format until it is released in the previously stated much better extended versions i predict you may sell units of this worldwide while the rest of us wait for a real release on blu ray that is worthy of the format more storage space means you can fit the whole extended cut on one disc have i said enough yet 
im jumping on the bandwagon and dropping a star rating for new line warner for so blatantly double triple and quadruple dipping on hard working folks in the middle of the worst economic times since the great depression shame on you greedy b st rds that said bring on the extended cuts 
like everyone else im holding out until the extended edition is released way too much is missing from the theatrical release to make it of any interest for any decent lotr fan and theres no way in hell im paying for the same film twice try again newline 
new line cinema must be absolutely insane how can they not release the extended edition do they expect people to buy this and then buy the double priced directors cut in a couple years this is a complete ripoff and i hope people dont buy this set 
they want us to buy the theatrical editions now and then buy the extended editions later no way blu ray movies are too expensive to double dip like this dont waste your money on the theatrical editions make them release the extended edition 
this is a fraud they could include both versions bluray has the capability for it but no they only care about money their money not yours im sick and tired of the studios trying to screw the consumer with this kind of politics not anymore im gonna wait for the extended editions 
why on earth would anyone spend some on this set when for about more you can get the quality dvds if you read the specs on both editions youll see that these do not have the same level of restoration directors commentary and you have to turn the disks over at inopportune points obviously everyone should make the decision for themselves but i cant really understand why this cheaper edition would sell any copies 
it is bad enough that i own both theatrical and extended but i too am not falling for the theatrical blu ray to quote network im mad as h and im not going to take it anymore at least i seem to recall it that way i mean i do work for a living and am not a bottomless money pit 
who would ever bother with the theatrical versions of these movies i mean weve been to paris the extended versions why would we go back to the farm i can jusify the double dip in regular dvd up to a point but now it just looks like greed i wonder if theyre doing this to pay off the lawsuits from everyone and their cousin in law who sued new line over profits points and residuals that they refused to pay ill order buy the extended versions the minute they come out though why they have to wait until is beyond me peter jackson and richard taylor cant be that busy can they but great picture and sound or not i wont even think about this set one star 
no one wants the regular editions now that the extended exist put them out simultaneously or only put out the extended edition 
the title of my review says it all wait for the extended version while i wont criticize them for trying to make as much money as they can it is well within their right i think it is a bit silly to release a theatrical version first and an extended version two years later especially since both are already available on dvd release both at the same time and let the consumer decide which one he or she would like to purchase i personally will wait the two years and get the extended edition 
this is shameful an inexcusable that the studio is not including the extended cut versions 
it really makes no sense to release the lotr trilogy on blu ray in this format the studio really needs to reconsider its position and release a version of the trilogy on blu ray that includes not only the theatrical versions but also the extended versions it is abundantly clear by the reviews on amazon that most fans would rather live with their extended dvd editions than pay for truncated blu ray theatrical versions the bean counters made a big mistake on this one the bosses wont be happy when this blu ray hits the market it will be a colossal flop 
just a few weeks ago a friend and i were having a beer before we headed in to a ball game for what ever reason we brought up how great this trilogy was and that most likely they will release the crappy theatrical version first on blue ray so they can double dip with the extended version ill be watching my dvd version until you stop trying to screw us 
blade runner and dark city both new line warner releases use technology called seamless branching which allows for multiple versions of a movie to appear and be played back on the same disc without having redundant scenes taking up space this means that there can easily be the theatrical edition included with separate scenes from the extended cut that could be plugged in when appropriate if that option were selected there is absolutely no conceivable reason why this blu ray shouldnt give fans that feature instead they want to screw consumers yet again in another sad attempt to release multiple versions and cash in on the property making you pay more swap discs and taking up more space in your collection and if you want the full experience as a fan i prefer the extended cuts but as a newcomer it is much better to experience the slimmer theatrical cuts first considering the movies made about a billion dollars collectively they cant possibly be worried about poor sales for that possible ultimate edition at least on dvd they actually said there would be extended editions before the theatricals were released but on dvd there were technology limitations which made a believable excuse that excuse just doesnt fly anymore you can pretty much guarantee the extended cuts will be released at some point and for theres absolutely no reason to upgrade especially since theyre screwing you in the special features department as well the dvds still look great upscaled and sound great so ill stick with that until they make it worth my while 
studios please listen to us the customer and stop trying to make us double dip work on a great transfer stop coming out with multiple versions of the same film over and over just to squeeze money from the fans pockets since new line warner bros already has the extended cuts in their possesion why not release those first the extended cuts were so much more entertaining and complete i will as will so many others wait for those versions before i buy stop the double dip greed 
ill wait for the extended version not paying twice for this movie sorry new line no sale this time the movies by the way are fantastic stars 
many lotr fans were burned a few years ago when they rushed to buy the theatrical versions on dvd only to see the extended versions offered a short time later dont get burned again by greedy movie studio execs im hoping that pre sales will be so dismal that they decide to relent and replace this with the version that fans deserve 
the the price of blu ray im going to have to wait to the extended edition cant afford to double dip
just another way of the film industry ripping off the consumer dont buy it wait for the extended release 
this is horseradish george lucas does the same thing and will again when they finally release star wars on blu ray they always release the plain jane verion early to make a couple of bucks initially and then come out with the special editions later they know theres idiots just like me who will buy it twice theres plenty enough room on blu ray to store both versions on one disc but we know their one and only concern and its not you and me the star wars dvd fiasco is a perfect example how many different releases were there three i think i bought two and wasnt happy with either all i wanted was remastered versions of the original films but what i got was took its my fault george lucas doesnt care about the average fan he just wants to controll everything and make sure he squeezes every penny out of us ive seen it before and should have known better this lord of the rings set is the same thing they will milk us for as much as they can and then release the special editions they know were all waiting for 
id have gone for a double dip if this had come out years ago but ive waited this long i can keep on waiting for the inevitable deluxe extended version im sure the suits at the studio think this is a profit maximizing strategy and can probably point to the dvd sales as evidence but there is a difference people bought the dvd the first time because there simply was nothing else no other lotr to watch at home then they got the deluxe version because of all it offered none of us are going to do it again especially not in these trying financial times because this time we already have the dvd version which was an awesome encode and looks phenomenal on my front projector at so i dont need it and ill wait for a proper version bottom line if you plan to double dip get the first version out quick cause once people know they can live without it they will oh and yeah the d version will probably be coming down the road so if you take too long ill just keep waiting 
this is blatant greed wait until the extended versions come to blu ray before you waste your money double dipping at its worst 
boo to new line releasing just the theatrical versions on blu ray is like spitting directly in the faces of your fans fans that are rabid for this stuff and have given you millions of dollars at least this lets me keep an eye out to avoid buying any other new line releases 
why the heck would anyone waste their money on this halfass collection stop wasting our time and just give us the real thing some of us fell for it once so you guys figure you should take us for fools again do not buy this 
its not up for discussion whether or not the studio is duping you or not they are theyre giving us the bare bones here they want your money and youre probably going to give it to them because youre unaware dont care too impatient that aside the thing is that a lot of people will be just completely satisfied with the theatrical versions i see it every day at the store i work at where people by the disc tin cased theatrical version mini box for mind you they could have the sweet extended box for but that extra for an hour more footage just doesnt matter to them they didnt see it in the theater so why would they need to see it now the fact is though that those extra minutes in every book turn a great film trilogy into a legendary film trilogy and for those of us in the know this blu ray edition will simply not suffice theres no word on when the extended editions will come out but when they do then i will be making the purchase if its of any interest to blu ray enthusiasts people who really enjoy the benefits of hi gh definition lossless surround sound p picture bd live supplements etc then id like to direct you to many websites whove had the opportunities to review this box already youll find that most do not give this outstanding grades in the visual department in fact most say its average if not slightly better than up scaled dvds only slightly improving as the trilogy moves on the audio is at least pretty solid from what ive read actually improving as the series goes on return usually getting star audio reviews for me though i want this to be as near flawless as possible and i think the viewing public whove dumped so much money into this trilogy already deserve nothing but the best that can be offered so again i will be waiting i want the best not the bare bones and not sub par transfers for a hi def format id recommend people not shell out for this until it has been made as close to benchmark blu ray status as possible and this simple theatrical version will not suffice for me anyway and for the people who feel the same way so far 
ive been a fan of lor for a long time and have bought three different versions of the dvds ive been waiting for bluray hd dvd release ever since ive gotten my hd set up ready and thinking that this time ill have the ultimate version of them all one version to rule them all just like the matrix this theatrical editions release has no point at all and is a major dissapointment 
i add my one star i would give if possible just for the statistics i guess theyre gonna sell quite a few copies of the theatrical edition anyway but for me its extended edition or nothing 
why would they release the theatrical version when the extended cuts are far superior i dont know they would waste their time and money on giving us this lesser version and to be honest i dont know why i would waste my time and money either from what i hear the studio wants to wait until the hobbit comes out to let us own the lotr trilogy on blu ray in the extended cut poor decision 
maybe now that the buying public is finally on to the stupid studio ploys to trick customers into multi buys when this thing doesnt sell we can get a real package heck weve waited this long whats another few months until they release the extended versions anyways dont do it corporate film companies trying to take your hard earned money through trickery 
i will echo the sentiment of others and say that this is a blatant attempt by new line to get you to double dip when the extended cuts are released on blu ray send a message to the studio and boycott this release 
when lotr theatrical dvds were released i read an article online about the extended book editions coming months later and i waited for those and i told people at best buy etc in line to reconsider their purchases it is simply a joke they are doing this again with the power of blu ray how hard is it to put out one version and allow the viewer to decide between theatrical extended cuts if anybody buys this you are telling them you are a this should sell zero copies noah
i never issue ratings based on the package instead of the movie itself but in this case im making an exception putting out the theatrical version on blu ray instead of the extended is just dumb the chain of logic is simple blu ray owners will tend more towards being cinemaphiles than non blu ray most cinemaphiles already own the extended version lotr on dvd and probably the theatrical version too since it came out first the extended versions are overwhelmingly better than the theatrical the additional material is not just something scraped off the cutting room floor they significantly enhance the movies no cinemaphile already owning the extended version is going to drop back to the theatrical i dont care if it is on blu ray ill never watch the theatrical version again ill re watch the extended on dvd dvd isnt that bad the big concern is the theatrical blu ray release will bomb because all of us serious lotr fans would rather continue watching the extended will this lead them to think theres no demand for lotr on blu ray and therefore not release the extended that sounds kind of dumb but then theyre the same people making this bonehead move in the first place 
hopefully someone was fired over the decision not to make these blu ray versions extended if not after poor sales hopefully they will be 
man so frustrating i really want to have the lotr in blu ray probably the best movies to show off this format but after seeing the extended versions why would you want the theatrical i am not buying it ill wait and even if they never put out the extended on blu ray i still wont buy these i purchased all the dvds of lotr and i wont get duped again i already will never again buy any george lucas movies again on any format he has eaten away enough of my money i am sure when he puts star wars out on blu ray he will come out with the special editions and then a year later the originals he sucks anyway cant make a movie anymore his best movie ever was the empire strikes back and thats because he didnt direct it i understand that these are companies and first and foremost they make money and i have no problem buying there product as long as its good but come on so here my one star for the cause wait for the extended versions 
i love these movies but i know ill want the extended editions so ill pass on the theatricals hopefully new line will bring out the full version on blu ray soon 
yes finally on blu ray but sadly they are double dippin this dont buy the plain jane theatrical version wait for the platinum extended cut to add to your collection jackson should be ashamed of himself for doing this greedy little punk 
edit pst amazon had to lower the price by fifteen dollars dont fall for it wait for the extended version if the price of this gets to twenty buck ill pick one up till then im out id give this item zero stars if it was possible this is exactly what other star reviews have called it a blatant money grabbing venture by new line first the absolute worst of the two hd formats wins the war because of crummy ps popularity admit it bd java sucks now we get invited to spend beaucoup bucks on a second class edition edit also the pq of the dvds is so excellent why bother paying for bd pq until the extended version is released 
i consider the extended editions to be the definative lotr i wont spend a penny on anything less 
i am one of those buyers that love blu ray as a format but have zero tolerance for double dipping by the studios who have no respect for the average consumer yes id give a star review for the films but only for the best version of the films available the extended cuts we all already have the extended cuts of the film on standard dvd and all agree that its well worth it to buy that version over the shorter theatrical versions why would we downgrade from what we already own do not buy this version send a clear message to the studios that were tired of this and we the consumers are not going to deal wth this type of behavior anymore we will save our hard earned money and hold out for the product we the consumers want the extended cuts of the film on blu ray and nothing less and make no mistake folks a little patience will go a long way to save you money as just like the standard dvd releases they will eventually release the extended cuts of the film on blu ray but only after theyve milked the suckers out of their money for those who must own any version of the film on blu ray asap but dont settle and dont be cheated you work too hard for your money to spend it twice hold out for the real versions of this film only then maybe the studios will get the message 
i couldnt agree with many of you more that feel the movie industry or whatever money hungry enterprize is behind this release that i for one along with about yes other family and friends will boycott this release we will purchase the extended blu ray version when and if that release comes out we can wait until then 
they know we want the extended versions and they know that the blu ray format is more than capable of delivering both the extended and theater versions on a single gb bd disc while still having excellent picture and sound instead though we are asked to shell out for this and then shell out for the super duper extended version in another year or two when the hobbit movie releases vote with your wallets people just say no to this crap 
i really love the movies and will buy the extended version no way i am giving the studio my money twice again im happy to watch my standard dvds until the extended blu rays come out please dont buy this version and encourage the studios to pull this bull t again 
if they released these excellent films on vhs i wouldnt buy that format either why buy this edition 
we have waited all this time for this crap i will wait five more years if i have to but i will not buy this version i rather watch it on dvd upscaled by my br player 
im just adding my voice to the thousands of others who want the extended editions released 
how about releasing the extended addition with an option to view the theatrical versions instead of the marketing strategy of hoping everyone will repeat history by buying both 
i am not part of some group that is organizing a petition on this topic or anything i am just a regular person who saw that lotr was coming out on blu ray and then realized it was only the theatrical version that is bs it clearly is a move to double and tripple dip into the pockets of fans no matter what spin they may try to put on it no way i will be buying the theatrical version ill just deal with my upconverted regular dvd versions like others i already own both versions on dvd i am not interested in owning both versions on blu ray i just want the extended version or nothing 
dittos to all above wait for bd extended sets tell new line with your wallet to stop screwing the fans over 
wait for the extended version the rich is just robbing the consumer let your buying power dictate the market 
do the studios think we are that stupid that we will shell out too much money for a theatrical release then shell out more money for what we really want the extended release anyone who wastes their money on the theatrical release alone is not only retarded but accomplishes nothing except to encourage the studios to continue this practice people do what i will do and rent it for free from blockbuster i am a blockbuster online member and will rent this one as a free return 
w p bluray you really dont need bluray discs anyway you cant even tell the difference between a bluray disc and a standard disc after a blueray player upscales a standard disc too lotr should only put released on the extended edition anything less is a ripoff 
i normally do not approve of posting any kind of review before a product is released but i am making an exception for new lines greedy release of the theatrical versions of lotr i join with all other fans of this franchise in voicing my extreme disgust that new line would try to rip us off with the release of only the theatrical versions of these films i will not be purchasing this trilogy on blu ray until the preferred extended editions are available until then i will be quite content with my complete set of extended dvds 
 stars for the movies star for your lousy buisness tactics and its not just this release its done for most cult movies all across the board and im not falling for it again ill wait and wait and wait lets make an example out of this movie 
i cant imagine why the original theatrical versions of these films even matter at this point its the extended versions that everybody wants and its the extended versions that this particular blu ray zealot will wait for 
im a huge lord of the rings fan am only giving this star because of the bone headedness of the production studio for rereleasing the theatrical versions in blu ray and not the extended versions there is no waaay i would purchase the theatrical versions after seeing and purchasing the extended versions as far as im concerned the theatrical versions are the abridged versions of the films this makes no sense whatsoever 
thanks but no thanks new line i had to buy dvds already and blu rays are far too pricey to make us double dip shame on you i hope everyone boycotts buying these rip off theatrical blu rays and you lose a lot of money because of it judging by the over negative comments on this set already despite the fact that it still hasnt even been released yet my dream may come true you have a lot of nerve doing that to a group of extremely loyal diehard fans you will taste our nerdy wrath 
hey guys dont fall for this crap not only did they release these great movies about times on dvd but now they want to milk blu ray owners ugh avoid and wait for the extended editions i hate greedy studios 
i am in full agreement that the blu ray version should be the extended versions this is poor form indeed the economy is sluggish not a good time to fleece your fans 
this is the difference between a mediocre film filled with plot holes and a grandiose viewing extravaganza they are out of excuses on the blu ray not to release both versions at the same time the blame went so many ways before the theaters want it shorter the audiences wants it shorter the extra scenes are not ready etc enough bs no one complained about the green mile its clear now its just pure greed to release the kia before the mercedes benz and not both at the same time special note for the obvious few that think its too long they have added a new feature to blu ray its called a pause button they claim it can even stop the movie while you go pee my cousin claims it always existed but that cant be true because that would make people less than intelligent if they complained it was too long so just wait for the damn extended edition please 
 the studio execs decided to try to make fools of us once again dont let them be patient and get the extended editions which should be released with the theatricals as a single package similar to the spectacular blu ray of close encounters of the third kind 
there is no way that anyone will fall for this gimmick again everyone is waiting for the extended editions stop being greedy new line 
despicable behavior by the studio theres no excuse here just pure greed do not support this behavior 
i concur with all of the others dont sell the same groceries twice in different bags follow the advice given by all of these amazon reviewers and offer extended versions more special features and whatever else it takes to justify the expense the same goes for all of the other re releases wheres the beef 
anyone who enjoyed this trilogy knows that the extended version of this trilogy are superior to the theatrical versions only reason they are releasing the theatrical version of this trilogy is to make some quick bucks i agreed with others on this matter avoid buying this product since anyone who is willing to spend that much money on this version will end up buying the extended version anyway your money but i prefer to keep my until its needed 
seriously this re release crap has got to stop you are rich as hell why do you insist on squeezing every penny out of us this is the exact reason people buy bootleg dvds you guys are crooks 
i already got version on dvd you want me get another version on blu ray come on it is a great movie but why you want to torture your fans 
i am shocked they are releasing this without the extended version i have the dvds at home that have both theatrical and extended right on the same disk why cant they do that here with blu ray damn money hogs they are just trying to squeeze every cent they can well please dont buy this set its not worth it at all you are literally flushing your money down the toilet shame shame shame on this release now i understand why peter jackson hates dealing new line cinema i have lost all respect to them forget the loyalty to the fans lets squeeze them for every penny instead nuff said 
you fooled me once when you released fellowship of the ring theatrical edition on dvd only to release it again several months later in an extended version package fooled me once yes but the next installments had me grinning and rocking on my heels before the extended versions were released in a similar fashion now youre trying the same thing on blu ray no i wont even buy it if there was a threat that the extended editions were never to be released on blu ray give us the extended versions on blu ray or nothing at all the extended versions were definitely the way the movies were intended to be seen especially the scene with saruman in return of the king theatrical saruman goes poof dont be fooled people and dont let new line make idiots of us again 
first i was surprised to see barely stars for this movie by over reviewers but then it made me curious to see why has it been such low profiled by the reviewers because this is one my all time favorites movies what an eye opener all these reviews are its not about the movie but about the dvd edition i agree with all the reviewers after all this long wait its not worth paying of blu ray dvd which is not extended version of the movie this is really a rip off i will better wait for extended version of the blu ray rather than paying for this version all these reviews are good eye opener thanks everyone its worth rating star for blu ray edition of the movie but my stars to these great movies 
having not been suckered into the theatrical versions in standard dvd format i will not be suckered into it through blue ray either after the amazing extended editions why would anyone want actually want to see the standard editions waiting for the extended blue ray wont wont wont bother wasting my time with the standard versions 
i agree back during the hd dvd blu ray wars i remember that these were announced on hd dvd with the extended cut offered on blu ray after hd dvd bit the dust both were quickly withdrawn hey guys in case you didnt know you can include both versions on one disc as so many other movies have done with seamless branching boooooo i already bought these twice on dvd now twice on blu ray 
there is absolutely no way i am being duped into buying this twice in first theatrical and then extended editions show some integrity and include both in one package 
you mean the disc dvd set of the extended editions wasnt good enough as in reference quality dvds here it gets worse the three discs of this set are digital copy discs that means rd of this set will eventually expire and be useless well im sure theyll make nice lotr coasters for your cold beverages now i know that new line is on hard times but this is simply insulting in regards to an obvious cash grab 
despite the hype and boosterism br is not in good health sales of the discs were a paltry million for vs billion for dvd est tbr on those are the kind of numbers that would ordinarily get a product pulled from the market but the big holdout is hoping everyone will will re buy all their dvds on br not likely when people are losing their jobs and houses faster than ever and people see these kind of schemeseven vod has left br in the dust at billion sales q composite est in this economy br has not flourished and thanks to stupid tricks like this we know why warner is guilty of several anti br moves over the past year the ceo bod should all be on the unemployment linesthe public has to trust that this is not just another way to grab their money and this looks exactly like that dont just blindly assume that br will work out and be on your merry waystopping stupid moves like this is one way to make sure that it does
big mistake boys big mistake other than sheer corporate greed or a need to validate p t barnums claim that a sucker is born every minute there is no excuse for not releasing the extended editions of the lord of the rings on blue ray i have eagerly awaited the release of these films on blue ray but not the theatrical editions now i will have to settle for the pleasure in knowing that i am one among countless fans who will not spend a penny on these versions in fact i will prbobably not even rent these discs until new line does the right thing by releasing the extended editions on blue ray i urge everyone else to do the same someone will feed these corporate weasels but it wont be me 
new line hopes to sell the theatrical release and then shear usagain for the extended release not my money 
yes one star for this stereo typical studio tactic initially releasing only the theatrical versions until sales have dwindled to nothing and then we get the new and improved product that they had waiting under their wings the whole time holding out on us huh why i otta i strongly recommend that you and i the customers eliminate this pathetically transparent double your money making sleazy tactic and not repeat not purchase these releases we have the money they want our money we have the power to stop this greedy tactic by being smart enough not to keep buying into this do we want to complain or do we want to finally take a stand what could be simpler just dont buy it im not 
whatever you do do not buy this release or rent it new line should be ashamed of themselves for releasing the theatrical edition with blu ray they had a responsibility to release the extended edition of this film series they should have just included both versions in this release instead we get the usual hollywood crap of forcing fans to double buy this title and you know theyre going to release the extended edition later this year when will these studios learn that consumers are tired of movie studios are kicking consumers in the gut the lord of the rings movies represent some of the best movies out there but this review is for new line cinema and their decision to release the theatrical version of the movies on blu ray instead of releasing the extended edition 
i am in the same camp as most i absolutely adore the series and the effort by peter jackson but in this economy vote with your wallet demand the extended edition and for gods sake clean up the picture they can do it but greed is apparent here i read the reviews on multiple blu ray review sites while the sound is stellar with dts hd ma and the picture quality and sharpness is all over the place this is not year old movie 
films stars this release starsthe extended editions are the original films the way the films were originally made they had to edit them down for the theatrical release so that they wouldnt be too long return of the king is almost hours extended and you cant show a movie in the theater that is that long the movies were great in the theater no doubt about it but the extended editions are the reason why this is one of the best trilogys of all time it is not like many of these other so called extended movies where they just add some crappy deleted scenes that were removed because they made no sense the lord of the rings extended versions were how the film was intended to be shown and is how they should be released i dont care if they release both versions seperate although i prefer it if they released both versions in one set because it is bluray afterall i just want to have the option to choose what they are doing is taking advantage of the fans thinking they will settle for this only to rebuy it again in the future well the studio is wrong we are not the same breed as the george lucas kiss ass club who buy star wars a million times because he wont give in and release something that is not worth upgrading i like many others patiently waited the extra year after each film was released to buy the extended editions on dvd i did not just give in and settle for the theatrical editions after all these years of owning the extended editions i think it is time for an hd upgrade it also helped that i saw each film multiple times in the theater to wait that long but the point is that we are fans that can wait not impulse fans like george lucas has created either way do not buy this i am pretty sure peter jackson is not behind this move he is so proud of his extended editions that if it were up to him the films would probably only be released as extended editions 
the lotr trilogy was a big risk so many people know and love these books vast in scope and how could it possibly live up to our collective expectations somehow they met and exceeded them true the theatrical version were quite long for watching in the theatre so i understand cutting some of the extended scenes even though the extended versions add so much watching the movie at home is different you can take a break if you need to i loved the movies and so like many i bought the theatrical and extended versions of the dvds but i will only buy the extended blu ray and encourage everyone who loves these movies to do the same send a message to the studios that you want them to add value to earn your business with the highest quality of both the theatrical and extended versions as well as a digital version you can take with you let them know we the consumer have choices now some unfortunately net them no profit at all vote with your dollars 
no extended edition what are they thinking oh yeah money thats all they care about 
first the credit card companies then the health insurance industries and now this so okay its not quite the same thing but still everyone is always trying to rip you off even the friendly shiny movie people 
i prefer the extended versions but even if i didnt i wouldnt understand why they cant release both simultaneously i mean just how stupid do they think we are then again i did fall for this swindle with the dvd releases but never again when you treat honest customers who actually want to pay you money for one of your products so shabbily and you keep a product hostage until an inferior version has sold enough you build a culture of animosity and disrespect between your industry and the populace at large this happened with the recording industry and look where that got them 
not only are they trying to get you to pay times but the quality of the blu ray release was done half like a typical no name catalog release video quality was given a out of on review of the blu ray edition warner needs to get their heads out of their and do quality releases instead of crap like this one this is one release they should of done a good job on will they do a better quality release on the extended cuts i doubt it this is freaking warner brothers were talking about they could care less about quality the price of this should be cut in half to properly represent the effort warner put into the release 
this has got to be the longest pre order i have ever seen this has been available for pre order for most of any guesses on when it might actually have an availability date im guessing around thanksgiving 
i already have dvds sets of this im not buying blu ray sets im actually waiting for the extended blu ray version with synthetic dthat will probably be out in years 
seriously im glad there is an uprising five stars or more for the films no stars for this money grabbing b s 
paramount is doing the same thing with the star trek movies on bd hoping youll buy the theatrical release then buy it again when the directors cut is out well not this time once burned shame on you twice burned shame on me just wait for the version you want 
i will hold out for the extended version or wait for the price to drop below 
double dipping is impersonal insensitive business practice at its worst these companies made mega buck of us during the films theatre and latter dvd both theatrical and extended releases show some damned respect for your consumer you pricks boycotting this till the extended release comes 
dont buy this version wait for the extended ones i would rather have the extended versions on standard dvd than the short versions on blu ray 
why the extended version of this amazing film is not on blu ray is a disgrace just keep bleeding money from us one version at a time i havent watched this and i wont once you have seen the extended version there is no way you can watch the theatrical version
this is a serious case of greedy double dipping give the consumers what they want in this day and age of internet piracy this move by new line is baffling they are almost encouraging pirate downloads of the films by offering an incomplete package on blu ray discontinue this item and give us the real versions with the real extra materials this is pathetic 
i actually appreciate both the extended and theatrical editions i didnt mind terribly having to buy both versions until they were released together for less than i paid seperately talk about screwing over true fans for a little extra money they must think we either or stupid or have no self control to fall for the same ploy twice i cannot believe how arrogant they are 
yes were all fed up of the mercenary profiteering and contempt we the consumers are held in by the studios weve all had it stuck to us by the nonsensical and restrictive practice of the dvd regions regime and as for this continuing sickening format whoring what comes next d bluray im no luddite but enough already 
yet another way for the greedy b ds that made this film to rip off the fans instead of releasing the extended editions which you know they will do later maybe just before the hobbit comes out theyre doing what they did with the standard def dvd releasing the theatrical version in the hopes that well buy these and the blu rays too disgusting they can keep them 
i dont mind spending more on a complete version but i totally agree why should the public get the corporate shaft with multiple versions in blu ray not they made enough money off me on the numerous dvd versions just say no to this blu ray multiple version trickery we wont get fooled again 
one bluray to rule them all one bluray to find them one bluray to bring them all and in the darkness bind them to greed sauron created this bluray in order to create greed among men this bluray release not the actual film which is awesome should be thrown into mt doom in fact if someone could actually get a copy of this and throw it into flaming hot magma id pay to see it i love the films however the intention of the studio is to create two versions of the film this one and the extended version and release the crappy theatrical version first on bluray forcing hd buffs to buy the movie twice dont buy this please 
i hate to give anything related to lotr star but this is ridiculous by now most fans who would shell out money for the blue ray version of these films has seen the extended edition and would agree that theyre much better than the theatrical versions so its obvious that this is nothing more than a way to milk more money out of the lotr market and fanbase i will wait for the extended versions because i have both versions already and wont be utterly dying to pay for something i already have unless its both versions or the extended only and it better meet the expectations of brilliance that has been peter jacksons lotr 
well here we go again another movie studio company trying to profit as much as they possibly can from a franchise that made serious dollars at the box office and home video sales why would i want to purchase the theatrical versions on blu ray when the extended versions are guaranteed to be released i guess i along with the thousands of other lotr fans who posted comments have to wait until that happens 
the one star is for new line not the movie they could very easily have put both cuts on one set with the extras instead they want to milk the cow for all its worth they think the fans will buy it then double dip for the extended cut well i have bad news for new line lots of folks will boycot 
when the original lotr trilogy came out on dvd i ran to get them then they released the extended version on two discs then they reissued the enxtended version on one disc now they tempt me with the bluray of the original theatrical version forget it and avatar ill wait and wait and wait by the time they decide to issue a full extended goody filled edition they will probably be bringing out d versions of the original theatrical version people need to read what is being offered caveat emptor still holds true 
i have no intnetion in buying this until the extended versions come out better yet as others have stated put both into the box set even if you have to charge a bit more do it right the first time 
there is no reason why new line should not release the extended editions as well and give people a choice they are banking on making oodles of cash by offering both at different times the best way to handle this as consumers is to boycott this version and wait for the extended versions 
this is just a ripoff why not put the extended version out right away i love the movies i even like the theatrical version better though i admit the extended one has its advantages but why not give me the choice it worked with the dvds for those who didnt know that an extended version was comming but we wont let it happen again 
as most of the other readers have stated we wont get fooled again my post is a vote against the double dipping or duping by the studio in order to sell a movie twice it looks like avatar is doing the same thing this is really insulting to the intelligence of the audience that made this movie a success i wont buy the theatrical version which probably all of us already have sitting next to the extended version i predict the blu ray extended version will be offered for christmas explotation this fall 
like the hundreds of others here i am so tired of double dipping yes studios know that fans are eager to buy films they love but why not treat the consumer with some respect and make one complete issue i dont see this changing in the foreseeable future because there are those who will continue to support inferior versions until the real one arrives what a message we could all send if no one bought this not one copy sold im sure the studios would take notice so thats my challenge leave this on the shelves and wait until the extended versions are released on blu ray 
i ad my voice to the chorus i will not buy this until the extended version comes to blueray i didnt fall for it the first time and i will not fall for it this time 
i agree with the statements from other reviews where it says that the studio needs to release the theatrical and the extended versions on blue ray now 
my review is the same as everyone else on this page what are they thinking except to rip off fans of this series by trying to force them to buy the theatrical editions and then wait another year to re buy the extended ones vote with your wallet or pocketbook and dont support this kind of nonsense update on newline just announced a date in april for the release of the theatrical editions on blu ray they have not heard the requests of fans and seem unlikely to generate much interest or money from these releases 
get ready for the first rip off then the extened then the extended gift pack then the th annverisary then 
how many times do they expect us to pay for this this should come free with an extended version 
i cant believe they went against the wishes of the fan base and ignored the countless pleas for the extended edition yet again corporate choice control tactics in a pitiful and moronic attempt to get more money from consumers do they think we are all ignorant just because we are not powerful and rich like them 
i am with everyone else i waited so long for blue ray of my favorite movies ever and feel screwed over as well i already bought the originals then the extended when it came out there was no reason to not release this with the extended versions other than greed fail 
great movie short sighted business practices i am content to view my existing dvd theatrical extended versions until new line cinema decides to produce distribute the extended versions on blu ray id prefer this packaged with the theatrical version but my purchasing will wait for extended version at minimum as a side note i wont be conned into buying multiple blu ray versions from other franchises famous for multiple versions either hopefully the star wars star trek studios take note c burns the dude my hat is off to you 
thanks for nothing anyone who buys this is a sucker cash grab by the studios plain and simple a full extended all bluray disc collection of these films is what the fans want this is garbage 
the movie studio is doing it again by releasing the theatrical editions now thinking that avid fans will flock to purchase this product and then capitalize on that impulsivity by releasing the extended editions a year later it seems that new line is taking advice from lucasfilm these days 
how much video can you fit on a blu ray disc on a gb disc over hours of high definition hd video can be stored in standard definition sd video a gb disc will hold up to hours so lets do the math the theatrical version of fellowship for example is minutes while the extended version runs minutes clearly a dual layer blu ray disc has more than enough capacity to hold both versions of the film although i normally take the attitude that if you dont want something you dont have to buy it this release is a blatant attempt to exploit the trilogys fanbase with the assumption that were such fanatics that well buy anything related to lotr so in this case i say screw em 
b s to these release the extended editions you jerks this product is absurd they want to rip you off yet again wait for the extended editions 
i want the extended versions and they should cut together even more commentaries from what they already have recorded there must be hours of that stuff sitting in a drawer 
dont buy this version watch your dvds for now and wait until they release the extended versions dont let them get you twice 
yep i fell for these tricks a few times before back when dvd sales were becoming a large part of the marketing plan for movie studios a common trick would be to release a more complete version of a movie after sales of the vanilla dvd started to drop off this would encourage fans to spend their money yet again on a more comprehwensive package lotr did this as well on their initial dvd releases now that this fantastic film is ready to hit blu ray new line cinema is releasing the theatrical version only to start things off well most lotr fans know that the extended version is the far superior version and will undoubtedly be released on blu ray its too bad that the studio could not release both versions in the same package which is why this gets only one star 
releasing the theatrical versions on bluray instead of the extended editions is a waste of both new line cinemas and our time as consumers nobody is foolish enough to buy these when we know damned well the extended editions are right around the corner 
sorry new line you wont be getting any of my money until the extended versions are released 
s o s over again rip off the public bilk them out of their last red cent let me suggest to the studio marketing geniuses that they can digest these disks packaging accompanied with a cheap bottle white wine 
ive never reviewed a movie before its release so this is a first for me im not even reviewing the movie just the version im retired and watching and buying favorite movies is an enjoyable pastime but having bought for example the first few harry potter movies on dvd and then re purchasing them on blu ray pushed me near my limit of tolerance and of spending ill probably watch the br version of lotr but guess what wb ill get them from netflix not provide you with another profit you would have made from a sale if im still around when the extended set comes out i might buy it then or i might not im seriously wondering if i should by any more dvds or brs at all i seldom get the urge to watch a movie i own right now given that its a far better value proposition to simply rent them hmmm now that ive put my thoughts down in writing i think ill cancel the outstanding brs i have on order from amazon i already have dvds of the wizard of oz and snow white i dont suspect ill watch them or my other br order of the new star trek movie more than once or twice certainly not more than once a year thanks wb thinking this over ive changed my mind on buying new disks i have too many already and theres no sense in getting more my life feels greatly simplified thanks for the multiple versions they guided me toward a decision i should have made years ago 
i cannot believe that the studio is really going to release only the theatrical release when a blu ray edition finally shows up i already had to wait an extra year for each of the extended editions and now i am going to have to wait again to get lotr on blu ray note to the heartless beancounter who thought they could pull the theatrical release extended edition stunt a second time just because no one is buying this release does not mean that no one will buy the extended editions it just means that we know that you could fit it but you just wanted to try and milk us for more money we arent buying it 
new line threw away the opportunity of a lifetime if theyd have chosen art over profit as jackson originally did with the films themselves they could have created the most stunning exquisite overwhelm the fans package here and put both versions and all the extras from all the versions including the complete video diaries currently broken up among the three released versions of these films into one lovely or disc set with enhanced booklets and all the trimmings even in these tough times i and many many thousands of others would happily have shelled out our hard earned cash for such a treat instead we get marketing their theatrical experience with the films themselves should have taught them to not let the bean counters make the decisions here i wouldnt touch this soulless cash grab of a product for all the lamas bread in rivendell i will of course grit my teeth and buy the extended versions in blu ray however disappointing the packaging but im on record here as being disgusted with the cash cow crowd 
theatrical edition on blu ray what happen to the extended edition or at the very least offer both i guess if you have money to waste you will buy this version i so wanted to see lotr trilogy on my p inch tv i wont watch this version out of spite i cant believe peter jackson would do this to us or was it a studio decision in any case i will pass as most die hard fans i agree with another fan that is why people buy bootleg copies of movies bring us the extended version on blu ray with a discount for owners of the original dvd that is the reason i purchased gladiator and braveheart on blu ray i got back for the upgrade 
i purchased both the standard theatrical edition dvds and extended editions and only mildly regretted the double dipping because i really love these films but as the saying goes been there done that im overjoyed by the prospect of investing in the extended versions on blu ray because the longer versions are a superb advancement on an already outstanding series of epic films and the higher p resolution can only make these great films look better but i draw the line at double dipping again while some may argue that both the theatrical and extended versions are valid and should be considered on their own merits id argue that both could technically be described as theatrical cuts since i distinctly recall the extended versions being shown briefly in theaters near the time of the extended dvd releases to make this easier to understand try thinking of the extended cuts as the road show engagement versions typically road show engagements are any publicly shown feature that is longer that a films standard nation wide release as a consumer you might opt for the standard theatrical release but more often than not youre going to prefer the longer road show engagement edit why edit a film down to a shorter length if the extended length tells the story better yes editing the length probably allows the theater owner to get an extra showing in and avoids the dreaded intermission but this isnt a valid concern for ht enthusiasts especially when it doesnt allow a story its best pacing this distinction may or may not make the reduced length theatrical release version less valid in consumers eyes but it does weigh heavily on my wallet now if you were going to select a version to have in your movie collection which would you choose the longer road show version or the shortened national release if the reduced length actually improved the pacing of these films without equivocation id prefer the latter but alas subjectively speaking tolkiens trilogy benefits from the extended length of each film by emphasizing the difficulty of the heroes epic journey as envisioned the longer pacing of each extended cut is an improvement over the standard theatrical release finally in this economy can consumers reasonably be expected to double dip again when bds higher resolution format is still struggling to gain wide acceptance due to its much higher price point over standard dvd higher resolution is attractive but it becomes a moot point given the economic reality im sure that peter jackson is readying some tasty extras for the extended versions but someone should point out to him that expanding blu rays and lotrs fan customer base by providing more bang for the buck should be the first priority the bottom line why should customers be asked to wait years for a premium package containing all three extended versions when each extended cut could be offered separately over approximately the same period in a bare bones form the three film package with all the extras could then be reissued to coincide with the hobbit premier note this is still double dipping but at least it wouldnt be shorting the whole lotr audience food for thought rcc
i agree with every outraged review here there is simply no excuse for this i hope that no one is stupid enough to buy this the cynicism behind this is beyond outrageous this is such a blatant attempt to milk consumers out of every dollar that they can i have no objection to studios trying to make a profit but putting us in untenable situations is completely unacceptable ive been yearning for a blu ray of lotr since i first got my ps but no one in their right mind would want the theater versions in fact if they were to put out both the theater and extended versions out on the same day i would bet that the extended versions would out sell the theater versions to obviously the studio is hoping that there are enough idiots who will be duped into buying this edition my wish is that this edition bombs i hope no one buys it that they throw it out there and no one picks it up so i continue to yearn for the time when i can get lotr on blu ray it simply wont be this edition 
i concur with the hundreds of other reviewers in giving this effort star of course the item really deserves no stars and when and if they put out the extended versions in blu ray ill be there until then i wont spend a cent 
the one star is not to denigrate the movies contained in this set but rather to protest the decision on the studios part to hold off on the release of the extended versions 
what more can be said about peter jacksons monumental and inspired trilogy of j r r tolkeins beloved masterpiece of courage in the face of overwhelming evil what makes tolkeins epic so enduring and powerful is that it is about resisting the temptation to use occult powers for personal gain not as in harry potter how to exploit them the lowly hobbits fight is not unlike the plight of english resisting the wave of nazi evil sauron washing over the land the shire by the way principal antagonist sauron literally means abhorred tolkeins story resonates on a moral historical and spiritual level jacksons version is as fully realized as tolkeins prose suggests maybe more so the blu ray version includes the theatrical cut of the fellowship of the rings the two towers and the return of the king a special features disc contains more than seven hours of fascinating material that covers all aspects of this remarkable production also included are three digital download discs if you dont already own this film this is a nice package surprisingly or maybe not theres no option to watch jacksons extended cut of the trilogy which to be frank puts a bitter taste in my mouth it should be included in this new hi def package a backlash from fans of lotr is sure to follow says one we hate being used and treated like fools by a greedy studio new line cinema how many times does one need to buy this film shame 
the movie is a all time great and the extended version was much better watched a friends copy of the new blue ray release and had forgotten just how much better the extended version was as to quality blue ray made it some what better but to be honest after watching my extended dvd version i felt that with my system the picture was not so much better that i should once again be swindled into buying this movie severl times as with the original dvd had they released it in both versions in this set i would have bought it but i am not going to be sucked in with a inferior version and then again for the superior version my dvd version is so good i may not buy it when they come to their senses and release it in bd wont get fooled again they should wise up the consumer is getting smarter and this tactic of releasing it over and over is a low blow to the inteligence of those of us that love this movie they could not even put the whole set in bd shame shame hope you lose your butt on this scam oh yea and seeing it at the store it does not make it clear that this is theatrical version double rip off and tacky scam at least amazon started listing it as theatrical version love seeing numbers fall from like a stone 
some confusion among other reviewers that somehow were obligated to post a five star recommendation for the movie this is an incorrect understanding of the review process if i were reviewing the movie itself it would get a five this review is for the product as listed in other words i do not recommend buying this product dvd this product is being created for no other reason than to dupe people into buying this movie twice again those of us who were huge fans bought the original dvds of the theatrical releases then the studio finally released the extended editions even though they could have released both at the same time now that blu ray has won the high def battle the studios are salivating at screwing us all again the same way please do not let them get away with holding the extended edition hostage until everyone buys the theatrical versions if you agree with my review you can do your part to exert influence on the studio by doing the following create your own star review thus increasing the number of star reviews please hit helpful on this review so that the producers give up this total rip off and release the extended editions now along with the theatrical versions if we dont theyll wait years to release the extended editions until they think theyve bled out the last drop of money they can get out of us click not helpful to the studio pr spokesholes whove populated this page with five star positive reviews claiming to be reviewing the movie this product not the movie blows dont buy it 
preying on ignorance is not a good business model if you want this movie in hi def do yourself a favor and wait for the extended versionsyou will have to wait longer but will save money and hopefully help the studios realize they cant get away with this shysty business practice the studios will say were releasing it for those who dont want the extended versions what they wont say is we wont bother warning people better editions of the movie are on the way so if you buy it shrugcaveat emptor
lotrs are my all time favorite films unfortunately i cant keep coming up with more money to buy each release that comes out thankfully i was warned of an extended version about the time of the release of the st movie on dvd i did buy the first theatrical copy of the first movie just to get me by before i purchased the whole extended edition in dvd i have my blu ray player and i know theyll have the extended editions later so ill wait and just keep enjoying my regular dvd copies im looking forward to the hobbit last time i heard it will be shot in three parts thats a lot of story to cover lord of the rings rulz but this theatrical release is just about greed 
best movie s of all time fanatical fans yet the studio thinks they can get us to buy separate versions again no way jack this is a rip off please wait for the extended editions please do not let them get away with holding the extended edition hostage until everyone buys the theatrical versions if you agree with my review you can do your part to exert influence on the studio by doing the following create your own star review thus increasing the number of star reviews please hit helpful on this review so that the producers give up this total rip off and release the extended editions now along with the theatrical versions if we dont theyll wait years to release the extended editions until they think theyve bled out the last drop of money they can get out of us click not helpful to the studio pr spokesholes whove populated this page with five star positive reviews claiming to be reviewing the movie this product not the movie blows dont buy it 
in comparison to dvd blu ray has x the amount of space capacity new line youve already double dipped triple dipped actually they released a version of all three movies with both the theatrical and extended on it i just dont think its right to triple dip again i know thats whats going to happen theyre just going to do it all over again on blu ray new line is going to release the theatrical the extended and then a set with both the theatrical and the extended on it my question is why not just skip the bullcrap and release the lord of the rings ultimate editions that would be fantastic think about it we would have all three of the lord of the rings films all three of the lord of the rings extended editions and all of the fantastic estimated hours of documentary footage material all on blu ray in one set thats my point there is obviously enough space on nine theoretically how many discs this theatrical blu ray set has blu ray discs to hold all the material that should be in this set 
yes i am a huge lotr fan but i will not be suckered into buying versions again as with the original dvds i jumped on every theatrical dvd release and then repurchased the extended editions i felt cheated and the theatrical release dvds became absolutely worthless i just gave them to friends well no more i will wait for years if need be but i will not spend a penny on this version of lotr on bluray my dvd ext eds will serve me just fine until the bluray version is released even if its 
i heard on tv that technicians under the direction of peter jackson spent hours cleaning this up and improving the color for hd hours that sure doesnt seem like much time to me certainly not enough to make it special if they watched the original footage the first time then watched the final cleaned up version that would take hours out of that whether you buy this theatrical release or wait for the blue ray extended editions depends on which version you most prefer watching im partial to the extended editions so like many i will wait at the release price both the theatrical and extended editions should have been included if they were i would have bought the package 
i bought these on the recommendation page i was rapidly clicking and missed the fact that these are not the extended editions i asked to exchange and was surprised that they did not release the extended editions onto blu ray i cannot believe that the movie studios are going to milk the money out of blu ray like they do with dvds blu ray already costs more then a regular dvd and to double dip is just despicable 
i cant figure out who this is marketed to it seems like new line is trying to come up with every combination of lord of the rings footage they can get onto different dvd editions let me explain exactly what you get here discs for each of the movies discs total disc contains the theatrical edition of the film on one side and the extended edition on the other the second disc contains a brand new two hour featurette by filmmaker costa botes the featurettes are basically a guy walking around with a camera while people get ready on the set and filming people they are not comprised of minute making of helms deep set specials or anything like that apparently new line has to release the films with the documentaries due to contractual obligations however i still cant see anyone but the most hard core of fans buying these the documentaries are actually quite good and its too bad they werent on one of the other versions that has been released but unless you are solely buying these discs for the documentaries and even then theyre not so good as to charge this much you dont not want this set the discs do not contain dolby dts surround sound and they contain literally nothing aside from the films no commentaries or anything as i said the documentaries are pretty interesting if youre a huge fan and can afford that much money to watch sean astin make jokes about his makeup or scenes of bloopers and stuntmen falling off their horses but if you are looking at purchasing this for any other reason or to own a copy of the movies i strongly suggest you get one of the other trilogy sets instead 
i love this trilogy and think its possibly one of the best films ever made however i will not be exploited and teased with the almost complete deal no way am i going to purchase this till they come out with the extended releases as they should have done in the first place thats why we got blu ray 
there is absolutely no way that i would purchase the lord of the rings trilogy on blu ray unless it included both the theatrical and extended cuts of each film in addition all supplemental materials from both the theatrical and extended standard dvd sets should be included on one definitive blu ray set given the massive amounts of data that can be stored on a single blu ray disc i implore anyone who is a fan of this trilogy to take a stand with me and others against greedy movie studios like warner bros who routinely try to make loyal fans by multiple copies of their favorite films is it not enough that we moviegoers and dvd buyers have lined the pockets of these greedy jerks with billions of our hard earned dollars the only way to stop this slimy double dipping practice is to open our mouths and close our wallets 
theres an old saying in tennessee i know its in texas probably in tennessee that says fool me once shame on shame on you fool me you cant get fooled again 
who is running nulines marketing a monkey once the extended version was released the theatrical version became a nonstarter i will not buy until the extended is released 
honestly why are they even bothering with the theatrical editions anyone that cares enough about these movies to spend this kind of money for them on br will want the extended editions which are the only versions that exist as far as im concerned 
is is really too much to ask after all of the billions of dollars in revenue from one of the most important anticipated and masterly performed franchises in this history of film get a little bit more attention and dedication to fans instead of simply expecting us the true fellowship to shell out over another more times its too much i remained loyal even when i painstakingly waited for each dvd release to come out then stayed with them when they came out with the collectors edition and then again when they came out even later with the special edition with yet another more minutes of unseen footage and hours of commentary lol but no more i mean its almost as if someone at the studio actually did keep the ring to themselves and have turned all sauron on us all if we give in to them this time then theyll continue to leech us for already seen content speaking for myself i just want to see it all again in all its bluray splendor but all in one doable collection its great to see so much support for the cause cheers 
how many versions of lotr do i need how many vesions of star wars do i have too many i am doing fine with both versions of the dvd until extended blu ray comes out 
time warner which owns newline has already got my money three times for these films movie tickets the theatrical versions on dvd the lush multi dvd and admittedly beautifully packaged extended editions when as has been pointed they could have released both at the same time but no more i know the economics of hollywoods two dimension movie factory the successful films must pay for the overwhelming number which fail those who deride fluff like transformers and gi joe should remember that these films fund brilliant movies such as last years the hurt locker but this goes beyond economics and is just plain avarice despite the fact that these movies have grossed some billion dollars worldwide not counting dvd sales and merchandizing which im sure triples the box office total at least time warners greed knows no bounds even though each for a disc blu ray set is a good bargain only the dimmest can fail to see the naked money grab going on here as has been pointed out there is no reason the extended theatrical and perhaps a combined set of both versions could not be released at the same time on blu ray their naked greed is breathtaking though not at all surprising they got my money twice on dvd they will not get it twice on blu ray if i have to wait until hell freezes over or to get the extended versions on blu ray then so be it in the meantime shame on you time warner the only good thing i can see coming out of this and or buying this if moneys no object for you is that the cast and crew will receive residuals for sales of this set as sean astin reveals in his autobiography he was initially paid only for all three films tho the core cast members did receive figure bonuses after return of the king but you can can be sure that the other cast crew members didnt receive anything beyond their first skin flint salaries however time warner youve milked fans of quite enough i think even jack warners boundless appetite would have quailed at a four attempts to screw fans not to mention making us wait so long for hd versions after all blu ray if not hd dvd versions could have been released several years ago i agree with the reviewer who suggests writing your own star review if we can or such reviews up on amazon perhaps time warner may pay attention tho im not holding my breath until the extended versions appear my wallet is closed 
ok i was about to pre order this and then i realized that it had one star reviews and the first one star review title i read told me why basically when the movies were released on dvd it came in two flavors theatrical and extended first the theatrical came out what you saw in theaters then the much better adding hours onto the story extended version came out when the movies were shot jackson and the world knew that there would be no way to really make a movie on these books and stay in the hour movie time frame so the movies were shot and then cut down the extra that they cut out added a little over an hour per movie i think not checking wikipedia while i write this even with the extra hours added onto this trilogy they are in no way close to the books in content but still really good basically i think the extended blu ray will only be like bucks more when it comes out so i would just wait i have no idea why they do this well i know why there is a sucker born every minute 
i have been reading all the reviews for the lord of the rings blu ray trilogy and had to make my feelings known i am behind all those posting star reviews and think many who are fussing at those of us posting star reviews dont truly comprehend why we are doing so when the original three films being the fellowship of the ring the two towers and the return of the king were originally released on dvd i was unaware of the extended cuts that peter jackson was feverishly working on then after tt was released on dvd in its disc theatrical cut i heard about fotr extended cut that was soon to be available and i was aware of why they were not being released with the theatrical cuts first all three films werent even out of theaters and secondly peter was still working on them but they came rather quickly after each films initial theatrical cut release the problem with what new line is doing with this set is simple both versions are available now and people many people have chosen which they prefer many like the theatrical cuts and thats fine many like myself prefer the extended cuts and thats fine also but new lines inability to allow us the option to choose right out of the gate on this blu ray release or have both available in one set is simply inexcusable they took away our right to choose many have fussed saying the extended are coming just wait and get over it why when those that prefer the theatrical cuts will be sitting at home watching theirs in crystal clear hi def we who prefer the extended wont and that is unacceptable that option should be there from the get go for us as the consumer to make not them us new line was about to go under when they took a huge chance on pj and the lord of the rings but we the consumer made them blockbusters by word of mouth and repeat viewings and standing in line for hours or overnight to get tickets and to buy the merchandise and weve waited patiently for the films to hit blu ray and now only a percentage of the people who want them on blu get what they have waited a long while for no aint happening so ive told all my friends to stay away from this set and they plan to new line will get nothing from me on this release this is a trip into mordor i refuse to take sorry ill stay in the shire with my simple dvds til they get it right 
i think its incredibly rude to even bother marketing the theatrical releases as they are very incomplete and dont offer the viewer the actual experience in its entirety this is a horrible practice and if no one buys the initial release it will send a clear message 
i will wait for the extended cut to come out for blu ray u stink new line 
i guess people is tired of bs blue ray is got capability it can hold both versions theatrical and extended do it both versions together now other wise keep this versions for yourselves ill wait with the rest til you published the darn thing right 
ok dont buy this version its a rip off pure and simple blu ray can easily have both theatrical and extended on the same disc if needed but they are going to pull a lucasfilm step on suckers and get them to buy the theatrical and extended versions of blu ray by offering the better version extended at a later time dont fall for it scam scam 
i echo the thousands of reviewers who have given this one star the movie s will always remain in the canon of great cinema so please understand this is not a dis to the movie only the studios decision to try and make us buy it twice again first they released the theatrical versions which we bought then they released the extended editions which we bought now they are issuing the theatrical versions in blu ray who thinks they wont release the extended versions in blu ray a few months later dont buy this twice wait shame on new line i got fooled once i wont get fooled again 
dear new line are you looking at your sales tanking are you surprised that your viewing public is so savvy does greed taste best before or after the lack of sales as obie wan once said you dont wont to do this go home and re think your life 
fully agree with most comments shame on new line for not releasing a bd with both versions via seemless branching easily done on bd and it better not have edge enhancement and dnr give us the highest quality video and audio until ill hold onto my cash 
i voice my outrage with the rest of the community i didnt buy avatar for the same reason i wont buy this im not going to spend twice the money for the same movie i can wait my dvd editions are just fine for now 
i got burned with the king kong dvd releases two disc version then three disc version then four disc version shame on studios for nickel and diming people like this i saw the blue ray of lotr at the local best buy and i did not even touch the box first thing that popped into my head was that they are going to release multiple versions again with extras hold off buying this version i promise that there will be more exhaustive versions for more money i personally cant wait till digital downloads become the dominant format and i believe never too soon with blue ray being relegated to bargain bins with the title stop gap technology 
this was the same studio that fought peter jackson for years trying to deny him his fair share of the profits they agreed upon in writing now they want to screw the fans over after we already bough these on expensive dvd box sets and make us double dip again enough is enough 
ill be joining the massive group of one starers to protest this release sadly we are actually in the minority of buyers in the entire us of a a huge amount of people dont give a bean to either or here most just remember the theatrical release and blu ray being a new media format wouldnt mind buying this version to relive what they experienced when walking into the bijou 
we all know the game by now first release a basic version then oh i dont know by the holidays release the loaded version this is really really sad and greedy on their part do not buy this the extended versions are awesome 
once again we are being treated as idiots why would anyone buy the very good theatrical release versions on blu ray when they could wait and buy the much better so very much better extended editions i know why they are being released this way for exactly the same reasons that have already been posted they truly believe that the vast majority of lotr fans are so hungry to get their hands on these movies in blu ray that we will fork over our hard earned dollars to buy the theatrical versions now and then also buy the extended versions when they release them at some later date dont be foolish dont play into their money grubbing hands if enough people refuse to buy these theatrical version it will surely expedite the release of the extended versions because they will want to put something out that people will actually buy i have a big screen plasma and the standard dvds of the extended editions look great they truly do so just enjoy yours until they eventually release the extended version on blu ray which will no doubt look absolutely incredible but me and my money can and will happily wait for that day to come before i fork over another penny i refuse to be played for a fool 
theres a huge elephant in the room new line and pretending its not there isnt gonna make it go away the studio execs at new line think they can pull the same trick on the fans they pulled back in the days of dvd no double dipping new line shame on you 
do yourself a favor and read the first amazon review for this blu ray vote helpful on it and write your own star review to get the message across we arent going to take it anymore double dipping is for suckers our extended editions of the lotr trilogy on plain old dvd will do just fine untilthe studios wise up and learn to release both versions at the same time on blu ray 
ive been on the war path when it comes to these damn studios and their shameless manipulation first they pass off cast away and t as blu ray movies when they are really not then they pull this nonsense with lotr and when it comes time for fox to put the star wars series out they will repeat the same bs and the same suckers will line up to buy star wars 
fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me in the words of the who we wont be fooled again its only a matter of time before the branching version with both cuts of the films is available on blu ray of course new line will release the extended cuts first so its the third version on blu ray that well all wait for this time in the meantime i have my dvd extended versions to watch 
a lack of the extended version makes me sad why would anyone pay for the theatrical versions in this day and age also dey took er jerbs 
read the fine print folks this item contains the theatrical cuts of each film plus with a total of only discs there isnt much room for extras think about it the deluxe editions of the first two films already have more discs than this entire box set its well known that peter jackson is hard at work putting together a mammoth deluxe box set of the lotr trilogy that will include not only new special features but also the theatrical and the extended versions of all three films in particular the extended version of rotk is rumored to dramatically improve the narrative flow of that already excellent conclusion to what is perhaps the greatest movie trilogy of all time its hard to see who would be interested enough in lotr to buy this set but not interested enough to wait for the definitive edition of the films on dvd 
at the very least release the extended versions at the same time dont insult our intelligence
we have tough times we have a great deal of bad issues to deal with hollywood and the home video market whine to the media about how their incomes have dropped during the recession the answer to their woes is a simple one stop putting out blu rays and dvds that only a small ratio of people are foolish enough to buy this package for the lord of the rings is a shining example of just this problem there is no doubt in this reviewers mind that the trilogy will once again be offered later as their extended editions the latter of the versions is what the fans want and it comes as no surprise that new line has offered up the theatrical cuts first people who want bragging rights on their block will clamor for it that is about it also people who just never bothered to read up on this release will buy it then be stuck with versions they didnt want its sad the home video companies should take a good long look at what they are releasing to us before they begin to cry again about their stock sitting and gathering dust this will be an exercise in gross greed i will be one of the many that play their dvd extended versions in their bluray players and rejoice until the proper versions are offered to us 
what a rip off what ignorant sheep are we taken for if the truth is told by the other reviews of this product then let my voice be heard as well i will not buy a product produced to be a waste of money when it damn well could have been produced and sold for a lot less money i would have loved to have bought this lotr trilogy had it been made budget savvy but it stinks too much of greed to even touch 
were not getting taken again we absolutely love the extended version of lotr and that will be the only version we will buy to watch on our blu ray the wait is worth it 
do not believe people who says they dont care for the extended edition obviously they lie this is not some bs fantasy movie like in the name of the king this is lord of the rings it will worth every single cell that we can get do not buy and support this product dont be a puppet 
when they release the extended editions on blu ray then i will buy them until then my toshiba hd a hd dvd player upconverts the standard dvd extended editions just fine as you can see from all the other reviews they are making a mistake by releasing the edited down incomplete or theatrical editions the fans for these movies are like an army and are demanding what they want how hard can it be for them to give us fans what we want they will make more money if they release the extendend editions because that is what we want to see in hi definition after seeing the greatness of the extended editions nothing else will do i am standing my ground and not buying the edited down for the theater versions we as buyers demand the full extended edition releases on blu ray 
i already own the theatrical versions on dvd and will not spend another nickel on lotr until the extended versions come out i spend a fortune on entertainment each year but may consider boycotting all new line products until they get with the program 
i will love the extended editions when they are released but i refuse to get fooled twice like you did with the dvd versions of this trilogy first you put out the plain jane theatrical versions and then a month or so later you will release the extended versions that is just distasteful to try to double dip in you customers pockets and may just stop me from even buying the extended versions whenever you release them screw me once shame on you screw me twice shame on me 
note that this is for the theatrical versions and not the extended versions which are the definitive versions this is just another case study where the studios are trying to get consumers to buy first the regular theatrical versions and then come out with the extended directors cut versions several months down the line the studios really consider the consumers fools and if you buy this version instead of waiting for the extended then you really will have been fooled and the studios point and laugh while they count their money 
this is a joke there is a better version of these movies that turns them from good to great wait for the extended version new line is always trying to get buy to buy junk thats what this is in this form wait for the real deal 
peter jackson mentioned he will release the extended edition trilogy on blu ray in to coincide with the release of the hobbits theatrical release the two year wait would be long enough to convince suckers into buying this non extended release and hopefully buy it again in sorry ill be content with my extended edition dvds until the extended editions get released on blu ray i feel that everyone is in the same camp as me i may even pirate these versions in protest but i will never buy this knowing wb is purposely delaying the extended editions by two years hopefully the amount of protest by the series fans will reach the studio heads at wb and peter jackson but likely it will fall on deaf ears the same greedy idiots will be splitting the hobbit into two movies because one movie just isnt enough hype so we already know that wb only cares about stretching the dollar with the series 
the trilogy is a true milestone in fantasy films however i will not give another penny to those misers whose attempt to squeeze blood from a turnip rivals that of george lucas 
wow to think how much footage is missing compared to the directors cuts is one thing but then to know down the line they are going to make fans rebuy the movies once they put out the directors cut is beyond an insult i have heard talk on random websites how many one stars this series is getting and believe me we are making waves i am not buying until i get the full films 
dont buy this wait for the extended edition the only way time warner new line cinemas decision to release a theatrical only edition makes sense is if fans buy both the theatrical and the extended edition otherwise they dont make any more money unfortunately this bone head decision doesnt cost them anything other than a little time people that dont know better will buy this theatrical edition while us true fans will have to wait but they know we will still spend our money in a few years when they release the extended edition so heres what im going to do im not going to buy my own copy of the extended edition when the extended edition comes out i will pool money with some friends and well share the movie this is the only way to penalize new line cinema they need to understand that this greedy decision will actually end up costing them money 
i am one of the guilty one i did buy both versions of the dvd i know sucker 
this version should be boycotted so that the studios will learn that we are not nearly as dumb as they would like to think and really on top of this i would challenge anyone with a good upconverting dvd player to see enough difference to make this purchase worthwhile even for the extended version at least wait for the extended version to come out in br before you pop for it heck lets hold out for making them put tom bombadil and the scouring of the shire in and make it a truly worthwhile extended version worth paying for a second or third time i can wait particularly in this economy 
never i will never buy this blu ray set just so lucas can get even more money for these abominations im sure i speak for many fans when i say that i want the original unaltered trilogy no greedo shooting han first no hayden christiensen in return of the jedi no fornicating cgi jawas in the background i will not make the same mistake i made buying the dvd releases i urge every star wars fan not to buy this version do the talking with your wallets and do not buy this set cuz the only thing george lucas understands is money and if he doesnt get any than maybe he will come to his senses and release both his versions and the real versions in one set which would be the logical release 
george lucas you have messed us over for the last time we are officially serving you notice that were on strike we will not buy any edition of the star wars blu rays until you give us the original theatrical releases of your original trilogy labeling your cgi special edition monstrosities as the original trilogy is false advertising you easily could have packaged the films together but you continue playing the multiple release game on us we consumers and fans of your original films are disgusted with this abuse and we are not going to take it any more 
looking at these new movies its obvious that it sure as heck wasnt just lucas that made the originals so great i would send these expensive coasters back if i could instead i have bought a laserdisk player and the original theatrical versions on laserdisk secondhand and will burn them to dvds to preserve forever i have a feeling a small cottage industry is going to form around digital copies of the original movies shame that they may never be released on dvd but i for one will preserve the originals for future generations 
i took the time to calculate the true average of the reviews here after reading skullchrists review below dated august it is actually very easy and takes no time you just have to show all the star reviews then star etc anyway heres the breakdown star reviews star reviews star reviews star reviews star reviews total number calculation im giving it one star because i too would like the option of having the original and the quot special editions quot in one set after this review the average would be so out of is just about right skullchrist no rating manipulations 
i came to amazon to check out the reviews for the special as in youre not stupid youre special dvd edition of star wars and lo and behold there are over in only a couple of days most of them not so flattering eegads george the peasants are revolting exclamations aside i must say that there should be laws stopping egomaniacal over the hill directors from changing their past work spielberg lucas and copolla a la apocalypse now redux have all gone down that slippery slope but none as gone so far and landed on their ass so hard as darth lucas perhaps when lucass children grow up they will realise what daddy has done and say father save them until that day we are stuck with these sorry assed cged to death mutilations of pieces of art that have thrilled more teenage boys than britney spears in a tight sweater everyone has written about the horrible changes that the swollen comprimising puffy faced tyrant has made greedo shooting first whats wrong with han shooting first greedo is a bounty hunter for petes sake hes not there to sell him life insurance the horrible cged jaba the disneyification of the whole goddamn series into an extremely long and tedious toy video game commercial and yes these criticisms are valid on a review of this product the whole point of which is to decide whether you want to buy the damn thing and i say geeks of the world revolt you have nothing to lose but your cookies after all who else would buy these things anyway the only way we can send the message to george that these changes were an afront to all the that is good and holy in this world is to boycott them your dollar is the most powerful force for change if you must have a digital version of the movies buy the original vhs tapes off of ebay and transfer them help us oh consumer with disposable income youre our only hope 
first to the reviewer below me if you think star wars is a war promoting film than you better get your senses straight star wars was not meant to depict war as realistically as saving private ryan did its a pure fantasy driven film nothing more plus with scenes like luke nearly dying in the hoth battlefield i dont think it portrays war in a bright picture either as for the dvds well whats already been said here that isnt true lucas just had to tamper with the original trilogy so that he could tie in the elements from the vastly inferior prequels um shouldnt he have done the reverse when he was making the prequels no matter what anyone says these changes are distracting and take away from the story im very disapointed with the amazon reviewer and to anyone who defends the dvd set who said the changes were minor and for fans of the originals to just get over it what frightens me most about the release is how lucas is so adament in burying the original films from existance this is more than just debating on whether greedo shot first this is lucas rewriting history butchering the content either to fulfill an ego or profit erasing sebastian shaws image at the end of rotj with hayden christenson is akin to the way russian communists erased political enemies from photographs oh him he never existed i agree with everyone else that lucas can do what he wants with the original trilogy as long as consumers can have access to the original films just as they were frustratingly lucas wont even give us that option thumbs down on this release 
updated my rating from stars to star due to the additional changes in particular the yelling vader at the end of return of the jedi i couldnt stand a lot of the changes made to the original trilogy but i think i can figure out why he doesnt heed the requests for the originals the product he created from return of the jedi on is meant to appeal to children and hard core morons whose brains probably didnt develop much past childhood and probably to make his wife happy or something stupid like that he succeeded in attracting the audience he targeted the people that fell in love with the originals are a demographic that hes determined will not make him as much money a strategy to create a massive new fan base that will keep the dough flowing well into the future will fail though the prequals lack the originality substance and quality due partially to the originals having actors that could actually act and dialogue that didnt suck than the originals and will not have the same lasting effect ive tried hard to like the changes made to the originals han solo shooting first helps make his character more fascinating as he transitions from kind of a bad guy to a good guy now i think hes a giant d bag 
the crappy jabba scene the cartoonish looking mos eisley the butchering of jabbas palace and the ewok celebration song the placement of hayden i could go on and on all of this means no purchase from me george the fans have spoken we are the reason you are filthy rich please do us a favor and give us what we want i would pay sick amounts of money for original cut in hd but will not be buying these pos cartoons 
i grew up with these absolute classic movies i have been waiting since i bought my dvd player years ago for the release of these onto dvd i am a star wars purist though the original versions may not have had the super realistic special effects they had something that the new ones are lacking entirely soul i remember when i was young cracking a tear at the end of jedi as all of the ewoks and charactors danced around i can still hear that song to my horror when jedi ended this version was a dry as toast no heart at all what a stupid thing to do to the end of a one of a kind trilogy and how stupid to put young anikan in there instead of the old anikan that we were used to and then to keep obi one as an old man it just makes no freakin sense stupid just to push his rewrite of the story and george if you happen to read this i really hope your third star wars coming out in may of this year is a hell of a lot better than the other two new ones as they just do not have it i will give you a hint try a little less special effects and a whole lot more story and charactor development the first three star wars were all great movies that tied in perfectly with the previous films the new ending of jedi tore that continuity to pieces they are only cheapening the entire star wars franchise by doing these stupid changes it seems that lucas is loosing touch with what made star wars such a great movie to begin with 
like so many of the reviewers here i was very excited to get the blu ray set of the star wars trilogy luckily i had not yet unwrapped the set but went online to read the reviews what i found out blew me away after watching a few of the new scenes on youtube i took the blu ray set back to the store and never looked back at this point i am hoping to find a way to get a glimpse of the original theatrical versions on the bonus discs from the earlier dvd release and could care less if the quality is bad what i dont understand is how someone an artist can have such a complete disregard for his or her work its one thing to keep improving something while still preserving the original but its another to try to destroy that original along with the growth nostalgia and connection that it created in exchange for something of less value and quality its like life you are constantly growing and developing and may end up being the person you always wanted to be but as flawed as your past may have been its an integral part of you that made you who you are today and you cant just disregard or pretend like it didnt exist if a famous painter got up one day and decided he didnt like the way his famous masterpiece turned out would he remove it from the museum redo it and then tell the world that thats the only version they would see from now on no because then his fans who have loved the painting for so long would not look at it the same way again and instead would resort to finding the original image in any way they could this is the case with the original trilogy overall i have come to the conclusion that lucas is really a poor tasteless director with no artistic sense or integrity when the original trilogy came out there were other decision makers involved in the making of the movies and because of their advice which i am sure included the vetoing of some of lucas decisions the trilogy was a success on the other hand once the creative control went back to lucas the quality started diminishing we saw that quality in the horror that is the so called prequel trilogy as well as the continuous changes that are always being made to the original trilogy has he ever received an oscar for his work as a director i dont think so for me the biggest problem with the current so called original trilogy version of star wars is not the audio or color tweaks not the insertion of deleted scenes or improvements to cgi but the continuous effort to shove the prequels down everyones throats all this tying in between the six movies has really gotten out of hand as much as i dislike the new changes dragon call greedo ewok etc i really cant stand the replacement of shaw by christenssen in rotj that right there is the worst case of tampering with the past though the no is bad enough i am now reading something about the de masking of darth vader where once again shaws face is digitally altered to include no eyebrows and a closer resemblance to young anakin thats all brother george lucas can go on and on about how these star wars films are his and how the franchise is his creation however viewers are the ones spending the money well not anymore and investing their time in this series and if lucas keeps on going at the pace he is now he will wind up being the only one watching them 
i was lead to believe i would be getting both the digital remasters and the original releases the only reason i blew my money on this was in the hopes i could have seen the same movies that i grew up with what a rip off 
it turns out that lucas was never as talented as anyone thought he was the only reason why the original star wars films turned out to be a fun trilogy is because he was prevented by either budget or special effects limitations of the time period otherwise the films would have turned out to be the overblown messes his latest trilogy is turning out to be the evidence the so called special editions of his original trilogy the worst offenses of these retooled films arises when lucas creates new scenes which largely consist of jar jar binks level comic relief the second worse offenses consist of unnecessary cgi characters added to pre existing scenes which are glaringly obvious and look completely out of place the least of lucas offenses consist of touch ups on old special effects which in a few cases are actual improvements but even then lucas manages to screw up especially at the end of a new hope when the original exciting scene of the death star blowing up is replaced by an extremely lame burst of light ilm has fallen too much in love with having actors perform in front of blue screens with obviously computer generated characters at least in the new scene of han solo conversing with jabba the hutt harrison ford actually got to perform on a real set but jabba himself looks extremely pathetic in comparison to the animatronics version seen in return of the jedi and furthermore is much smaller in size this scene did not make the first release of a new hope because they did not have the technology to create jabba but in retrospect this was a blessing jabba comes off as a joke when seen walking beside han and demanding his money for those who have only seen the retooled et on dvd spielbergs changes e g replacing the government agents guns with walkie talkies and cleaning up the kids dialogue are far less ridiculous or a kick in the fans teeth in comparison to the changes lucas made lucas and spielberg really need to leave their old movies alone i dread to think what would happen to thx a happy ending complete with a busby berkley muscial number and guest appearances by a computer generated elmo perhaps 
star wars will remain my favorite trilogy of all times george lucas will remain one of my most despised directors of all time there was a time when we all believed that george could do no wrong he had brought us one of the most incredible stories to ever play out on the big screen it had all the action drama suspense you could possibly want it brought out a whole generation of fanatics star wars brought a smile to a persons face just to think it think about how many times you have seen the trilogy did it ever get old did you ever stop marveling at the sheer magnitude of it did you ever stop loving it did you feel that same sense of joy and wonder watching the special edition was anything lost with the new cgi better yet did you really feel that everything was right with the world once you saw that han didnt shoot greedo first did you even care do you think george lucas cares what you think feel about his movies short answer no the man has said as much in his interviews he doesnt care what fans want he doesnt care that we made him his money he doesnt care that we like the originals more he doesnt care about anything except his precious money for those of you who fall for his vision spiel take a look at the latest two installments of the star wars universe thats his vision arent you glad he didnt have cgi available for the original trilogy write it down in less than two years the original versions of the film will come out on dvd lucas will say that its for the fans but dont believe him this is a ploy he knows that if he brings out the originals first people wont buy the special edition if he brings out the special edition first then people will jump on it for the love of the series then hell bring out the original because many of those same people will buy it again dont fall into his trap wait it will come im just glad that i have my originals on vhs still its the only reason i still have a vcr 
so little georgie has made a few more enhancements hmmmm people who grew up watching these films multiple times have screamed for george to release the originals with great picture quality for some reason he refuses george lucas comments over the years have led me to believe he sort of resents us its perfectly alright to release the films as shown in theatres only with a more vibrant picture but why the resistance simple the original trilogy was not lucas vision he stated so in a press release what made him so much money is not what he really wanted i have often stated that george lucas owes his success to the star wars films because of the many forces pulling at his sleeve he was at constant war with the studio and other executives within as to what the picture would be and how it would look because he made compromises in key places because lucas was not the last word the trilogy became the success it became as he gained more control the storyline began to decline the last film return of the jedi was a subpar story with great special effects only the storyline concerning the emperor vader and luke saved the film the ewoks basically being the primary force which destroyed the empire was simply ridiculous oh yeah the whole thing was a metaphor for vietnam lucas stated it plainly huh yes his movies showed us how a less advanced culture like the ewoks could take down the powerful empire like the viet cong took down the usa at that point i was glad he was ending it and i left hoping that was the end decades later i knew what was coming and it was terrible so buy this if you must but george lucas shant receive another penny of my money for various reasons his contempt for the fans being a big one in christ jesus the lord god triumphant over sin w 
we already know this is gonna be the same crap with probably even more improvements i will keep my bonus disc original versions from a few years back and have no plans to touch this i have given lucasfilm enough money to put an african child or two in clothing and school for life its time to stop and there is why i draw the line i can only imagine what jar jar lucas is going to do to these versions will there be more ships in the background more aliens in the background louder sound effects an appearance by jar jar stinks himself who knows who cares i dont im done dont even look at buying this release just obey the stormtrooper and move along 
i wonder what george lucas would say if michael curtiz and howard koch were still alive and decided lets redo the ending and have bogart and bergman end up together after all i think he would be appalled at the thought that is how i feel at some of the changes made in the re release of this trilogy these are films that i grew up with they are in certain ways a part of my culture i dont have a problem with all of the changes made in this set hayden christiansen replaces sebastian shaw no problem it is a natural part of continuity and does not affect the plot given the prequels the new songs whatever i didnt care for the songs from jedi to begin with enhanced effects and explosions awesome new voices for the stormtroopers and boba fett hmmm ill let that slide but there are two things that i will neve forgive lucas for and they are greedo shooting first may not seem like a big deal but it is it softens the character of han solo when han took the initiative and shot greedo under that table he established himself as a character that could conceivably go either way he could be a bad guy or a good guy he could be both the character of han solo would never let anyone shoot first he is a survivor and he survives by being a rotten scoundrel john wayne never shot a guy in the back in one of his films clint eastwood would do it in a heartbeat han solo is clint not duke jaba and solo meet in the hanger another scene that softens both han and jaba are we supposed to believe that jaba would let solo go when he owes him so much money and if so why is he so hell bent on hunting him down only a short time later what changed his mind all of the sudden the whole scene is weak and makes jaba look inept and han look like a blubbering wuss sorry george but you destroyed my movie by going just a little bit too far you can play with effects and do a few continuity shifts but do not mess with my favorite characters because you want it to be more kid friendly 
del shannon created one of rock n rolls most memorable songs of all time runaway in in del shannon re recorded runaway it was a cleaner more polished version of his original smash hit it was still a good song but something was missing it just didnt have the feel of the original less sorrow less ferocity del shannon felt his original version was too gritty and he could catch a bigger audience if he just cleaned it up he was wrong by re recording it he had changed the song purists and fans of the golden era of rock n roll wouldnt go near the re recorded version of runaway this is how i feel about the star wars original trilogy the special editions are altered versions of the originals it is not the same series of classic films fans of the original trilogy feel the same im not buying the blu ray 
hey mr lucas if you want my money youll have to give me the product i want not the product you want pretty complicated stuff huh since you messed up these movies ill be spending my money on the alien quadrilogy instead thanks for caring 
the special editions with the new digital effects were really pathetic the least george lucas could do is release both versions directors editions and the original theatrical cuts in the same boxed set spielberg did this with e t so what is georges excuse 
all the changes edits etc really gave the masterful original trilogy a major blow if it aint broke dont fix it lucas thought the original trilogy needed a fix and he was wrong too bad he is too stubborn and greedy to care he continues his greedy behavior with this release of the god offal remastered editions too bad lucas will not be known for being the creative genius he was previously recognized as before this debauchery i love the originals and to watch what he did to them is very disheartening for those who like this version are either in denial or never experienced the originals 
made obvious by other reviews here a fragile piece of childhood nostalgia has been utterly disregarded and destroyed by the creator that bestowed it frankly i lost all hope pun intended after return of the jedi so there wasnt much to live up to with this dvd release my youthful excitement and admiration wholly betrayed by the time rotjs end credits rolled back in it was clear by then that lucas had lost his center and had become an pusillanimous arrogant megalomaniac which he holds fast to this day this is the same guy that made thx and american graffiti george we hardly knew ye lets consider a few points star wars one of the worst movie titles ever by the way makes star trek sound like a william faulkner title was a landmark for its time it hasnt held up very well over the years nice s haircut there luke but should be left alone and appreciated for its time and place and for restoring the fun and mythology of old cinematic republic pictures style serial storytelling during such a lost and cynical decade georges claims that he didnt have the technology back then to make the films he wanted makes absolutely zero sense when considering his new and improved changes for the money grabbing theatrical re release and this so called official dvd version for example if he wanted to emasculate solo ruin his character arc and have greedo to shoot first and miss at close range amazingly all along he would have filmed it that way in no special effects required no cgi needed just two guys with prop guns in the middle of a soundstage why didnt he because lucas hadnt yet lost his noggin to empty adulation fame and fortune or felt compelled to pander to children as he perceived them give them more credit than that please im just glad i secured my dvd copy of american graffiti before lucas decides he was too harsh on terry the toad and edits out steves car getting stolen the empire strikes back easily the superior film of the entire series i wont even qualify the two recent stunningly bad efforts beautifully combined pathos darkness high adventure mystery mythology classic battle sequences and real character development they even barely pulled off disguising sesame streets grover as a gnarled little condescending leprechaun mongoloid jedi master wax on wax off and leia is lukes sister whoee holy make it up as you go along george but ok well go with it incestual implications aside but you better justify this later which he never did glaring story problems notwithstanding lets now remind ourselves that ol geo didnt actually direct esb it was helmed by irv kirshner i wonder how irv feels about lucas tinkering with his movie hm onto return of the jedi where it all went horribly wrong and madison avenue took over i could write ad nauseum if i havent already about the ridiculous plot character and stylistic decisions but ill only touch on a few unfortunate standouts for those with short attention spans including myself apparently geo decided to alienate the relatively sophisticated audience of empire and pander to the lunchpail and paint by numbers crowd with jedi lets see crack elite stormtroopers with sophisticated miltary weaponry and tactics being thwarted by spear wielding teddy bears nice by the way in the original version they were supposed to be wookies thanks for your input mr spielberg vader arguably the best sci fi villain ever conceived this side of ridleys alien is reduced a blubbering sap who looks like the bastard brother of archie bunker while david prowse gets the shaft over an ego rift how about finally seeing jabba the hut oy pizza the hut in spaceballs was more menacing not to mention more interesting then there is the ludicrous emperor fights skywalker outro where the ol wizard cant even get his lightning fingers to close the deal this guy is the personification of the dark side of the force get this geezer some viagra now im really going to kill you luke really this time im not fooling okay so i was joking but this time im not take that no ah this eleventh jolt should work darn hold a second dont move yawn and vader whose pure evil up until this point would make asmodeus blush suddenly sees the light has an epiphany in seconds and turns into albert schweitzer total character and audience betrayal the rest is history and its not worth mentioning so give it up fanboys and fangirls save your money or xmas gift slot and turn your wistful gaze to mr jackson if you want fantasy filmmaking integrity hes the real new hope despite its flaws lord of the rings should make george lucas eat his heart out if it hasnt shrunken too small to suffice as at least a dry hors doeurve go away george far far away and take your star wars movies with you 
i just picked up this dvd at a store the back of the box indicated the set had the classic star wars films digitally remastered and restored there was no mention that it also included the extra scenes inserted by lucas that have made these dvds so hated by the fans of the original triology so if youre like me and youve been waiting for lucas to re release the original triology this isnt it 
sep ap why not release both the originals and special editions on dvd lucas the special edition thats the one i wanted out there the other movie its on vhs if anybody wants it im not going to spend the were talking millions of dollars here the money and the time to refurbish that because to me it doesnt really exist anymore its like this is the movie i wanted it to be and im sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it but i want it to be the way i want it to be me i want i want i want thats george lucas for you when the issue is the original dvds a very big issue to fans george doesnt care what the fans want just what he wants that last line of his sums it all up to me the money and the time issues he brings up are sad excuses to say i lost a lot of respect for lucas would be a huge understatement 
 we all know the deal by now dont we first the regular edition will come out on blu ray then the remastered edition will come out on blu ray then the special edition will come out on blu ray then the remastered special edition will come out on blu ray then the extended edition will come out on blu ray then the extended remastered edition will come out on blu ray then the extended remastered special edition will come out on blu ray then the regular trilogy will come out on blu ray then the remastered trilogy will come out on blu ray then the remastered special trilogy will come out on blu ray then the extened edition trilogy will come out on blu ray then the remastered special extended trilogy edition will come out on blu ray i am sure we are all fed up with the way these greedy companies rip us off and george lucas is notorious for this just release the version we all want in the beginning and stop trying to take all our money we do not need fifteen versions of the same movie boycott we must all boycott 
it astonishes me that lucas continues to screw the consumer it took years for him to finally release a dvd star wars film and when he finally did he at least gave us the original series and not the computer edited farce re release though later he did do exactly that a blu ray disc can hold both versions of the film so why doesnt he just put both versions on the same disc please continue to give this one star and ask lucas and fox for what we all really want the original trilogy as they were released as the title suggests star wars original trilogy thanks loyal fans 
if you would like to see the films you grew up with dont buy this set instead go to ebay and get the faces vhs box set for around thirty bucks the faces boxset was the last time the original untampered with classic films were released on video and it will very likely be the last time if youre hung up on obtaining dvd versions of these great films then splurge for laserdisc dont like the jingly little ditty at the end of jedi special edition neither do i nor do i want to see hayden replace sebastian shaw the one true anakin whose face remains the one luke poors his soul out too in the feigning moments of the film even in this new edition make sense no it doesnt neither does the wooden acting in clones or jar jar binks for that matter but that is an entirely other rant whats next tweaking hamills seventies shag for a more updated look i mean really my point is dont waste your money on a pointless rehash of an already great work get copies of the originals while theyre still on the market and enjoy this awesome trilogy for what it is an incredible piece of filmmaking that taught the world how to dream 
just confirmed the actual movies have been altered more so than before i was fine w most of the revisions to the original trilogy but this is just tooooo much ive never said or agreed with a tactic like boycott but by god we should all boycott this travesty and show lucas in one epic stand that were sick of this nonsense everyone who pre ordered this like i had even if you dont find out about the changes before you get it dont for one second think youre stuck with it return it the return shipping is pre paid dont stick yourself with this garbage when you dont have to this is false advertising in its truest simplest form because this time doesnt even advertise that there were changes made to the film ps the moviefone website has already posted the actual revised video clips new release info regarding some of these changes im just thankful i learned this before it was shipped to me let alone before i laid eyes and ears on these horrific idiotic changes indiana jones should have been enough of an indicator to people that lucas had truly gone absolutely insane for any hold outs these sets should cement that stance i liked the southpark episode regarding this very matter which aired several years ago i thought it was a little overboard but now i get it it was right on the money which ironically isnt even how it was meant as it was meant to be a little over the top whod have thunk it southpark telling the future in accurate detail only in this case its han luke and the fans being bent over the pinball machine 
i dont want to write a book because so many others have already pointed out all the damages to this once upon a time masterpiece ok i will anyway computer erased actors for the sake of continuity with three new and inferior films re recorded sound effects audio everything from monster roars to new dubbed in dialogue for c po darth vader etc etc etc even the original music seems remixed under the action its completely lost its charm i absoloutely hate them and have been complaining to anyone around me wholl listen actually audio wise a new hope is almost unwatchable i had to switch off the it doesnt work it sounds like old audio jumping back and forth between new over dubbed audio or something really awful and distracting there is an old old saying if isnt broken dont fix it well george its time to give your old fans the ones who made your career a break and re release the original untampered versions of these films even as a limited edition box set seperate from all this cgi garbage hell its even more money for you anyway we dont want this you changed our lives with breath taking films odd years ago you cant go back its territory you already conquered so whats the point 
there is no way i will purchase another box set if i only get the altered version sorry georgie boy i dont want to see the epic scene of darth saving his son ruined with some cheesy screaming dialog fear leads to anger anger leads to hate and i hate that you change things in a trilogy thats years old maybe you could just update the original unbastardized version to bluray 
heres the deal when you do something like erase a mat line or add blinking to ewoks it doesnt hurt the movie it helps it when you add dialog or change the sequence of events it changes the movie and its impact so while im all for the special edition changes like expanding cloud city or fixing bad effects shots things like making vader say nooo in jedi by clearly using the same exact piece of audio that was in episode iii are stupid and hurt the impact of the film the films were fine as they were if you want to polish the effects because you couldnt do so in fine but changing the context of scenes it just hurts the legacy of these films the vader sequence at the end of jedi that has been changed was one of the few perfect moments in that film throwing in the nooo from episode iii is cheesy and makes no sense its like lucasfilm has never seen or understands the emotional impact of scenes 
in a way its sad that mr lucas is so tied to this trilogy that hes refused to do anything creative for years since the films were originally released im dismissing raiders because as i recall it was a co creation and not solely lucas besides which only the first of the four indy films is worth owning imo but i digress as so many others have noted here mr lucas seems unable to just move on he chooses instead to re edit and re f k the same movies again and again the fans who grew up with these films arent interested in this just as we are not interested in a new version of jaws in which chief brody goes into the belly of the shark and hollows it out from the inside just as were not interested in a new version of alien in which we find out that ripleys ancestors had actually fought off an alien hive and the aliens motive in destroying the crew of the nostromo was a blood vendetta just let it end george suffice to say ill be saving my money for a blu ray release thats worth waiting for not this revamped nonsense 
do you want to buy these edited shells of their former selves blu ray original trilogy abomination versions nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo thank you darth vader george relax buddy 
why must we have our childhood memories twisted and shattered why can we fondly remember the awesome special effects that help revolutionize movie making for generations lucas you used to be cutting edge and innovative stop being greedy and give the fans what we want i dont care for your changes i dont want your changes 
i distinctly remember thinking after seeing empire that lucas was an exceptional movie maker with very high standards this started to unravel with return of the jedi when literally at the time of reading the synopsis going up the screen when i first saw the movie after release i read that there was alas another death star being built i remember thinking oh no weve seen this before why do we have to see this same thing again i remember feeling unsatisfied by return of the jedi how cheap it felt compared to the first two amazing films then lucas comes out with special editions that add cgi which look ridiculous like watching a video game we then see in episode that lucas in order to avoid real human conflict introduces droid armies to avoid having to make his movie like a real war he then further ruins the franchise by making the clones cgi too as opposed to making the costume and having to deal with the hard work of live action scenes more video game i was a young lad when star wars came out and i watched in the theatre when han shot first and remembered thinking he was bad dude but by the end of the movie he had changed watching han shoot first and watching ben kenobi cut the arm off of someone in the bar did not make me crazy nor any of my school friends i knew the movie was make believe but it was fun to pretend in the end the sad truth is that george lucas reached his pinnacle with empire and was never the same again but why he has to completely ignore the brilliance of the first two movies by ignoring their proper restoration is puzzling he is who he is today a different man than he was when he made those first two films maybe its the divorce he went through back then has deeply effected him whatever the reason well probably never get to see those first two movies in their original glory restored and that truly is a shame rev the video game up 
i was very excited about the original movies coming out on dvd but upon seeing them i was utterly shocked at the tweaking that lucas has done with his original star wars movies they were absolutely perfect the way they were and the special effects were perfect for their time but whatever these special editions were aiming for they miss delivering by a mile now dont get me wrong special edition or not these are masterpieces without a doubt but after three or four versions of this trilogy being released on the soon to be out of print vhs editions i am absolutely tired of waiting and waiting for the dvd editions of the originals to surface there was nothing wrong with them and to see him do this to us is really saddening and has badly tarnished my respect for his lack of attention to his gargantuan fanbase to release these classics in their unedited versions on dvd why why why i mean the revamped versions are really excellent but the new cgi effects are so out of place with the much older versions of the movies special effects of the late s and early s this is ridiculous okay so maybe he wasnt one hundred percent pleased with the results of the originals but come on earth to lucas earth to lucas you should have looked at the way they did the alien quadrilogy where they had both the original versions of the films along side the special editions of each plus tons of bonus features the star wars trilogy dvd is deficient in every possible way having really lame bonus materials i have had it with his act of denying us star wars fans our chance to see the untouched originals cleaned up and remastered in their original forms and now i simply give up on ever seeing the original versions of this trilogy on dvd this was lucas chance to really come up with a grand spectacular dvd set but he totally blew it do not buy this dvd stick with your vhs editions out 
thats all i just want the original trilogy without all the cgi garbage lucas can retire the special editions because no one but him enjoys them 
we all love the original star wars movies dont we well most of us at least these are not the original movies they are tidied up versions with extra scenes the cleaning up of the special effects is effective in places however the extra content is not what has been done is to add ridiculous ill fitting cgi sequences in order to prepare us for the lamentably poor prequels we get a daft sequence of han solo talking to a cgi jabba which looks like a college graphics project worst of all is the new song and dance routine in return of the jedi which makes fraggle rock look like west side story a digitally remastered version of the original movies would be unmissable these tacky cash ins should be left in the bargain bin along with the colorised versions of black white classics 
yet another childhood memory overly destroyed google darth vader no and look for the link on the pocket lint site if you dont know what im talking about thanks for nothing george lucas 
sad that george lucas is not finished screwing up his brilliant first three movies please george can you give us the theatrical versions i dont want all the extra crud thats been added to it i just want a cleaned up version of what i watched when i was a kid i know the planyou bring out the abortion version so that everyone buys it then once the sales flatten out you bring out the special super edition with extra crud when they sell flat then you bring out what people actually want instant x sales well sorry im not buying 
i will not purchase any star wars product until lucas provides the original three movies with a quality transfer in blu ray and by original i mean the original version that i watched in theaters years ago 
the star wars prequels were terrible the original trilogy was great but when i see them prequelized in their current versions it just makes me think of those awful episodes i keep trying to forget im with everyone else not buying this revised crap 
george lucas and th century fox are at it again this time its a limited affair with the star wars trilogy limited edition debuting december th these dvd boxed sets will be the special editions presented in both full and widescreen the only difference between these new releases and the previous dvd release seems to be the dvd cover art also the th bonus disc will not be included will lucas and fox succeed in yet another shrewd delve into the consumer pocket only you can make that decision come this december the star rating goes to what appears to be another greed scheme concocted by lucas and th century fox there is absolutely nothing wrong with the current set now available unless youre an original trilogy purist and theres nothing wrong with that star wars itself will always receive high marks from me but its creator and distributor are leaving consumers with a bitter taste it may seem like smart business to continue milking the life out of a great product but sooner or later the cow has to get tired 
i am a huge star wars fan sure there are bigger but im up there i know that george lucas hesitates a while to release his films on dvd on the vhs its hard to find a wide screen copy so i picked up the pan and scan version i just want the original star wars in widescreen with the deleted scenes as a special feature on the dvd and restored and remastered picture and sound surround pretty pretty please mr lucas lucasfilm created an awesome dvd for episode so why do we have to wait until for the original trilogy george lucas youre an awesome filmmaker but you have to realize that dvd is superior to vhs you showed us that in episode one great films though 
i am officially boycotting this release as a fan of the original trilogy in their theatrical released forms it really aggrivates me that george lucas refuses to release them and treat them the same way hes treating his totally inferior new versions in fact i think he wants to act like they dont exist anymore that is unexceptable to me i will not buy this set or any other stars wars blu ray set unless the original trilogy is released why cant george lucas just release this a blu ray boxset of the original trilogy in their original theatrical released forms all cleaned up and treated with the upmost respect in terms of picture and sound quality bonus disc s of all the bonus features from the original trilogy like deleted scenes making of featurettes etc why is that so difficult thats all i want thats all millions of fans want there are many of us that only enjoy the original trilogy and are not fans of the new trilogy or the new versions of the original trilogy 
dont get me wrong im one of the original dyed in the wool star wars fanatics i was eight years old when i saw star wars in the theater for the first time and like millions of other people became an overnight lifelong fan bought all the action figures and toys had the posters on my walls the whole nine yards looked at another way im part of the considerable fan base that elevated george lucas to the lofty position hes in today as the head of lucasfilm ltd a position that affords him complete control over these releases that said i wont be buying these dvds yes star wars is one of the greatest trilogies of all time yes its one of the most important cinematic milestones in the history of the medium in terms of its box office success and its influence so why am i calling no joy i see no need to lay down my money for what are arguably remakes of the classic movies i fell in love with as a child not that i mind the new special effects additions i can understand why lucas might want to pump up the fx to make these films more visually appealing to newer generations of moviegoers who are far more jaded than i was in the late s but these so called enhanced versions arent the versions i care about what adds to the disappointment is the fact that the dvd medium is capable of containing both the enhanced versions and the classic versions allowing viewers to choose whichever they want but do we get that luxury no instead were asked to placate ourselves with the remade versions now and then spend even more money down the road to buy the classic versions in some ultimate edition the version these dvds should have contained from the very beginning at least im assuming the classic versions will be released at a later date i dont know that for sure people even devout fans dont like being jerked around that way lucas has already made his fans wait a long long time for this dvd release im very disappointed to see that the thanks we get for our patience is to be told he expects us to buy this on dvd not once but twice sorry but no i own these movies on vhs and will continue to watch them in that format for an equally long time to come lessons to lucas and the rest of hollywood dont mess with a cultural icon if you cant follow lesson at least dont deny true fans the classic version of a film 
we love star wars we love it as we remember seeing it in the theaters the special editions were fun i have them i dont want them on blu ray want to include them alongside the original versions fine but dont ignore your fans by ignoring them you are caving in to your worst instincts as an entertainer and as an artist to do your art for you and you alone and that is a very sad state of affairs releasing the original uncut restored versions on blu ray would be a love letter to all your fans a thank you note for putting you on the map as a director and one of the foremost science fiction writers of the th and st centuries we did together you worked hard and we ate it up seeing the movie several times in the theaters buying every version whenever you released it on every format now that blu ray is up the task and you are still alive and able to work on it commit to us that you will do what we ask please we are in no position to demand it but we are in a position to respectfully request it thanks in advance lifelong star wars fan 
i am another wishing for a hd version of the original prints george said he doesnt have them any longer and i am inclined at this point to not believe him yes these are his movies and yes he can do as he wishes with them which he has again and again and again but to ignore the original originals to say there is not enough interest is both short sighted and arrogant this isnt an issue of messing with someones childhood memories star wars was a game changer for the industry and for people who still love it enough years later to cry foul people who have well lined lucas pockets with their so called lack of interest the last star wars copies i bought were the definitve laserdisc collection years ago and thats not likely to change anytime soon 
i just found out these are the improved versions of the trilogy i was so excited to buy these and now i will not i too belive george lucas is wither extremely selfish or extremely smart i think it may be the ladder i think he will get everyone to buy this junk then later on release the real versions of these movies so everyone will have to buy them again 
i grew up with these movies having seen a new hope in theaters when it was first released at age this is not the original trilogy lucas keeps altering the films now hes digitally editing out actors and altering the plot lucas doesnt understand that the fans love the movies the way they originally were even with all the flaws he did a good job at cleaning these movies up but there are lots of additional effects hes added that are subpar hes also done some color correcting that in some places has made the picture worse notice in the space battle that opens a new hope that when the imperial ship passes above the planet below it not only do the engines glow blue the planet below glows blue too its apparent that some processes in the restoration of these movies received much more time and resources than others i wish lucas would come to his senses and release the true original trilogy bugs dirt errors and all if they can release the alien quadrilogy with versions of each movie lucas can do the same hes certainly not hurting for funds mr lucas give the fans what they want unaltered and unadulterated 
lets see when vhs was king george lucas came out with the trilogy when laserdisc replaced the vhs he came out with the trilogy too then thx was developed and he produced the thx editions then he rereleased the films worldwide a little after that then another marketing guerilla in the form of the prequels came out and boy did it stink and tolkien kicked its butt to boot now on the eve of lucas final curtain that is episode he tries to milk us with the finally this but then i expect these editions down the road episode trilogy superbit collection episode the complete edition episode separated episode directors cut with apparently secret never before shown footage inserted in the movie episode directors cut episode producers cut episode best boy grips cut episode harrison fords caterers cut episode with toy inside episode with preview of episode star wars return of the capitalist jedi 
just unfair and purposely so if youre gonna do something like this and wait so long to do it at least do it right but no we wait all this time to finally have the original true versions of the first star wars films on dvd and its not even the best transfer they could easily provide us lucas should be slapped with a thick wad of his own money 
the edits and all of the special edition parts in this movie are garbage i ended up getting ripped copies of the laserdisc version since he refuses to accept money for what im willing to pay for good job georgie 
i will never purchase the original trilogy until it is the actual original trilogy first and foremost its false advertising to claim this is the original trilogy and then muck it up with different scenes ill stick it out with the thx digital mastered vhs tapes thank you very much 
this seems to be a bootleg edition of the movies someone seemed to have made a new movie spliced in scenes from the original trilogy whoever did this should be arrested for making such bad movies then trying to sell them under the star wars name avoid these at all costs 
i dont understand why george lucas refuses to give fans a high quality transfer release of the original theatrical cuts of the star wars trilogy for those of us who dont like the tweaks the lame revisions han shot first or the overdubbing i liked the original boba fett thanks very much this release is just another slap in the face to film buffs historians and preservationists they say if you whitewash something long enough people will cease to remember it sadly thats what lucasfilm seems to want to do whitewash the superior versions of the star wars films until newer generations dont know any better shame 
changes changes and more changes lucas is to be tarred and feathered the blu ray version of has some horrible corrections and additions that spoil it for me not buying 
its the release with all the release problems in slightly higher resolution with new problems yay thanks george ill stick with my old vhs tapes i guess 
no thanks ill keep my memories 
you know lucas can do whatever he wants to his movies they are his creations they are his artistic vision where he is wrong though is not including the original versions and remastering them for hi def as an option no other filmmaker has done what he has which is basically not acknowledging the existance of the original version yes these are his movies but they also belong to us the fans because the fans support and love for these films made it the phenomena that it is sorry mr lucas but i will not be ordering these ill stick to the laser discs you know on second thought all these changes since the special editions til now have only made them consistent with the mediocrity of the prequels i always believed that the original trilogy existed in its own parallel universe separate from the six episode series anyway sort of a mirror universe version of star wars which is fine the george lucas of is certainly not the george lucas of so these new versions of star wars should be called star wars the rise and fall and redemption of anakin skywalker which is the way lucas sees these films as nowadays the original trilogy should exist as star wars the adventures of luke skywalker which i believe was the original conceptualization of the series this if i remember correctly was used for the original novelizations of the trilogy darth vader was always a much more interesting character when his origins were a mystery and only hinted at this only enhanced his legend mythology and aura which is why everybody loved this character in the first place he was essentially a sci fi version of the boogie man the original trilogy made him the pop culture icon that he was unfortunately these special edition versions basically broke down dart vader into something a lot less lucas essentially made him into some gifted and whiny kid who was screaming out for help this is fine if that is what lucas wants of course but as i said earlier give the fans the option of which version they want to see there is no reason why they cant both exist it is a big universe anyway what i would like to see in an original trilogy blu ray set restored unaltered versions of the trilogy with cleaned up effects and original sound mixes as an option deleted scenesoriginal making of documentaries star wars to jedi documentaryempire of dreams documentarystar wars holiday special restored and remastered vintage interviews with cast and crewaudio commentariesnew documentary on the star wars phenomena from a s early s point of view which includes vintage toy commercials actor and character appearances on such shows as donnie and marie the richard pryor show the muppet show etc and interviews with illuminaries and fans of the period new documentary on the merchandising bonanza of the series promotional art and trailers
if george lucas feels these classics need adjustments thats his decision to make do whatever you want with them mr lucas just make sure that the millions of people who made you rich and loved the movies just the way they originally were are able to choose which versions to watch but that simply is not the case and while ill be the first person to admit theyre just movies im still upset and sad about these dvds the original version of any movie should be respected and preserved the ground breaking work provided by hundreds of people who were part of the crew really deserves to be remembered not replaced not just the crew in fact because now even original cast members have been jettisoned the origninal emperor from empire has been removed sebastian shaws final appearance at the end of jedi is gone and the actor who spoke boba fetts lines has been excised its disgraceful i understand lots of people are just happy to have the star wars trilogy on dvd in any form not me 
when peter jackson and new line released the lord of the rings on dvd they got their money back and then some first they released the theatrical version then some months later they released an extended version and that disc also included the original theatrical release people were steamed but many both the whole kit a second time but george lucas wont do that why because he owns the whole thing from start to finish hes the annoying studio head he has to deal with that still leaves the question of why he doesnt even want to just make some extra money the answer is straightforward nobody thinks his extended version is better if he were to release the original theatrical sales of the lucas new and improved would drop to zero and lil ol george just cant bear the thought that his franchise took a nosedive straight down the toilet he jumped the shark screwed the poodle you named he did it screwed it blew it he knows it but a few billion dollars buys you a lot of denial 
i like most everyone else on here simply want the original trilogy in high def i dont understand why george lucas is so damned stubborn he has to know by this point how many people want to see his classic original trilogy in pristine widescreen editions the paltry un anamorphic unrestored dvd extras included on the last set just didnt cut it i just dont understand the mans logic if he were to include both versions in this set then he would sell many more copies and everyone would be happy its basically as if he wants to rid the world forever of his original works and thats truly sad i realize that these new versions contain his supposed original vision but they are not the versions that so many millions of his fans grew to love and cherish all of their lives that ought to count for something in his mind i also understand that the films are his creations and he has the right to tamper with them as he sees fit but they were never self indulgent films to begin with as he has made them now it strikes me as very unfair to give something as monumental as the star wars films to the public only to yank them away change them into entirely different entities and then toss them back in what he obviously considers superior but what many fans feel are quite inferior editions i am not expecting anything to change from any of these amazon reviews million negative reviews probably wouldnt change the mans mind he doesnt need more money he already has more cash than god fans of the originals can only hope that he will eventually one day see the light either that or when he finally dies maybe his estate will do the right thing in my opinion to have such important films as the star wars trilogy only readily available in these silly new editions is a truly a travesty 
i know its tempting to buy but these will not be the theatrical cuts or the s re releases these wont even be the ses these arent the films we grew up with im hearing lucas may tamper with these films even more for the blu release keep in mind that he didnt even direct empire and jedi two other guys did one was his instructor in college and the other died years before the ses were released this guy has no scruples none whatsoever as much as i wanted to like these ses i cant they arent the same movies anymore and the changes stick out like a sore thumb dont buy these discs if enough people refuse to purchase them maybe hell grow thick skin and accept that he made a mistake by denying movie lovers everywhere the original versions he should also apologize for being such a liar telling us no high quality prints of the original star wars exist when there are im not buying and neither should you dont be this guys fool anymore when people say they want the original star wars he likes to split hairs but he knows exactly what we want and he can easily give it to us 
i was extremely disappointed to learn that this release will not be of the original versions but instead the inferior special editions in which lucas added new digital special effects and altered scenes to make them more politically correct such as greedo now shooting first before hes taken out by hans solo im not sure i understand why lucas didnt include both versions on the discs like speilberg did with his recent release of et im going to pass on this release and stick to my old vhs versions of the originals 
star wars was the first movie i ever saw in a theater and i remember it to this day all i want to do is relive that magic in high definition i dont want to see his original vision or any such nonsense i simply want to relive a fantastic movie in the format we all originally saw it and fell in love with it and id like to relive it in hd 
i saw an interview with lucas claiming that artists during the renaissance painted over their own work or added to it all the time he used this as justification for why he adds to his original star wars films lucas doesnt seem to understand that those artists did so for time and space reasons they didnt get a new type of paintbrush and add in a joke or two to their piece they didnt get new types of paint and make their past creations into cliches thats what he has done its a nerd with a hobby a billion dollar hobby that he can play around with he forgets the people who made him and why then makes it worse by acting like they are fools stay away from this until someone decides to remaster the original theatrical pieces and put them out all we are doing is feeding the billion dollar hobby with terrible added music effects and high jinks 
i remember the first time i watched the special edtition star wars movies i didnt really see anything that made them better then i got to the return of the jedi when that fuzzball thing started singing and dancing across the screen i wanted to throw up if george lucas wants to turn the original star wars trilogy into musicals for children i have no problem with that he created the movies he has every right to do so but for him to say im ruining the star wars movies and im going to force everyone to watch these abominations is outrageous this basically means he made it so everyone who doesnt enjoy watching pure crap wont every buy his movies again its sad but whatever im sure there will be plenty of science fiction movies out there that arent directed towards year olds i would suggest looking into those instead of this mockery of a good trilogy 
i would rather have a choice of which version of these films to watch lucas says the original versions quot dont exist quot really i seem to remember watching them many times as a child i know my parents spent quite a bit of money for me to do so but they dont exist does this mean my parents get their money back hey george you may have built the empire but we paid for it the least you could do is let us decide which version is best 
as much as i have a distaste for lucas over the last years since that first abomination of a special edition came out i have to think that fox is just as guilty of tapping the well here case in point look how aliens blu ray was handled initially an expensive set with basically the same special features as the two disc special editions from or so only to release the individual films on blu ray months later with no special features i would almost be willing to bet money that the original versions will hit blu ray in a year even then i will never give lucas another dime of my money ever again 
why does george lucas hate his fans so much the same fans that made him a billionaire and help fund his skywalker ranch ilm and other business ventures of his is it too much to ask that he remaster the original unaltered theatrical releases of the original trilogy a lot of the charm of the theatrical releases was the traditional model work props and costumes of the era but lucas would rather bastardize his work than to let it stand for all time and what about the actors that have been erased such as the voice of boba fett or sebastian shaw who got replaced at the end of jedi by that no talent hayden christensen his contemporaries such as francis ford coppola ridley scott and steven spielberg have all put out special editions of apocalypse now blade runner and close encounters of the third kind respectively the difference is they each included the original theatrical release either through seamless branching or included on a separate disc why does lucas refuse to do this i am sure he would sell twice as many if he did until he finally releases the original cuts and i am not talking as a low quality bonus disc from an old laser disc i want fully restored with loss less hd audio i will not buy 
just bought me a used laserdisc player and ebayd a used copy of the original star wars trilogy in widescreen on laserdisc ya know the one where han shot first no ridiculous cgi interspersed with model effects and other obnoxious changes ill be enjoying the untouched and unmolested versions that i remember from my childhood and you know what mr lucas i spent nearly twice what amazon is charging for these dvds i hope you and your distribution company understand what that means in terms of lost revenue because im not alone this coming from a male in his mid thirties with a six figure income im a good representative of your target demographic now offended and totally alienated you blew it buddy heres to market forces giving you a well deserved clue smack 
what did we do to deserve this george lucas the old version of these movies were fine that is why you have millions of dollars are you so bored that you feel that you have to fix things that arent broke all us fans really wanted was to have clean brand new dvd versions of the original theatrical releases and you have to deny us that wasnt attack of the clones and phantom menace enough punishment we dont need new scenes with all this computer graphic stuff in it save it for your new movies im not even a huge fan of star wars but this dvd set upsets me for all of your hardcore fans i should go get my laserdisc player fixed because thats the only way ill be able to see the original movies on a disc oh by the way i cant wait till revenge of the sith comes out yeah right 
hey george look lets sit down and talk about this really okay please restore the original trilogy you released in respectively on blu ray if you please you dont have to admit wrong doing with that other thing you know the special editions i just torched in my back yard give han solo his character arc back so i can pretend to be worried that our heroes are getting in with the wrong crowd you know we understand you felt like your property was being taken from you but that doesnt mean you have to tit for tat all of us well still get behind you on these new movies man but you see everyone was there when you released the original trilogy we remember how it was so george we love ya man just quit being so high and mighty and find that little independent filmmaker in you that says its okay to be wrong every once in a while no big deal were so behind you man it will be historic when you release the original original trilogy on blu ray we wont rub it in your face or anything 
just be warned these are not the original trilogy films the best quality of the original trilogy is the non widescreen letterboxed japanese laserdisc version available on dvd because that is the highest quality the original trilogy has been released period 
george george george say it aint so how can you change and mess up a classic trilogy i know youre the director and all but damn what a critical mistake ive been a fan of the real star wars since i was a little boy and now learning of this st dvd set has been changed on purpose is very disappointing ap hardcore fans already know this but these are the special edition upgrades reissued to theaters in the late s w extra scenes and augmented effects and creatures lucas considers those the definitive versions he would have made initinally if he had the time money and technology and he has no intention of releasing the original versions im a true fan of your thx audio technology star wars video games and of this series george just not the new star wars but the real wars all the real fans remember love i wont buy this garbage no matter the cost sorry pal mr lucas has joined the dark side very sad give us the originals please 
if you are a long time star wars fan when they were around in the s you should know better the prequels sucked the cgi looked cgi the miniatures in original trilogy looked more real the acting in the prequels were horrible sigh i dont know the only thing i did liked in the prequels were the jedi sith sword fights scenes thats about it i love the original trilogy and i consider them to be masterpieces george i know the original trilogy was not your true vision and of course you own the rights and theyre your movies but once you change something that is not cool not cool at all those are the films we grew up with which are the originals films dont do no more changes please they are fine the way they are no more cgi learn from ridley scott who is releasing like different versions of blade runner now thats how you do business thats how you give the public to choose from the public needs wants the old classics back please release the original star wars in anamorphic widescreen with surround sound i want to make you rich dont you want that then do it right make the public happy make us star wars fans satisfied otherwise were going to boycott the limited edition thats coming in september unless you do things right for the fans got it good buenas noches 
this impending re release of the same dvds is sure to infuriate fans but is this surprising to anyone nope lucasfilm is a business and george lucas is all about business not about the fans but to sell more product what is it the fans want the original unaltered trilogy but with remastered picture and sound and special features galore including deleted scenes sure lucasfilm could easily do this creating a true ultimate edition but these flimsy re releases still sell so if they release the ultimate edition especially on blu ray these fans will have all they want lucasfilm will sell these well but it doesnt bode well for the future thats why they continue to sell these on dvd only and in about five years as another on amazon has commented on they will finally come to blu ray but i guarantee it they will only be the special edition versions that the fans do not want its the never ending cycle 
we were all willing to overlook the silly ewoks they were entirely too adorable and obviously aimed at getting the most out of your merchandizing options but at least they added a little something to the storyline then jar jar happened and jar jar begot boss nass who begot an implausibly mobile jabba the hut jabba begot watto who begot sebulba sebulba begot fodesinbeed and the whole franchise became a thick gummy cgi mess then it seemed you couldnt stop yourself you ran rabid plastering layers of gooey cgi scene hoggery all over the heretofore flawless originals soon the ultimate saga of goods triumph over evil became half a bucket of popcorn mixed with the sweepings of your last beard trim all spilled on the sticky theater floor unrecognizable and something to be avoided please george we made you filthy stinking criminally rich were not asking you to kill jar jar or recast anakin although both are worthy requests cmon christensen was awful all we ask is that you remaster the originals exactly as they appeared in theaters and re release them on blu ray please 
again crummy altered versions of star wars no thanks period once they release the real theatrical versions i will not waste a dime on these collections
does not include the movies i saw as a kid in the theater picture and sound are good but its still not the original movies you will buy it anyhow 
note this review is not about the trilogy which is great this review is about the many dvd releases the worst thing that ever happened to george lucas is when peter jackson released the extended version of lotr jackson showed fans we could demand expect and receive more from hollywood the impact of peter jackson sent shock waves among fans who released a four disc edition of one of the greatest movies of all time even old hollywood guards like ridley scott and james cameron no surprise they are not americans took notice and improved their dvd releases this change has been powerful except in the case of lucas and to some degree his pal steven spielberg who continues to stick to their old habits by being dinosaurs when it comes to business and satisfying the consumers the many re releases shows greediness stubbornness and lack of respect for fans no one is upset with him for cleaning up the original version but please allow fans to have the version and the updated version with better picture and sound quality in addition please stop using the limited edition you like to use to get fans to buy new copies of star wars it is both false and tiring release these films in anamorphic widescreen with surround sound and allow the version of the movie be release lucass creditability has gone downhill to some degree because he is only known for his star war movies unfortunately his latest releases have only damaged him further because the quality of the prequels has been less than stellar his shady practice of video dvd releases of his past glory has resulted in some fans losing respect for him one must wonder what went through lucas mind when peter jackson won an academy award for best director and not him maybe if he focus on making quality films like he once did and not playing the dvd re re re release game then he could win one 
im sorry does lucasfilm think that people will buy anything just because it has star wars written on it well maybe theyre right but im certainly not among them i already have the dvd versions with hayden christensen in jedi boba fett sounding like a goofy clown instead of an intimidating and mysterious figure a drastically darkened look overall with a strange blue tint other gaffes like pink lightsabers and a botched soundtrack not to mention all the crap that was added in including a pointless contradictory scene with jabba the hutt in star wars an even more pointless set of return of the jedi outtakes added to the end of empire disrupting the pacing greedo shooting at han solo and can you say new musical number in jabbas palace as it appears right now the blu ray will be the exact same versions with all the gaffes and bad alterations except it will be in hd resolution in other words you will be able to purchase the high definition versions shown on hbo but with better compression technology because of the weird color screwups and other errors the rear surround channels are swapped on a new hope that alone is more than enough justification for star i dont know about you but it doesnt seem worth amazon sale price just to upscale the versions i already have and dont want however a state of the art x hd transfer of the original and versions with all sound mixes would be a must own yes its true there will be new extras including the deleted scenes at last but those are not in this set if you want those you have to purchase the even more overpriced complete set that includes the prequels if youd rather have the original versions get this much cheaper ish set instead although not really labeled well the slim box set with luke and vader on the cover is basically the individual sets featuring the dvd version and commentary alongside the unaltered versions from and so six discs total star wars trilogyyou can also get the bonus disc from the set with the excellent empire of dreams documentary by itself for a very low price ish or less as well star wars trilogy bonus disc if you are only interested in the deleted scenes and other new extras like i am i would recommend renting the set and seeing if you can find a way to buy just the bonus discs separately 
george lucas enough is enough stop making money from star wars fans by continuingreleasing the same versions but in different boxes once again you are releasing yet another star wars blu ray dvd set with the same versions from previous discs releases stop this now and give what your star wars fans wants and they want theoriginal version without any added or extended editing we want the original release version and make sure that it is in blu ray people who are hard fans for star wars should not buy any more copies of copies and stop wasting your money for the same old thing be smart and dont buy this setuntil george lucas gets your messages demand the release of the original version until then may the trash get lost ps i hope george lucas will notice that i didnt say mr george lucas because i am beginning to lose respect for him 
 yes these changes mean that the star wars films are no longer the ones you saw years ago but these brief changes hardly affect the films and they do make sense in the overall continuity of the two trilogies its not like a digitized ewan mcgregor has replaced alec guinesss scenes no but he might as well have done i mean that too to alter what i consider to be the greatest film ever made the trilogy just so it meshes with the appaling excuses for films that the new star wars films are is something so wrong it beggars belief boba fett now has a south african accent no disrespect to sa haan solo blatantly speaks the same lines twice in the space of a few minutes just so we can see an obviously cgi jabba make a disgrace out of himself and worst of the worst of the worst they changed the ending unforgivable new boy haydn christensen what were they thinking getting this softie in to play one of the most infamous movie villains of all time has replaced anakins ghost the music has been changed and new scenes have been added showing absolutely rubbish for want of a ruder word cgi cities celebrating how would they know so quickly anyway its an abomination that almost made me throw the boxed set in the bin no joke you dont change the ending of a film not like this its appalling stay well away i hate saying that cos these are my favourite films but theyve been ruined by a past it george lucas vision of what star wars should look like they shouldnt have let him near his own material to ruin it they really shouldnt the george lucas of yesteryear would be turning in his proverbial grave please feel free to edit this paragraph out if its unacceptable but the one word that sums this boxed set up perfectly is this bastardisation nuff said 
i am not a huge star wars fan far from one i consider the original star wars films to be classics but my knowledge of the star wars universe is hardly up to expactations even so i consider lucass edits and changes to be offensive so all you psychologically abused elitists who rant on about lolo stop complainign star wers nerds can be quiet as one genius raves gorge lookas has teh artistic freedom he made teh movays not u very true he has the right to make his movies crap and we the consumers have the right to state the fact that these new special editions are crap everyone ive seen ranting on about artistic freedom completely miss the point because theyre too busy consuming lucass half ssed edited garbage overall lucas is an egomaniacal hack who refuses to put in minimal effort to please his real fans instead hed rather advertise his terrible prequels in the context of once great films and edit adulft contentw absolutely terrible i hope stuck up directors who respect themselves more than their real fans are in the minority id give this a zero if i could 
the best thing i can say about this version the special special edition is that george lucas cant come to my house and erase or change into special edition cr p the original trilogy set i have on vhs otherwise since star wars has been in trouble one day george lucas will die and some kid of his not happy with just the billion dollars his dad left him from running star wars into the ground will release the original trilogy on dvd and the circle truly will be complete the only things worse than the special and special special edition episodes and the real star wars rip
the marketers behind this blu ray set would like you to think youre getting hd quality prints of the original series ive been a star wars fan for all my life my fandom doesnt include any of the films or cartoons made since so i would love to purchase this piece of film history unfortunately this release includes only the remakes made in digitally touched edited and mangled throughout buying these far lesser quality versions of the movies would only feed the problem and prolong their release 
lucas continues to amaze his loyal fans with constant modifications to the original trilogies wow george youve done it again dont waste your time with this garbage hey george put the original trilogy released in theater on dvd not your messed up twisted dark side modifications on dvd lucas doesnt care about the loyal fans of the original trilogy that much is clear the dark side surrounds lucas beware of the dark side dont give in to hate that can lead to the dark side of the force if i had an option to give this travesty a zero or even negative stars i would ill stick with my original vhs tapes and ignore these pieces of trash dvds 
 to see this crap in d nor will we waste our hard earned cash on the jedi rocks music video turdfest and other abominations we done need male enhancement well most of us and we dont need star wars enhancements take away the plastic surgery and give us the al natural baby p s if i check this out from netflix and there is a pink lightsaber blade in jedi i am going to microwave the disk you turd lucas 
ill have to make do with my vhs special edition of the trilogy im not a big star wars fanatic but i do like the original trilogy i was looking forward to the dvd edition but now i wont be buying it and its all because lucas stuck hayden christensen in as anikins ghost at the end of jedi i dont want to be reminded of these god awful intelligence insulting overstuffed pointless eye candy every element calculated for merchandising or videogame hypercommercialized prequel products every time i watch the originals and especially jedi the prequels are taking three movies to explain that being a sullen moody teenager is enough to send someone to the dark side of the force i dont recognize the prequels as being on the same continuum as the originals and i think its outrageous that classic movies are being altered to match later films instead of the later ones being made to match the established ones id buy the first two originals on dvd if they become available separately but i refuse to have jedi and by extension the original trilogy ruined for me by tying it to these horrible prequels which bear the same relationship to the originals that a garfield cartoon has to a rembrandt if the lucas worshippers would take time out from admonishing everyone who doesnt share their enthusiasm to get over it get a life shut up suck it up go back to your parents basement their his mooviez dood and whatever else they might consider this it is the same guy who made so far two god awful prequel star wars parodies who decided on the changes to the original trilogy therefore his judgement can rightfully be questioned 
there is no way im going to purchase this bogus dvd set containing the special edition movies i have my vhs tapes of the original true versions backed up several times so ill enjoy those until lucas comes to his senses and releases those as well that egotystical cow could have easily put both on this dvd set hes not getting my cash for this insult 
i waited this long to buy them because i wasnt sure if the movies on dvd were the original ones or the remade special edition terrible ones well i looked on amazon and see that they are the remade ones and that means they suck the changes are horrible and stupid jabba looks nothing like he did in rotj when added into empire why oh why george lucas cant you be happy with your trillion dollars you made from star wars and quit messing it up jar jar anakin being years old in phantom menace yet amidala padme has feelings for him special edition of original trilogy suck stupid medichlorian stuff which demystifies the force anakin being borne of the force a la jesus jedis acting like moronic idiots in ep and i sense that we are idiots hiring the worst actors in the world for episodes and samuel l jackson natalie portman little anakin kid hayden christensen dammit even liam neeson who was always good before sucks as qui gonn only ewan macgregor and the emperor deserve any praise from the debacles that are ep and etc 
well my friends you may have heard the news george lucas and oth century fox are re releasing the star wars trilogy on dvd no its not the original classic trilogy that we all long for i sincerely wish it was as those are the movies that made me fall in love with star wars to begin with well not literally in love but you get the point no apparently lucas ego cant come to grips with releasing the movies that made his hiney famous to begin with the original movies untouched by lucas sometimes irritating tweaking no this set is the same exact set that was released last year the special editions only they have new packaging and the th bonus disc that was included with last years dvd set is not included with this set thats correct lucas and fox want you to spend over for a set that is without the th bonus disc that the last set had i e lucas wants you to fork over dollars for a new box thats it new packaging the packing looks much like the packing for the last set only the metallic silver black and gold black have been changed to the colors of the original star wars movie poster you can see the new packaging by going to is it worth over thats up to you but one question remains why why re release the same exact movies when the shelves of stores all across the world are still stocked with the original packaging why take the th bonus disc out of this set why charge people over just for a new box but with the same darn movies why not just release the originals instead of releasing the same darn special edition trilogy twice in two years it is easier to understand jar jar binks than it is to answer the questions asked above but if you use the force the answer will come to you yes come to you it will that answer m o n e yyes the answer is money lucas and fox have chosen to steal more dollars from their fans by redecorating the box that the same movies as last years release came in in hopes that youll fork over more money yes grinches lucas and fox are yes yes they could have given star wars fans the ultimate christmas dvd gift the original movies restored remastered for us to finally own and enjoy and for us to relive many fond memories with but those classic movies are not being released on dvd anytime in the near future in fact lucas says that he will not ever release them when the rumored ultimate star wars saga dvd set is released we may be able to see some deleted scenes from the original trilogy the ones that lucas removed years later we may have that to look forward to but then again this comes from a man who says that he cares about the people who made him a billionaire yet robs them of the movies that they do want and repackages the movies that they already have so that they will buy the darn things a year later thus the reason why the th disc has been removed it makes the set sell for only dollars rather than close to i e lucas and fox want to hypnotize as many fans as possible into buying this cheaper set for the holiday rush is it a coincidence that the dvds are being released december th not september th not january th no these dvds are being re released right square between thanksgiving and christmas when shoppers will be most busy they waited until star wars fans would go to the store and buy volume of the cool clone wars cartoon and they wanted to make us impulsively buy the movies that we impulsively bought two extra copies of a year ago they are looking for spur of the moment dollars if they cared for their fans they would have made this cheaper set available to us last year but then they would have lost that extra dollars and they couldnt allow that no they waited til they bled consumers dry on the last set before they threw the dvds in a new box and made them available in this set without the bonus disc of course i am mad about this granted there are more important things going on in the universe than a damn dvd set but this is an insult to star wars fans star wars movies have always been about values honor and integrity it is a shame that the maker and distributors of these films do not hold the same values honor and integrity they have become money whores like any other businessmen they are as greedy as boba fett negotiating on what a valued bounty should be worth to him its all about money star wars is a business to george lucas that is why he hasnt had a problem re doing many of the original movie scenes to him its just a job to him these are just movies the force is not strong in george lucas if it was he wouldnt throw these exact movies as last years dvd release in our faces and ask for over if the force was truly with lucas he would have done what spielberg did with e t released the original and special editions of the movies so that his vision and his fans memories could both be fulfilled mr lucas you have much to learn my old padawan the dark side is greed consume you it has forgotten who made your dreams come true you have otherwise you would have made our dreams come true and given us the movies that we have been dreaming of not the same movies in a new box grateful that is not ok no more yoda talk mr lucas you are wrong for re releasing these movies on dvd you just want people like me die hard star wars fans to fork over more dollars into your billionaire account and we will and i probably will too ill see the new packaging and say no this guy only wants money you have these movies already matt walk away but there is new packaging and the price is lower without the bonus disc well why not and our urge to relive those star wars memories will take us over and overshadow the reality that we are buying the movies because they appear different you know that and you let it occur anyway you use our very love of the movies that made you who you are and you use it to bleed even more and more money out of us palpatine would have been proud 
this garbage has to go george lucas needs to issue theatrical releases not his horrible attempts at changing these films after the fact including thx dont buy them if they dont sell as well as they should it couldnt make matters worse 
give me the originals anyday why mess up a good thing if its not broke dont fix it 
while im happy that i have my terrible transfer bonus disc versions of the original trilogy on dvd i dont understand why the studio that released such excellent box sets for the alien saga on blu which included both theatrical and altered versions of all four films can not do a similar release for the star wars trilogy many mention the terrible changes to star wars to be a little different ill talk about empire changing a line spoken to a robot from youre lucky you dont taste very good to youre lucky to be alive adding that goofy scream when luke plummets to his fate which i heard they then took out and put back in softened and who knows what will be on this release the terrible re edit with flash cuts and cg imperial shuttle in the last minutes of the movie taking the time to cg up all the effects but still not getting rid of the blue screen artifact boxes around the asteroids and tie fighters i mean if youre going to fix it then go ahead and fix it not that i mind the boxes they were a product of when the movie was made and i like that i like time capsules on film which is exactly why i dont like the special editions so yeah fox lucas wont be getting my money until the original theatrical versions of the trilogy gets a proper release on blu if its not better than the blurry sub standard ones they already put out on dvd ill still be saving my money 
heck thank god he had nothing to do with anything else except star wars i know theres indiana jones but i think its safe to say that spielberg wont let him ruin that too thats what the new fans cant understand about us who cant stand the new versions its not just that hes creating new effects its that hes ruining the experience by destroying the original they cant understand it because it hasnt happened to them yet to love something for decades realizing that you contributed to enlarge its creators bank account and to hear from his own mouth that that thing you once loved doesnt exist anymore simply because he feels like butchering it those who think hes right should be aware that by endorsing this action they might fall victim of someone else doing the same with something they love in the future then they will understand speaking about george lucas i really cant understand him on one side it looks like all he cares about is profit on the other he reduces said profit by alienating many if not most of the people who helped him built his own empire maybe all he wants is to generate discussion so he can be just as famous as his creation i dont know so lets just be thankful all he can ruin are the star wars movies can you imagine the atrocities lucas would have done to films like casablanca to fit with the star war films he would probably turn all the soldiers into imperial troopers replace louis armstrong with some childish cgi character and change the title to mos eisley that would be the day 
i join in with those who say that theyre just asking for remastered copies of the original versions that were offered prior to the s when all sorts of changes were made other filmmakers have taken their classic movies and restored them and offered them on dvd even if they made extended cuts director cuts or special cuts they all included the earlier versions as well giving customers that option is king george going to offer up the originals in remastered form only when his stock starts dropping then i hope people truly wise up and stop forking over money for movies they already have on dvd i for one refuse to buy these new offerings 
i was a college student when star wars was first released so i was part of the phenomenon that grew up around the film and its sequels and feel almost obligated to comment i saw the original at least a dozen times on campus after all it was tailor made for us college kids figure it out over time i believed that when these hit dvd they would be instant treasures but no we had to go thriugh the re release and re edited versions and then when we finally got them the true versions were non anamorphic maybe there is a newer generation that doesnt care but like others out there i really think mr lucas dropped the ball on this one the topic has been discussed ad infinitum all over the net and he no doubt is aware of the outcry regarding the original trilogy we are not going to change his mind i do hope he does reconsider though as there will be huge profit to be made should he put the originals out anamorphically if its money he wants this will fill his pockets as to this set well if you dont have them otherwise i hate to disrespect mr lucas but i have to agree why bother im a huge fan but without the originals in anamorphic im done with star wars 
after all these years of waiting and anticipation for what was said to be the greatest dvd release of all time looks like its going to be the biggest disapointment of all time judging by what the features says it looks as if there only releasing one of the greatest trilogys of all time in the newer so called remastered editions george lucas promised this wait was going to be worthwhile and yet he has completly ignored the fans that have kept him in his status of where he is today and decided not to actualy make a great dvd release instead he has chosen to release not only just the newer versions he is releasing them in both widescreen and full screen my pet peeve is not only with that but would it be so hard to have both wide screen and full screen on the one disc especially seeing as how theres only going to be audio extras on the discs anyway but no lucas films wouldnt want to give back to the fans somthing worth while now would they my second pet peeve is one that i have read so many have agreed with me on and thats the original presentation of the films for years they have said that this dvd release would be the best release ever well looks like there not going to live up to that expectation why couldnt they include both formats of the movies why cant they have an option on them that says veiw original presentation or veiw special edition that would make every body happy wouldnt you think or even flip side discs one side could have the original and one side have the newer so called improved digitly remastered movies wouldnt that sound more like somthing to look foraward to instead lucas has completly lost it with this the bonus features arnt looking like anything worth looking forward to its possible but i doubht he would include things like when a few of the cast members where on the muppet show or various other tv appearences heck the bonus disc should be a flip side too and come with the battle of endore and caravan of courage the two forgotten and hardly known ewok movies he made after rotj they would both fit on one disc and should be included as a bonus too now wouldnt all these years of wait seem more worthwhile if it came with both editions of each film the original and special both presentations of wide and full screen and maybe throw in those two ewok movies aswell wouldnt that seem more worth the wait instead lucas is going to release a disapointing trilogy but if you want my advice wait dont buy this trilogy rent it and dont make lucas richer off this box set because you will be kicking yourself in a couple of years time when star wars comes out and george goes for the disc box set and you think to yourself damn i shouldnt have bought the trilogy i have i should have bought the new one with all those extras and youll feel lucas has ripped you off as its looking right now because most likly he will release the original trilogy and make money off that too then find other ways to make money there will be single editions special editions ultimate editions mega editions and probably to choose from in wide or full screens this over due and long wait for these so called greatest dvd release that has been told about is going to be the greatest rip off of all time so many fans will shut down there lightsabres take off there helmets and walk away feeling like there god has just turned there back on them to make the most money out of them he can wookies will be howling at the moon over this lucas wouldnt be around least not int he way he is known today if it wernt for the fans of star wars and he has completly disapointed all of his fans with this abomination release of one of the greatest trilogys of all time would both editions and both widescreen and full screen be asking so much to put onto the one disc for each film or flip side them would it really be so hard to give back somthing really special to the fans that made him what he is today would it really be asking for too much for george to be loyal to the fans instead of trying to drain them for every cent they have thats my opinion there are going to be thousands of disapointed star wars fans out there when this comes out if you want my advice dont buy it rent it copy it do whatever just dont give lucas any satsfaction of sitting back and seeing the signs rise as he makes money off of somthing that hasnt been treated right with dvd technoligy george has ignored the possibilitys he seems to be too wrapped up in what technology has to offer in rueining classic movies may the shwartz be with you 
i was upset that the blu ray release of episodes was taking so long when they announced a release date i was excited until i realized that they are the enhanced editions im surprised that ampas hasnt sounded off on this subject while some changes to movies are arguably minor whats to stop a director from making significant changes to a film that won an academy award for best picture a version of the film that was not even evaluated now carries their seal of approval im not saying that any changes should be forbidden but the original versions should always be available i could almost convince myself to buy this product if it wasnt for the greedo scene in the cantina i found that change to be so offensive that i dont want to spend money for a version that includes it 
yet again lucas screws with what was once perfection i deserve better than this and so does my money 
i have upgraded all my essential movies from vhs to dvd i wish i could do that with my star wars trilogy but this is not it these are the special editions and not the original far superior films i have no desire to own the star wars butchered edition movies 
ive waited ten years for the original films to be remastered i will not purchase the special editions not now not ever the special editions do not even exist to me they are an insult disney do the right thing reward the fans and bring star wars back again i will not ever purchase these films until they are released in their original pre format any previous version will do thank you p s while youre at it please remake episodes 
these latest scene changes are the final proof that george lucas has lost his mind however they are not the main reason why i just cancelled my blu ray pre order i had been excitedly counting down the days until this release but this time george lucasfilm has given the whole star wars community the middle finger by not correcting many of the problems color which plagued the release this blu ray has virtually all of the same issues as the dvd im talking about vaders bubblegum pink lightsaber the super high orange or purple explosions opposed to the more realistic white hot yelow effects these were especially noticable during the battle of yavin tantive iv shootout and the carbon freezing chamber duel they stuck out to the point to where they were almost distracting after seeing the prequels its hard enough to still view vader as that ultimate bad a villian i feared in my childhood but its now near impossible to do it when hes chasing after luke with a pink lightsaber lucasfilm has been made well aware of these issues thru complaints made by ticked off fans since the dvd launched years ago now in the last year of hyping up of this blu ray release lucasfilm has assured us star wars fans that our complaints had been heard and addressed in this release the blu ray would not have the same color and audio problems as the dvds they went back to the original negatives and spent years fixing these particular problems they manually went thru frame by frame in the problem scenes fixing and making other color corrections to bring them close again to the original theatrical versions heck starwars com displays a screenshot of lukes fixed blue lightsaber on the millenium falcon in anh boasting about how they went back and fixed these problems i have seen the blu rays myself and i can confirm this is not the case yes it is fixed for that particular frame and a few other frames but the next shot of the same scene his lightsaber shifts back to green just like in the screwed up dvd release then goes to bright white then back to a very pale blue color yes they fixed only a small portion of that scene left the rest of it untouched with the wrong color while implying that the whole thing has been corrected the lightsaber scenes in the other movies empire strikes back return of the jedi are practically untouched with the same color and timing problems that the dvds have its like lucasfilm is only willing to put in a half a effort in anything they release anymore and why not if it says star wars on the box its going to sell now for the changed scenes a new hope when r d hides in the shallow cave from the sand people there have been cgi rocks added in the new rocks now cover up half of r s body which makes him hidden better however when he leaves a few seconds later he just pulls forward and the rocks simply disappear did they just forget to alter that scene too obi wans introduction he scares the sand people away with a krayt dragon call has been redone again and now sounds like a jr high kid making funny noises in windows sound recorder when i first heard it i thought no way its someone pulling a joke its sounds so bad and is so out of place they made absolutely no effort to mix it in at all youll just have to hear it for yourselves but sadly its real unbelievable greedo still shoots first it is alot better than the dvd version empire strikes back wampas arm in fixed looks good about time return of the jedi jabbas palace has a bigger door ok new cgi alien walking around in jabbas palace as everyone sleeps poorly done and sticks out worse than a sore thumb looks like sebulba from episode i ewoks now have cgi eyelids blink and sometimes make a clicking noise when they do maybe a tribute to muppets fraggle rock darth vader now screams noooooooooooo as he picks up and throws the emperor much like the way he does at the end of episode iii now twice this ruins a great and one of my favorite scenes its bad the voice doesnt even sound like vaders and its just lazily pasted over the rest of the audio lucasfilm didnt make the effort to blend in at all what are they thinking if you really feel you need to add something like that at least attempt a decent job this has just gotten laughingly ridiculous there is no excuse this time for ignoring what the fans want and taking away more of the original magic the movies had back in the s and s besides the deleted scenes this is not a quality release ive cancelled my pre order and im done with anything new to do with star wars this includes the new upcoming d versions which will no doubt have even more stupid changes and conveniently opens the door for yet another blu ray release i have my unaltered copies on my bonus dvd and thats all i need i urge anyone who feels the same way to not fill the pockets of george lucas anymore i dont understand how they think its necessary tinker with new stupid voiceovers and ewok eyes but not fix the more obvious and distracting problems of this and the previous release all the while lucasfilm insinuated just as recently as last week that they had indeed corrected those problems that is false advertising they also claimed to have exhaustively sent this set thru levels of quality control which is either another lie or lucas has the most elite team of a kissers ever assembled ive defended the first two prequels the special editions and george lucas himself over the years but im done for the first time in years they will not be getting another dime of my money 
the first time george lucas made changes to the original episodes iiii v and vi well fine that move could be explained as fixing the flaws and faults of the movies that arguably came out ahead of their own time when the cinematic technology was not quite able to properly present his vision of an epic struggle between good and evil for the record this reviewer unlike some diehard purists liked the changes except the face off between han solo and greedo in a new hope and perhaps the musical score at the very end of return of the jedi having said all this the changes made for the dvd trilogy edition seem to have been done for the sake of making more changes not to mention making mockery of his proclamation that the special editions are the definitive vision indeed this latest whatever is analygous with people who undergo cosmetic surgeries as a matter of obsession and addiction also it is as though lord lucas is actually ashamed of having cast clive revill as the emperor in the empire strikes back and sabestian shaw as the elderly anakin skywalker in the return of the jedi and so on and so forth defenders of lord lucas might say that he made these switches for the sake of continuity between the original and prequel trilogies not to mention perfection so what these movies already lack in it anyway exhibit a while anakin has aged considerably between i and ii note the casting change from jake lloyd to whats his name padme has not aged one bit maybe she was frozen in carbonite during all that time exhibit b in ii owen lars evidently has had possession of c po for quite awhile by the time he first meets anakin in iiii though he has no clue whatsoever who what he is maybe he had all his memories from ii wiped out it is sincerely hoped that as the movies that were originally filmed in b w are now routinely available in both original and colourised versions the original trilogy would continue to be available in all three versions original special and the most recent special special editions now that would be a fantastical service to any and all who even casually care about this one of a kind space saga 
this set is only the cgi altered version of the films heaven forbid we get the original releases cant wait until we see the lucas cgi updates of citizen kane where rosebud is a cgi ewok and gone with the wind where scarlett shoots at han solo first cmon you know in a couple years lucas will shocker re release this again as a blu ray set that will include both versions dont get sucked in and just save your money for the next release which will inevitably have both versions 
the back of the box the one with darth and the red light saber on the front lists these films as the original trilogy episodes except they are not both the dvd and blue ray play the re release cgi upgraded versions not the original trilogy as released in the theaters i received these as a gift and i am going to try and return them as i already have the in my humble opinion poor cgi versions on dvd if you already have the remade versions to dont want them or dont care to have them on blu ray then do not purchase this one star because of the attempt to dupe the consumer 
instead of listening to just about everyone lucas has decided to ruin these movies even more if you buy this then you are telling him its okay for him to do this just find some sap that actually bought this and borrow the extras join the movement wait for the original unaltered movies 
well lucas must be the only director out there not wanting to make the fans happy im baffled by the fact that a decision like that comes from a man who is into the latest technology in film now forcing me and a lot of fans out there to steer away from the best possible medium right now to view these movies blu ray i cannot and will not spend money on a blu ray set of these that do not contain the unaltered versions it is against my priciple and i stand by that to make mathers worse hes about to spend time and money on a d release again in theatres omg man what you thinkin restore the originals at best possible release them on blu ray along with the other versions your vision and ill fork out the cash right now untill then ill stick to my pal versions lines non anamorphic of the unaltered dvd releases they dont look that great but they are the best out there since you get about lines extra resolution compared to the ntsc if im correct here if lucas continues to be stubborn like this he gonna get a lot of fans against him tbh the outcry is just incredible theres isnt a forum out there that is not discussing this george please man come to peace with your fans and make us all happy thank you
i grew up loving star wars and then when it was finally released on dvd i was highly disappointed because the editions were the poorly bastardized versions that mr lucas keeps putting out this edition is the same if you want a newly styled package this is the set for you otherwise boycott george lucas and his lust for money and do not buy this item wait for lucas films to remaster not redo the original original movies and put them on dvd no more revising of history 
come on george enough this ridiculous cgi nonsense is garbage stop messing with the films and give us the original theatrical releases already if you had to mess with them you could at least have done a decent job of it look at how realistic the lord of the rings films looked now thats how you do effects but if youre going to do the crappy cgi stuff dont bother doing anything at all i just cant understand why it is so hard to just give the fans what they want stop assuming what fans want and insisting on forcing this crap down their throats and give them what they are actually asking for 
i was going to pre order but not now why does lucas continue to screw with us just give us what we want and youll sell tons im not interested in your re hashed versions i want the ones i saw in the theater 
not the original trilogy in any sense of those words these are the bastardized versions that lucas unleashed about years ago id happily buy the originals that i enjoyed as a young man but not this nasty revisionist dreck 
this is a note to my friends and family do not buy this for me as a gift its not what i want its not the original films its the special addition the packaging should state bespin now with more windows 
pretty simple really i will not buy another molested version of this classic sci fi adventure not much use in restating what everyone here has been saying i just wanted to add my voice to its song give us the original cuts on blu ray or you will never see another cent of my cold hard earned cash han shot first
i bet that eventually lucas will get so greedy as to release a version with the movies as they should be when this happens people will end up paying for yet another set if you buy this be prepared for a messed up movie and to end up paying for it again in a couple years 
the more you mess with something the uglier it gets just like michael jacksons face this gets more and more ugly each time george tinkers with his movies all the one star ratings in the world wont change anything we will never get the originals i knew that when the dvds first came out and bought them anyway as for bluray i will pass on this there was a time i wanted the bluray for my collection suddenly i am not interested anymore thanks for giving me great childhood memories and destroying them in my adult life i am dissapointed and finished 
i was actually going to buy a blue ray player and an hd tv to go with the purchase of the new original star wars blue ray discs but im so glad i didnt buy this blue ray set what a sham and a shame he didnt include the actual originals i cant take anymore cgi my cartoon watching days are over i cant stand watching computerized images and anything fake anymore i managed to save a lot of money from reading these reviews thanks everyone i think ill wait until he remasters the originals on blue ray and leaves them as they were its too bad he doesnt listen to his fans anymore 
like another reviewer my previous review was removed for reasons that will remain a mystery to me i guess because i dont agree that this will be the best trilogy released on dvd or because i will not spend a red cent on this dvd but here goes i happen to like the trilogy as it originally was and i am not old enough to be a part of the old generation the add ons will incorporate the abyssmal prequels with the old star war movies incorporating in particular a younger anakin wraith at the end of return of the jedi to avoid being censored again i will say that this is a great fantastic idea this isnt a personal issue but alot reviewers seem to be abusing the privledge of writing a review as means of firewalling so i want to be different and go ahead and say that i think george lucas can do what he wants to his films i as a consumer will have the right not to be taken in by it i think it wouldve been nice to get a dvd of the original unedited version along with the edited version of the trilogy then it wouldve made both parties revisionists and old schoolers happy it wouldve made lucas more moolah megabucks but he didnt so i can live with that i can live with not spending any money on this product so for those people looking for the unedited versions of the original starwars trilogy they are not included in the dvd set consider this before purchasing so you will not be disappointed 
not until the original theatrical editions are restored and released will i spend another dollar on star wars films if viewers want these films please purchase them but for the rest of us we will continue to wait 
the star wars trilogy is one of the most amazing picture films in the history of cinema id like to see them in their theatrical releases with state of the art picture and sound quality no laserdisc masters i want to see george lucas undo what he did yes correct the big error he made to his films with a large eraser these films were treated poorly over the years starting with s special editions and the dvd release they do not need tweaking why fix something that so many fans love im not against the changes but i hate not having a choice i want the choice to choose which version i want to see im not interested in upgrading star wars until these versions see the light thats just my two cents 
like others here i was befuddled when i originally saw this disc set at my local store and quickly snatched it up looking it over for a glimpse that my prayers have been answered and lucas released a remastered version of the original films from my childhood including the original ewok song ending to ep vi believing that the use of the original artwork for the discs box and no mention of the special editions on the box i bought a copy happy that i had in fact just missed this release due to my busy work schedule leading up to the holidays but an hour later i was ready to call lucasfilm and raise hell with their deceptive marketing practices do not buy this set if you want this set pay a bit more and get the bonus disc lucas must be made to understand that the fans want the original classic films on dvd not some repackaged gimmick to pry more money from his fans 
let me start out by saying this i am not a big star wars fan i view the original trilogy as a fun marginally entertaining adventure story let us not speak of the new trilogy this review is going to be centered around the remastering and the remastering only weve all seen star wars george lucas may not be the egomaniacal fascist the pursits who revile his changes insinuate but hes still ruining three great movies for a quick buck george lucas claims that he didnt have enough money to adequately articulate his original vision vision rofflecopter truth is most of the alterations besides the boatloads of cgi are superficial and are plot oriented for example when han choppily avoids greedos laser and fires back you didnt have enough money to fund that asinine exchange lucas sure besides ruining hans character and further sugarcoating the movies in sickeningly sweet censorship youre also insulting my intelligence lets not mention the occasional dubbed over voices besides those tepid unnecessary changes theres alot of gci alot little cgi creatures running around doesnt make scenes seem more lively it seems lucas has no sense of imagination out of place cgi raccoon monsters only accentuate the archaic nature of any special effect that wasnt tampered with it seems cheap and plastic just like the star wars universe as of late alot of cgi was used to add sophomoric childish humor cementing these films that could once capture the imaginations of all ages as mere childrens movies changing some movies is one thing dulling the publics perception of art is another george lucas you are no longer relevant if anyone was grinding their teeth while skimming through this miniscule review feel free to lynch me with no votes each click is a personal bombardment to my self esteem and worth of therapy thus says the pellington
ive been saying forever that george lucas strategy is simple keep updating the original star wars movies and p ss off the fans who keep buying them over and over eventually he will release the original special editions again because the fans will buy them again booya he just released them and will make another cool couple million i havent bought a single star wars dvd still watching the old vhs dont worry the original originals will come soon george lucas taking advantage of the fans for every penny they have what an angel from the grapevine these releases are coming soon too the complete trilogy d hd blue ray special editions only individual movies d special editions complete trilogy special features and interviews complete trilogy updated scenes and new d scenes complete trilogy x original trilogy in hd and d sequencing editions the special edition hd trilogy x with bonus features duh and guess what the fans will buy them again and again and again and again and you know im right 
i saw the dvd special edition and it was terrible at this point i wouldnt want the bluray special edition even if it were free since it would be a painful reminder of what could have been i continue to hope that some day these movies can be released on bluray as the original movies 
like some others saw the cover art on this box set in a store saw no mention anywhere of revised editions and thinking hoping rather a new hope lol that lucas had finally come to his senses about releasing the original films bought what turned out to be nothing more than a lame re packaging of the last boxset which i might add i thought was a rather shoddy product in itself as aside from the outrageous additions had some rather sloppy editing effects nastier cheap looking jabba rubber necked slow on the trigger han and black squares around some of the ships to mention a few not to mention a rather cheap box i knew something was up when i first picked up that box and it practically half collapsed in my hand fortunately i never bought that first set just conveniently rented it from the library and after reading the reviews here on amazon before opening the packaging of this latest bit of nonsense promptly returned it for a full refund sorry george no cigar you want a little more of my money release the original films on dvd and ill gladly hand some over not til then 
millions of fans around the world adored his films bought the toys made him millions perhaps billions of dollars and in return he takes the original films butchers them with cgi and scene alterations then procalims he will never rlease the original films because to him these are the originals what an ass the se revisions are horrible in a new hope greedo shoots first making han look like a pacifist he was supposed to be a scoundrel who slowly transitions into a good guy we see jabba in a pointless conversation ruining the suspense and tension throughout the films originally there was a sense of dread caused by jabba who was he what did he look like you never saw him until the last film but now he shows up in the first film like some skinny weakling han steps on his tail and he does nothing the jabba in the third movie would have thrown him to the rancor in empire when luke jumps into the chasm he screams like a little baby ruining the powerful moment in which he was supposed to courageously jump into the chasm rather than join the dark side the scream only makes sense if he were pushed but he chose to jump this was supposed to be the scene where luke becomes mature a change in character from when he was a teen on tatooine ruined in return of the jedi we get a horrible musical scene with a thing that looks like the honeycomb guy singing unwatchable also boba fetts death is put on the level of a fart joke with lucas adding a burp in after he is swallowed by the sarlaac there would be no complaints if he released both and gave the fans a choice which they want to buy but no its his way or nothing imagine if this happened with every old film dirty harry could have some cgi explosions they could update al pacinos hair in scarface dub dialogue into silent films where would it end lucas is a one trick pony who got lucky with an idea and now his ego is ruining the franchise that was one the most powerful on the planet buy the lotr trilogy instead if you dont have it or look for some original trilogy bootlegs dont give any more money to that bloated ass lucas lucas has been known to be full of crap so perhaps he will release the originals in a few years to rack up on some more money go to originaltrilogy com and sign the petition 
i am tired of all things related to star wars i bought the vhs special edition in and the changes that lucas made were really disappointing from what i read in some of these reviews lucas has done it again and this version has even more unnecessary revisions all i want is the original movie remastered and restored to its original state 
it seems that the power of george is far reaching and quite merciless like the crushing fist of the empire i wont go into great detail but it seems that one of my posts has been removed due to a policy about conflicting material i e i submitted a post thinly disguised as st george himself i can only assume that a lucas arts crony saw my post and leaned on amazon to remove it the post was funny and mostly harmless when i say harmless i mean it was acerbic and it mocked georges credibility as a visionary as well as a human being but the fact that i happen to think george a has lost his touch b never had it c is a power hungry money grubbing sociopathic megalomanical madman ord all the above doesnt give them the right to censor my opinion about his tactics and or his films thats what writing reviews are supposed to be all about sharing opinions so everyone can make an informed decision i want to end this by saying anyone that grew up with these films actually saw them in the theaters and can stand by his new abominations has been sadly misguided i can only hope that after watching these new films some of you will say that put expletive here was right and the truth will be revealed maybe one day george will have his own truth revealed to him being inspired by the works of joseph campbell surely one day he will be able to understand the mythology that has been formulated around his original creations and instead of constantly trying to pervert or enhance the original vision maybe one day he will come to respect the beauty and innocence of this simple yet complex tale may the force be with all of you 
too bad that you have to give one star i would love to give this release zero stars theres no way im going to buy the so called special editions of these movies i could live with a set that included both the original and the bastardized versions but if lucas insists that the ses are the only versions that will be released ill have take very good care of my vhs copies of the original trilogy it looks like they are going to be the only copies of these movies that ill ever own 
what about the scene in tesb after the sabre battle where luke declines vaders offer to um join him for some familial dark side ruling and falls from his perch into the depths of cloud city as i recall from the original version luke made not a whimper making it a memorable act of defiance sadly the special edition edits in an unintentionally hilarious scream rendering luke into what sounds like a chug a lug taking his first bungee jump just as greedo shoots first robs han solos character of valuable shading the scream robs luke of his heroic grandeur kiddies dont seem to understand the value of this the value of strong characterizations and dramatic subtext preferring instead to ramble on about the pretty but meaningless add on visuals and sfx more opium for the gaming generation consider these special editions alongside the useless remakes of other important s films likewise robbed of their mature underpinnings and societal context for the continued ogling of the increasingly unrelatable and uninspired movie going public 
raise your hand if you remember how long it took for the star wars trilogy any version at all to become available on dvd for nearly two decades star wars was the movie with which to showcase high end home theater systems any store that was selling big screen tvs and surround sound receivers back when both were prohibitively expensive for the average household was guaranteed to have a copy of star wars on hand to show off the hardware then dvds came out and blew vhs and laserdiscs out of the water and long after dvds had firmly been established as the video format of choice george lucas still waited years to release any version of star wars even the versions he tampered with on dvd it seemed ridiculous that these movies which were so ahead of their time that they were still being used as the litmus test of home theater technology years later were only available in an inferior and obsolete format that was rapidly losing market share and now hes doing it again giant tvs and high definition video are rapidly becoming the norm judging by george lucass unprecedented use of spare no expense digital movie magic its clear hes no purist or technophobe so whats the hold up why must we again wait for what was once the greatest home theater showpiece to play catch up with the mainstream technology the entire star wars saga should have been one of the first things released on blu ray not the last though id still hold out for a remastered but otherwise un tampered with version of the original trilogy i dont much care for the edited versions or the new trilogy 
lucas must have some kind of mental disorder star wars was nominated for best picture the three movies earned gigantic sums of money a whole generation loves the movies beyond words in the special editions were a lot of fun to see on the big screen i like so many others was thrilled to see the new additions and surprises i didnt realize then that those editions marked the end of star wars in its original form now the special editions have become even more special with as many have documented already lots of additional surprises ive had enough putting hayden christensen in the end of return of the jedi really takes the cake bottom line whether you think the new movies phantom and clones suck or not they do i dont want to see cameo appearances by the new cast especially in what was one of the most emotionally satisfying scenes in the trilogy luke see the spirits of yoda obi wan and his father i have resigned myself never to give lucas another nickel 
this is the stupid re release version that ruined star wars the originals should be released on blu ray too there was no reason to alter a masterpiece 
future generations will now be unable to see the original versions the changes made for these versions are not for the better fx in the famous scene in the bar greedo gets the first shot against han solo and misses at a distance of one yard so that han solo political correctly doesnt shoot before being shot at himself george lucas must have lost his marbels changing a great scene like that 
i like the original trilogy of star wars just as much as the next person perhaps even moreso these movies were classics in film history and will never lose their status as such star wars came along and changed the way movies were made from then on for the better definitely new directors and writers arent afraid to make fantasy or sci fi movies anymore we have a lot to owe to the original trilogy but do we have a lot to owe to the dvds a new hope lucas goes on to further change this one since he made the first real changes back in the special editions of not only is mos eisley crowded but we get new aliens in the cantena sure the graphics and cgi are good but they subtract from the actual storyline one instance of this is jabba the hutt visiting han solo by the millenium falcon the cgi on this version of jabba is just terrible to say the least he looks like an half finished piece of computer work that a cgi student did in college or something not only does he not look real but he looks downright pathetic remarkably he is a step down from the cgi of in this scene han solo proceeds to step on jabbas tail there are technical reasons for this having to do with a jabba stand in being originally a human but it totally confuses the story and characters if jabba is such a feared and exhalted being how could han get away with stepping on his tail and showing blatant disrespect and disregard for his authority jabba comes across as very unscary now thanks to the dvd and special editions the empire strikes back the change of adding in the snow monster happened back in it wasnt a plausible and useful addition to the movie instead of being elusive and more scary we get to see the snow monster now i have to admit that some of the shots of cloud city were interesting and perhaps forgiveable but what about the original unedited versions were they so bad did they subtract from the story no not showing all of cloud city helped the movie be more mysterious but now the city is layed bare like a nudist woman the return of the jedi this is the weaker movie of the original trilogy in my opinion but that is for another time and place to discuss its actual weaker points with the exception of the abomination that was jabbas palace the cgi changes were almost non existant to the naked eye right to about the time at the end when the spirits of the jedi are standing and watching the celebration of the ewoks notice anything of course you noticed hayden christensen has replaced sebastian shaw why i dont know george claims continuity but if he really cared about continuity he would have made the prequel trilogy better wouldnt he it is a cop out and disgrace this is unforgivable in my opinion there are some bonus features on this dvd but they hardly make up for the bastadization of the actual movies such as commentary sub par commentary by sound effects artists george lucas and the director of esb also there is a documentary called empire of dreams that is indeed worth watching if you fail to understand the point of view that older fans of the original trilogy have of star wars and its legacy do i suggest buying this dvd no would it be a good edition to your collection of ridiculous and cop out editions of classic movies yes 
a few days ago the overall rating for this was stars there have been nothing but one star reviews since then now all of a sudden its up to and a half even though of the reviews are one star due to lucas stubbornness looks like lucas goons are at it again 
it is very simple george you first released star wars in that release made you a billion dollars then and later for the empire strikes back and return of the jedi perhaps you loathe them now perhaps you wake up late at night screaming incoherently drenched in sweat and tortured over the hell you created years ago well too bad suck it up you are a billionaire thanks to moviegoers that saw your movies between and not and i am going to be the one to say it you owe us the original theatrical versions why because those are the ones that gave you your fortune that we fell in love with growing up the ones we paid for in and so yes george you imbecile you owe us those versions anything else is a stab in the back and an insult to every moviegoer that made you a billionaire period over and out 
i have to say i hate this version of the trilogy i remember seeing the original version as a kid and i loved it it was such an amazing experience there was really nothing like it at the time and the story pulled me in to such an extent that i saw the movie s multiple times and loved them each and every time it was not only my experience of the movie but that of my family and my friends as well it was a shared social experience to see the original version of the story so what that the special effects werent perfect my imagination filled in details that werent specifically shown on the screen and as many times as i saw that story like many kids i want to see that version of the story i dont want to see george lucass oooo i really wish i could have done this when i made this movie it would have been so much cooler if i really hate george lucas for mucking up a social icon i want to see the story that i experienced and loved as a kid not the version that george lucas felt compelled to tweak i refuse to buy this version of the movie if george ever decides to put out the original non special edition version of this movie i will buy it in a heartbeat until then ill have to live with the really old and bad vhs copy that i bought as soon as the trilogy was released onto vhs originally 
if you have any love for the original star wars trilogy you will not buy this set lucas knows that even if it sucks we will pay for anything that has the name star wars written on it by saying well its the lame o special edition but its better than nothing and shelling out hard earned money for this set youre just playing into his hands we need to rise up against lucas he has gone to the dark side send a message that he had no right to change our movie just because he wasnt satisfied with it this trilogy is bigger than him and its bigger than all of us so go forth and protest and may the force be with you ps i actually give it zero stars but that wasnt an option 
lucas can do whatever he wants with his movies and he has having said that this is not the original trilogy as others have said this version has new deleted modified scenes maybe a better title would be the modern original trilogy or variations on the original trilogy 
i thought id be a bit more fair than some other reviewers who arent happy about what lucas did to these movies i have a friend who recently bought this trilogy watched only once from another friend for three per movie grand total of nine dollars now i dont think my friend got an unfair price although i feel its a bit on the high side to be paying for butchered classics if i were to buy this trilogy six dollars two per movie sounds more reasonable to me despite the fact that lucas destroyed a legacy and toyed with the childhood dreams of many of us if he decides to drop the price to six bucks for the whole thing ill consider buying it after all dvds can make attractive drink coasters 
i love star wars not star wars episode iv a new hope but just star wars and the empire strikes back is even better this is an awesome movie trilogy as we all know it is great to have it on dvd but i like most other fans it would seem do not like the intrusive nature of some of the digitally rendered add ons in these movies the most infamous of which is the insertion of a young hayden christensen to take the place of anakins ghost you know from back when anakin skywalker was a member of nsync its more than a little disconcerting george lucas has definitely gone off the deep end he keeps blabbering on and on about how now that he has the technology he is just remaking these movies into what he wanted them to be before the technology existed yadda yadda yadda whatever personally i think he is full of crap myself but maybe thats just me i seriously doubt that when george lucas was making star wars he was thinking geez you know this han solo guy is really too much of a bad a i think i would rather have greedo shoot first but i just dont have the technology to make that look realistic or much as i would like to show anakins ghost being a hot young hunk i dont have the technology to do that so i think ill use this old geezer instead get real the simple truth is that old georgie just cant stop messing with his movies hes like a person addicted to plastic surgery he keeps seeing flaws where there are none he doesnt know when to leave well enough alone and the result is something that really tees off at least probably more of his fans and thats something else that really rankles lucas hypocrisy i have heard him repeatedly state that he just makes movies for the fans that he just wants to make fun movies that people like but simply put thats a lie he doesnt listen to his fans he doesnt give us what we want he simply does not care and why should he after all theyre his movies and he is making them the way he wants them to be right well thats fine i dont have a problem with that but if he is serious about pleasing the fans why doesnt he give the fans what he wants hes a hypocrite but we wouldnt even have star wars without george lucas the fanboys say sure thats true but that doesnt mean that i dont have the right to still feel irked when he jerks the movies i remember out from under me but theyre his movies and he has the right to make them however he wants the fanboys say repeatedly again i have no problem with that but what people really mean when they tell you that is you just need to shut up im sorry but i wont shut up i wont shut up until george lucas gives his real fans what they want maybe theyll release the real movies on dvd someday years from now after lucas has been dead for a while that might be the only way we will ever get it but knowing him hell probably stick it in his will that no one will ever mess with my movies sure im hanging on to my old vhs tapes myself at least he cant take those away from me yet 
star wars it really has tested my patience over the years the god awful prequels for one although ep was alright and of course proof positive that george lucas beard had taken over his brain the special edition cuts dont shrug your shoulders and go ah its only minor little cuts it doesnt really matter yes it does it matters because george lucas is not giving you the movies that you want george lucas is telling you the consumer what to buy even though every star wars fan wants the movie they grew up with the living beard wants to shove his inferior and make no mistake about it they are vastly inferior versions down your throat its the sign of an ego trip like no other and you should not have anything to do with it but what do you do if you want the movies simple ebay theyre some pretty good bootleg sets going around with all the extras and the laser disc so still excellent picture quality original versions of the movies you want please note i hate piracy with a burning passion but this is the only way to get the real star wars and give lucas the finger while youre at it star wars quite simply one of the best things ever but do not buy this boxset the curmudgeon hates you yahoo co uk
i recently purchased a used laserdisc player and all three original star wars films in their original theatrical versions why because of this monstrosity even the extras are dissapointing i rented them off of netflix since the bulk is a minute mtv style documentary about minutes of which is actually interesting really im a die hard star wars fan but this wont ever be on my shelf pick up lucas thx for an example of how an update should be done then again lucas should learn to listen to his fans more or just stop watching his own films at the very least he could have put the original versions on here in addition to the newer versions 
good movies but it is the digitally remastered version by george lucas where he screwed up the ending of episode by adding the younger version of anakin skywalker that ruined the entire movie 
im going to keep my review short what george lucas has done to these original films is shameful for me its like claude monet going back to one of his original innovative beautiful paintings and adding is some junk that shouldnt be there another analogy i like to use is david gilmour guitarist from pink floyd going back to wish you were here and adding in guitar parts that never existed in the original recording the fact that lucas would even allow cgi to be inserted into the original films is completely moronic and uncalled for what hes done is hes thrown all of the hard work the production staff costume designers set designers etc have done down the toilet i cant imagine what these people who worked on these films thought of their work after seeing these butchered versions lucas should have learned his lesson by now you dont tamper with the movies that made your name and brought you millions of dollars its as simple as that lucas if you have any shred of sympathy in your body then release the original theatrical versions of these films nobody cares what you think of the films now or what direction you think they should go in leave your art alone 
i loved star wars and would love to see it on my hi def plasma in all its glory it is not to be found on these disks screw george lucas for changing a wonderful film and then burying the original i will not buy this product or any other star wars offering unti the original film is made available i do not mind if the original film stock is restored or the sound is tweeked for modern home theater but for gods sake dont change the plot han shot first han shot first han shot first 
dear george lucas i wanted this blu ray set more than anything hi def original trilogy sign me up but no beyond greedo shooting first beyond crappy cg jabba beyond abysmal rotj musical number beyond three mediocre to awful prequels beyond insertion of hayden christiansen beyond the solar ring death star explosions you added crap that looks and sounds like a year olds youtube fan edit george to quote an old friend of yours george you can type this s but you sure as hell cant say it harrison ford was referring to your script but the same definitely goes for your newest additions i wish you liked the original films as much as i do or did anyway they didnt need this kind of facelift people love them for the stories the characters the action the comedy han solo the badass luke the noble knight lando the token character but still coolest man in the galaxy the powerful emotionally charged lightsaber battles the space wars this is what we love and we loved it since the beginning but you obviously hate the originals why else would you inject these juvenile changes we were already disheartened by the enhancements in then in for the dvds now youve lost me as a fan i wouldnt have minded the deleted scenes and will probably watch them and them alone at some point but you did a disservice not just to fans but to the films that made you who you are most people would have respected that i will not buy this set and have cancelled my preorder i will either have to pirate the original original somehow or simply let the films remain untarnished in my memories goodbye star wars it was good while it lasted 
first of all i am a huge star wars fan but watching the re released trilogy left me feeling sick to my stomach it is my firm belief that george lucas has become completely senile and im not referring to that complete debacle known as the phantom menace he has ruined the original three too first of all there is no redeemable features from the new versions the new scenes look completely out of place with the antiquated effects of the original versions sure some of the old effects were cheesy like lukes speeder but at least the gave the movie continuity seeing old and new affects insults me one of my favorite parts of the first one was the scene with greedo and han they ruined it then they insert this ridiculous scene with jaba into the first one jaba looks entirely two dimensional especially if you look closely jabas entire mass fits between hans arm and the front of his torso i agree to that the scene with luke and his old buddy was completely out of place too and only hurts the film a major problem i also have with all three quot enhanced quot versions is the lasers and lightsabers they look like mikenike candies theyre more neon and brighter now but still look like they just colored over the original film the old lasers werent great but they didnt look like someone colored over them with a magic marker if they wanted to improve the original they should have fixed mistakes like when you can tell obi wans lightsaber is just a wire and it sizzles next is the esb this was probably the least offensive of the se versions a new scene with the snow monster and some scenes from the cloud city that again seem completely out of place and disrupt the continuity of the movie then we come to the return of the jedi which made me furious this enhanced version is completely worthless they add this really really lame digitized scene to the part where the band is playing in jabas throne room the creatures all look ridiculous and very poorly done especially the furry creature they added which basically just embarrassed me it looks like a cross between a cartoon and fraggle rock and that in a room next to darkness and guys like bobafet need i say more i will the worse part of this is i actually liked the old song by jabas band this one is terrible then there is a new scene with the sarlacc pit monster where they actually made it so a head would come out of the pit totally ruined the seen monster looks sooo cheesy and ruins the mystery of quot what is this thing quot all it is is this thing that looks like a cross between a worm from quot tremors quot and the venus flytrap from that movie with rick moranis everything is ok from here until the very ending which they have completely changed gone is the scenes with the ewoks and now is scenes from coruscant and the cloud city of people dancing which again are completely out of place and the worse part the song the old one was kind of catchy and uplifting now its just some stupid anthem with a flute that sounds worthy of celine dion my final word on the se trilogy dont buy it go to a garage sale and buy the originals rent them copy them tape them off of usa if you have to 
this isnt what i was expecting this isnt the star wars i kept long memories of i dont like the changes or any of the cgi why tamper with a piece of art to me star wars was fine as it was back in this isnt what i wanted im just making this short i dont want to make a big deal but i mean come on whats next maybe years from now lucas is going to make changes again to episode iv what could possible he do to make it wrong how about a scene in which han and luke are walking out of the millenium falcon and encounter that unfunny stupid clown of jar jar sheesh lucas gone mad someone stop him 
just finished viewing the sneak of episode and when we saw hayden christensen decked out in darth vaders costume the room erupted in laughter has there ever been an actor so wantonly and grossly miscast there is absolutely no menace no snarl no underlying tones of darkness in the posture eyes face or voice of hayden christensen no edge at all lucas how could you send a boy to do a mans job oh wait thats right youre the same genius responsible for destroying a legacy your poor casting choices should not and do not come as any surprise i cannot wait until episode opens in theaters the feelings of awe and wonderment that should have been will now be replaced with howls of derisive scornful laughter cant blame hayden though his participation in these films has locked in his meal ticket for the rest of his life if he or ewan macgregor for that matter had any integrity they would have bowed their heads in shame and refused to cooperate in the ineptitude that has become george lucas whimsy what an utterly tragic way to end it really the best thing one can do is pretend the prequels were never made at best after watching the horror that is phantom menace attack of the clones and probably sith you can tell yourself that the storytelling does get better but even then youll have to search and scrap to find the real and the true star wars the original films are what have endured it is the originals that have made lucas rich to deny the countless millions of fans whats true and dear is an out and out travesty and disgrace 
why george lucas why why would you do this your new release is insulting just leave the films alone the most insulting part is the editing of the most climatic scene of the trilogy where luke removes darths helmet lo and behold george clown edited out shaw and stuck hayden in i wanted to smash the hell out of the tv george lucas should not be allowed to touch his original masterpieces the dvds went immeditaly into the basement never to be touched again 
memo to george lucas i am not buying any more of your movies until you give us the remastered films as they were originally han shoots first hayden christiansens ghost does not appear at the end of rotj the original nub nub ewok music is put back into the film and the original jabbas palace band music is restored etc etc get the picture you can do it george and dont tell us that the original negatives for these films no longer exist because i dont believe you if you think you are going to keep me buying and rebuying and rebuying the same product over and over and over again then think again because im not coming along for the ride i repeat as soon as you release the original and versions of the films as they were originally and they must be remastered not grainy laserdisc transfers then and only then can you have any more of my money just give the fans what they want is that too much to ask 
i saw this movie in a theatre and my sense was that the audience was sort of interested in the plot but probably knew little about what iran meant some years ago etc the film does not help it talks and talks and talks and ben aflick without the help of george clooney and others would never have made it through this pseudo pbs thing notice at the academy awards and golden globe awards how nervous and incoherent aflick was with clooney whom he forgot to acknowledge at both events clooney said later that the films award belonged to many other people i think aflick knew that the award for best picture at the academy awards was from left field way left and he felt the embarassment the lack of deservedness he acted like a loser even with the clooney guidance the film is very bad and it is a shame that it received any awards at all the competion was way above this tv nex flick avoid see the life of pi 
i probably would have never watched this movie if it had not won the oscar for best picture since for me les miserables was by far the most deserving movie even lincoln would have been more deserving so i downloaded this movie via emule thats right i wasnt going to give up any real money to watch this fraud of a movie i just wanted to see what the hoopla was all about and i do believe in supporting movies that i really like often buying all the dvd blu ray high definition etc versions of the movies that i truly love les mis is going to get my money the biggest strike against argo is that it is a completely false re write of the real history of what happened yes hollywood does that and it is called artistic license but the clear cut self congratulatory effort to hugely inflate the role of hollywood in the story while downplaying the role of the canadians and inserting false slams against some of our allies made this movie unworthy to even be considered as a best picture candidate entertainment value meh just another caper movie not one of my favorite kinds of movies again unworthy of a best picture nomination ok so maybe this movie doesnt deserve a one star rating just on its merits as a mildly interesting caper movie with a terrible distortion of history but it deserves its one star for having campaigned to get an oscar for best picture it is simply beyond my understanding why hollywood keeps doing this all it does is totally discredit the oscar award as a legitimate award with any meaning a previous example of the oscar going to an undeserving picture was when shakespeare in love won best picture over saving private ryan for best picture in now i did sort of like shakespeare in love but seriously saving private ryan will go down in history as a landmark war movie one of the best of all time whereas nobody will remember the lightweight fluff of shakespeare in love a worse fate awaits argo an utterly forgettable caper movie filled with badly re written history winning the oscar for best picture only because of the internal politicking of the academy and its propensity for self congratulation 
im sorry i watched this movie twice because i thought i had missed something whether it was factual or as close to the truth as it could get was not an issue for me poetic license this movie for me was painfully slow i couldnt wait for it to be over i wanted to see it because it won best picture going to check to see what it was up against 
the story is supposed to be true but it isnt it didnt happen like the movie portrays which would be ok if the exaggerated movie was more entertaining for it but the movie was choppy boring you never had any character development so you really didnt care whether or not the characters ever got out and the interesting part where they were actually making their escape took place in just a few minutes not recommended cannot understand how it won any awards 
so once upon a time ben affleck along with matt damon won an oscar for best original screenplay for good will hunting that was light years ago now afflecks abysmally terrible movie argo has won the oscar for best picture good will hunting was a decent movie i guess but argo is the most boring misleading inaccurate piece of lame leftist propaganda ever to come down the pike how it ever beat out any of the other movies in the best picture category is beyond me somebody with deep pockets must have purchased that gold statuette theres no other way to explain it affleck and his other liberal left wing pal george clooney were producers of this clunker made worse by afflecks catatonic acting i am old enough to remember the actual events depicted in the film and even as fiction this movie bites nowhere near what really happened which would be fine except that affleck himself tried to use its historical basis as some sort of selling point even worse were afflecks comments about this film as quoted in the hollywood reporter and its the same regime it was khomeni now its khamenei theres still this islamist this stalinist regime and that makes me sad that makes me feel like yeah we had this wonderful thing that happened in our movie where america really did something right but that we havent figured out how to navigate our relationship with countries in the middle east dear mr affleck you are just an actor you are not a statesman or an ambassador or a politician or a world leader who really gives a rip what you perceive to be our problems in the middle east bottom line this movie is rotten film in and of itself its even worse as a political statement which affleck clearly intended it to be nauseating dont waste one cent of your money or one second of your time on this trash
