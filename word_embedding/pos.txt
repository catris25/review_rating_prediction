good action and the ultra hot jennifer lawrence so the ingredients are all there a good portion of this movie was shot near where i live and some of it shot within walking distance of my home out in the middle of nowhere in the nc mountains most of extras are from here and it was fun to see people i know in the final cut of the movie 
i enjoyed this movie yes ive read the books people will always be upset because things are always missing from the story when you take a book and transfer it to film i thought it was done well other people didnt understand the concept this is a trilogy youre not supposed to learn everything in the first book everything will come together and there will be more understanding overall it was a great representation of the book in my opinion 
great movie kept my interest all the way through wasnt aware if story line sine i didnt read the book 
worth the watch moved well and was a surprisingly adult for a childrens movie it may not be suitable for middle school or younger children 
the hunger games directed by gary ross seabiscuit is a real witches brew of many genre i see alice in wonderland caricatures like stanley tuccis over the top flaming flamboyant bouffant blue haired talk show host caesar flickerman and elizabeth banks as the apply named comic book fashionesta effie trinket then we have a pinch of lord of the rings grandeur a dash of ruthless lord of the flies child thrown for cinematic atmosphere a touch of harry potter fantasy and a big dose of tvs survivor reality show all of this bubbled up in one big cauldron of non stop adventure our heroine attractive young capable year old katniss everdeen played by jennifer lawrence sets out early one misty morning crossing secretly into the forbidden zone to hunt armed only with her trusty bow and arrows she stalks and takes aim at an innocent doe with deer eyes i cant bear it but out of nowhere who should appear but her tall dark prince charmer neighbor gale hawthorne played by hunky liam hemsworth wise beyond his years he proceeds to demonstrate to her how she might put to better use her skills as an effective archer in the future hint hint the forest is lush green and serene paralleled to the highly advanced metropolis in which the capitol is located this in brutal contrast to the barren wasteland of panem city where katniss is forced to live with her mother and younger sister while we are slowly being introduced into this sterile post apocalyptic environment there is an ever present underlying ominous pale looming over the town folk soon enough we discover that they are preparing for an inevitable event everyone will be summoned to the capitol square where each year one boy and one girl will be selected as tribute from each of districts a pair will be chosen through a lottery to participate in what amounts to a death match the repeating anthem being may all the luck be in your favor the event akin to the superbowl will be viewed on big screen monitors for the enjoyment of all to see voila the hunger games are born the rest of the principals in this entertaining cast o heroes victims and villains consists of josh hutcherson as peeta mellark the unlikely boy tribute from district katniss young sister is originally picked but katniss herself will later volunteer as tribute sparing her sister rounding out the cast are mentor to our two tributes haymitch abernathy played craftily by woody harrelson a semi unrecognizable lenny kravitz as cinna aka groom and stylist to the stars wes bentley as the inept minion seneca crane to the supreme leader of the capitol gang president snow played by donald sutherland who is always a joy i never expected the clever twists and turns the way the story skillfully unfolds the stunning visuals and the inspiring soundtrack although i felt it lacking in some strange inexplicable way it was a surprisingly well crafted pg syfy ish romp in the woods from the starting countdown all the way to the winners circle enjoy 
this excellent film shows how character can endure no matter the level of corruption the state went too far in controlling people though 
five star all the way grandkids want this for chhristmas gift from santa and i want to give them what they want thank you santa and amazon
found the first dvd of the series follows the book very closely i cant wait for the next one to come out 
at hours and minutes long diehard fans will still wonder why their favorite scenes from the book were cut where is the bread from district where is prims goat we would love to see a hour directors cut we have seen this movie times it is by far the most times i have ever watched a movie with my kids and i enjoyed each and every viewing the subtleties of the film become clearer with repeat viewings the attention to detail is extraordinary if you do not read the book first there is much that you will miss youll still have a positive viewing experience to be sure but there is a certain shorthand that the movie employs that only avid readers of the series will get why does katniss not speak to peeta on the train why is her relationship with her mother so strained why does katniss kiss peeta reading the books first will give you insights that a non reader wont even know they missed the movie is a tour de force suzanne collins who had a hand in writing the script has accomplished the near impossible she has used violence to demonstrate the banality of violence without ever once glorifying the violence not once when a tribute dies do you cheer his or her demise we do not even root for our heroine katniss to win we simply see the tributes for what they all are pawns in the sick twisted game that the capitol forces upon them even when the tributes themselves do not realize that they are pawns we do donald sutherland asked for the role of president snow because he considered the message of this film to be just that important to the young people in america today snows part is very small in this film i agree you should encourage your young teen to read the books and watch the film but i wouldnt recommend either for the pre teen crowd 
this movie was very good though the thought was frightening as well just thinking that something like that could occur here in the usa is unsettling 
originally published in suzanne collins novel the hunger games became wildly popular as did its two sequels luckily for movie goers the film adaptation was not treated as a potboiler quickie and we are treated with a fantastical and well made adventure rather than a loud dumb and forgettable blockbuster for those unfamiliar with the books the story follows a place called panem which is a hellish empire in the future of what is now the u s a where the patrician oligarchs in the wealthy city of capitol live in fancy and lavish lifestyles and the masses in the twelve districts live in squalor this dictatorship features an annual ritual of sacrifice in which twenty four tributes teenagers volun told by a lottery system compete in a sadistic competition called the hunger games a gladiator styled battle royale which is treated like the olympics by the media and capitol residents despite its brutal nature one year a woman named katniss everdeen jennifer lawrence in the appalachian and poorest district district finds herself shipped off to the capitol to prepare for competition in the hunger games along with fellow denizen peeta mellark josh hutcherson they meet the eccentrically dressed escort effie trinket elizabeth banks drunken mentor haymitch abernathy woody harrelson and sympathetic stylist cinna lenny kravitz this trio helps them and the other tributes prepare for the mandatory pageantry and talk shows they must participate in before the hunger games begin once the tributes arrive at the arena and the competition begins a bloodbath takes place at the starting place and the survivors run off for cover can katniss survive the hunger games this film is not a crisp and perfect adaption of the novel but i think it is faithful to the core and spirit of the story readers hoping to see the novel verbatim will be disappointed as the film cuts out a lot in the beginning including haymitchs hangover at the reaping and katniss relationships with other people in district her connections with her family and gale are shown a bit katniss and peetas drama to lure in sponsors is here although some of it is abbreviated to be frank the film would be close to ten hours if everything were adapted so this abridging is understandable the great thing about this film is that it could be enjoyed by someone who has not read the novel it is sharp and self contained the third person rather than first person pov allows viewers to see more of panem and characters such as the antagonist president snow donald sutherland is perfect as the blofeld like snow and the extra scenes of him provide a few insights into the ideology and feelings of the panem rulers as the competition continues characters like cato a buff and towering tribute from a district where youngsters are fed and bred to be fighters ala ancient sparta are given new and improved spins as he has some sympathetic moments people compare the hunger games to the novel and film battle royale and while they have some similarities they are both examples of a long standing sub genre dating back decades such as the most dangerous game and centuries including mythological examples like tributes sent to fight the minotaur and historical examples of forced mercenaries and glorified bloodshed such as the days of bread and circuses or panem et circenses nothing against the novel the film koushun takami or the late great filmmaker kinji fukasaku but this is not a ripoff or plagiarism the film is well shot with great sets and costumes with the best examples being the contrasting fancy and colorful capitol with decadence and showmanship in everyone and everything and the destitute districts who wear shabby clothes one might find a century ago in slums the violence is brutal at times but it is often tastefully limited with reaction shots and off screen terrors the special effects for the fantastic science fiction of panem such as the train ride in or the elaborate pageantry are magnificent but the muttations leave something to be desired the acting makes the film as jennifer lawrence combines toughness and pure beauty in her role of a heroine stuck in a political game of theater battle and death katniss is strong pragmatic and stoic but there are subtle hints in lawrences performance that allow you to follow her experience despite the lack of narration or first person viewpoint her characters country survivalist life harks back to her unforgettable performance in winters bone harrelsons stumbling but frank haymitch is a perfect incarnation of the novels character even if his screen time is cut short amandla stenberg portrays rue the youngest and most adorable tribute who bonds with katniss and plays a special role in the competition stanley tucci provides some humor as the over the top television presenter ceaser flickerman the hunger games touches upon a lot of political and social themes as well as tropes and story telling arches we have seen before while the book nor the film arenineteen eighty four the characters their relationships and the work of filmmakers and actors to bring this science fiction to the silver screen make this a great addition to dystopic film the hunger games has excitement intelligence and a few surprises all in all a very enjoyable and entertaining film 
i read the books and was really reluctant to watch the movie but im so glad i did it was fantastic so close to the book jennifer lawrence was great and so was the guy who played peeta they had a good chemistry and i am really glad i finally succumbed and watched it cant wait for the sequels 
with all of the hype that ive heard about the hunger games franchise i had to find out for myself just what it was all about i really loved this movie too it wasnt too long nor too short each actor actress went the extra mile to get their storylines across i loved some of the lines that jennifer lawrence said my favorite one being i volunteer as tribute she says her lines with such fierceness poise and restraint yet its enough to have a devastating brilliant effect on the audience donald sutherlands character is a very mean you know what but because he carries out his president snow role so well im willing to look past his brutal personality on the second disc of this set director gary ross and the producers go into extreme detail about how they created this movie and why and because i bought this movie from target it also came exclusive with a third disc which consists of the tributes cast character interviews and diary videos and it only cost me its practically a steal but its worth it for the serious fans i did hear that a third and fourth sequel of the hunger games was coming out in the next or years so please feel free to correct me if im wrong oh and may the odds be ever in your favor thats my other favorite line from the movie 
i havent read the book series but i find the hunger gamesmovie to be very entertaing jennifer lawrence and josh hutcherson relly make the story come to life
fans of the suzanne collins novel will not be disappointed they were as faithful to the book as a movie adaptation could be the casting was superb and the cinematography was amazing 
i would recommend reading the books first as some of the written story is left out of the film normally i would say thats a flaw but in this case it made sense the sets are great the cast emotes the humanity and compassion of the characters i cant wait until the next movie is out 
read the book and loved the movie it could happen to us in the future you never know my next cat will be named katness 
the story line was very interesting kept me glued to the tv acting and special effects were great wanted to watch again so bought dvd 
actually one of the best films i have seen in a long long time my wife also thought it was great and she is not really a movie fan
i love this movie jennifer lawrence is wounderful as katniss everdeen im looking forward to seeing the next movie when it comes out 
the hunger games is not only the perfect movie for fans of the book but is also a most wonderful movie for those who havent read the book sometimes a movie based on a book leaves giant plot holes and its difficult to follow if you havent read the book other times a movie will try to stay true to a book but lose all creativity and excitement when translated onto film this movie doesnt fit either of these categories it is a complete story and beautifully crafted katniss is such a strong and unique heroine its not often we get a strong female who is portrayed full of flaws and strengths that are not lovable but you find yourself rooting for her she is the glue of the whole story the best part of the movie is the way the games are portrayed the sickening fascination and joy the capital takes in having teenagers kill each other is portrayed in a way that is relatable to our own society the pain of many of the contestants is palpable and i was very moved when some of the contestants die another awesome part of the movie the cast jennifer lawrence brings life to katniss in a way that no one else could i wasnt sure i would like josh hutcherson as peeta because of my own ideas from the book but he brought sensitivity and class to the part liam hemsworth is a sexy and strong gale and the rest of the cast is absolutely spot on for each of their various roles elizabeth banks stanley tucci donald sutherland woody harrelson etc you couldnt ask for a better group of actors overall if you havent seen this movie do it now 
there was only one problem with the movie for me the girl looked so much like my granddaughter that it hurt to see her go throught that but the premice was great the story moved quickly and kept me on the edge of my seat im glad she won an oscar because she was perfection 
 hunger games is certainly the best film i have seen since many many months and it is a very successful adaptation of an excellent book in my personal opinion both the book and the film are much deeper and much more ambitious than what most critics and reviewers would make us believe after reading the reviews in new york times le monde and on msn com to cite only few i was surprised that they mostly missed everything that is important in this film with a kind of amused superiority which people from capitol in this movie would immediately recognize the professional reviewers pointed at the obvious allusions to gladiator fights the reality shows the importance of trashy entertainment in todays tv the search for a new franchise able to replace twilight etc etc but they almost entirely failed to see that this film is first and above all about much more important things how to keep hope not lose the courage and preserve humanity and dignity under a totalitarian oppressive regime i believe that almost everybody now knows that when writing hunger games susan collins attempted basically a modern even futurist retelling of the old greek myth of theseus and minotaur according to this ancient tale after losing a war every year the city of athens had to send a tribute of seven young men and seven maidens to the king of crete once there the young people were locked in the labyrinth to be devoured by the monster minotaur this yearly punishment and humiliation lasted until theseus crown prince of athens volunteered to be one of the tributes and once locked in the labyrinth he defeated and killed the minotaur in hunger games what was once united states and i think also canada is now called the panem it is a country divided in twelve districts remaining under the control of the capitol central metropolis there was once thirteen districts but when they rebelled against the central power the capitol destroyed completely the district with all its population and then defeated and submitted again the twelve others in order to remind to its subjects how absolute is its power the capitol claims a yearly tribute one girl and one boy of ages from to from every district the tributes are then send to an arena and forced to fight until only one remain alive this yearly event is called the hunger games and it is shown live on tv to all the population of panem this film tells the story of what happened at the th edition of hunger games for capitol the purpose of hunger games is to remind yearly how powerful is the central metropolis and how dire can be the consequences of its wrath but also and even more importantly in my opinion to humiliate and degrade the people of the districts by forcing them to become accomplices even if under duress of a barbarian custom in which some of their own children are send to the slaughterhouse and as all bullies and abusers know it is much easier to oppress abuse and brutalize victims who lack self esteem well in this film we can see how one of the tributes from district an exceptionnal young girl named katniss everdeen jennifer lawrence manages to turn the tables on the capitol and by allowing people of panem to regain some of their dignity she will be the pebble which starts the avalanche the exact way in which she does that will not be revealed here but both in the book as in the film it is described in a very intelligent and very moving way this may seem a rather improbable thing that a years old child can do something that will ultimately bring down a seemingly invincible and all powerful tyranny but lets not forget that in the real world the great wave of revolutions of arab spring began on december with a desperate gesture of a dirt poor years old tunisian street vendor mohamed bouazizi who set himself on fire after having been robbed and beaten by the corrupt local police one time too much less than two years after the opressive regimes in tunisia egypt libya already collapsed the seemingly invulnerable dictator of yemen had to resign and the syrian brutal regime is facing a massive armed rebellion bottom line this film is first and before all a story about how even a seemingly powerless person can horribly hurt a tyrannic regime with a magic potion made of lots of courage an ice cold determination a great personal dignity a little compassion a handful of flowers a couple of tears and one defiant and powerful gesture the powerful message and excellent scenario are not the only reasons why i consider hunger games as a masterpiece actors were selected very carefully and they perform well jennifer lawrence is simply perfect there is no other word to describe her performance however after seeing her in winters bone and x men first class i didnt expect anything less but the real surprise in this film comes from josh hutcherson who plays peeta mellark the boy tribute from district his character is more difficult to play because peeta is in the same time more limited but also more complicated than katniss josh hutcherson could have very easily fall in one of the many traps which are build in peetas character by overacting or underacting he could have make him a wimp or a passive follower or an immature kid but he avoided those snares with grace and his peeta comes out of this film as a surprisingly complexe and also a very likeable character he is certainly not a hero and a fighter like katniss but until the very end he preserves his honor in a deadly place where he shouldnt ever be send a special mention goes to little amandla stenberg who plays years old rue the youngest of all the tributes her character is both secondary and in the same time incredibly important and this little cute pixie played it perfectly other more known actors contribute to the success of this film woody harrelson is excellent as haymitch the only person from district who ever won in the hunger games and is now an advisor to katniss and peeta lenny kravitz portrayed a perfect cinna the man in charge of image of tributes from district in public appearances before the games begin and finally there is the giant figure of donald sutherland who plays the supreme ruler of panem president coriolanus snow he is purely incredible there is a moment in this film when he says to somebody i like you and i believe that i have never heard such a terrible and deadly threat in one short sentence since the archifamous schwarzeneggers i will be back i also absolutely adored the using of the cameras in some moments of this film we have the impression of going after the characters with a camera like a war correspondent following the fighters this style was also very skillfully used in the shield series of course not all the film is turned in this way but mixing this kind of scenes with more conventional ones gives here an excellent effect the games themselves are very skillfully described and are a very dramatic tale full of surprises and twists i found them much much better than battle royale to which this book and film are often compared the games are deadly and brutal but there is only limited gore i think this film is suitable for young teenagers although not for children younger than there is also absolutely no nudity sex or strong language and i for one found it a most excellent thing there are still many more good things to say about this film but i believe you should discover them by yourself one more thing however about the book it is of course possible to see and greatly enjoy this film without reading the book but i believe that reading the novel first is a good idea if reading the whole book is out of question i would advise to read at least the first hundred pages it will not reveal much about the games themselves but it will allow for a better understanding of some of the key elements the strength of the bond between katniss and her younger sister the history that katniss shares with her hunting partner gale the complicated relation between katniss and her mother and last but not least the mysterious bond existing between katniss and peeta mellark about this last point if you did not yet read the book i do not want to spoil the pleasure of discovery so i will say just this katniss and peeta lived for years in the same village but they never spoke one to another except for an occasional hello and they never touched one another in any way and still they share a secret as big as life and death a secret which both bonded them together and in the same time separated them deeply if you want to know the solution of this riddle you have either to watch very very carefully every scene of the film or simply read the book conclusion this film is a masterpiece i loved it and i am going to buy the dvd as soon as it is available and i am sooo going to see the the second part as soon as it opens 
this is a great movie and amazons playback of the movie is top notch there were no glitches in the playback 
ive never read the books and didnt know what to expect from the hunger games except that it was a combination of the lottery crossed with the running man for preteen girls or if you know your japanese literature battle royale i was pleasantly surprised to discover it is so much more than that the future of the hunger games is basically a roman empire updated to modern times in that respect it reminded of the role playing game x crawl which did much the same thing with a fantasy twist there are twelve districts that send tributes to the hunger games which are basically televised gladiatorial combats in which children slaughter each other every year a raffle known as a reaping is held to choose a male and female between the ages of and there can be only one winner being televised the hunger games is influenced by the upper class citizens of the dominating capitol district contestants are interviewed before the game and during the event can win sponsorships which in turn earns in game advantages like healing ointments katniss everdeen jennifer lawrence volunteers to join the hunger games when her little sister primrose willow shields is selected by lottery her male companion is peeta mellark josh hutcherson and his complicated past with katniss will affect their relationship and the game the game itself takes place on what can only be described as a holodeck like arena that can be manipulated by technicians directed by gamemaker seneca crane wes bentley each team has its own entourage including public relations elizabeth banks as the grating effie trinket a trainer the drunk haymitch abernathy played by a probably drunk woody harrelson and a personal stylist cinna played by lenny kravitz channeling prince these five characters manage to gel nicely on screen lawrence plays katniss as aloof and frequently terrified but with enough steely resolve that you believe she can kill hutcherson looks even more terrified than lawrence and in a twist plays the damsel in distress to katniss vigorous presence banks is a cartoonish reminder of what capitol citizens are like clowns basically harrelson channels frustrated class rage that keeps him in his spirits until he realizes katniss has a chance at winning and finally kravitz does an excellent job of being the only sane person who seems to care about katniss as a human being director gary ross knew what he was doing when he cast this little dysfunctional family if this all sounds like grim stuff on screen it is the hunger games is particularly gut wrenching for parents the children can be as young as so there are little ones who are far out of their depth to the films credit the hunger games never flinches from its basic premise of kids murdering each other although they are more likely to die of deprivation and disease the gamemakers force them into conflict with forest fires and even monsters and its all televised around the clock lurking in the background is the political unrest that the hunger games elicit particularly over the slaughter of children each year while some districts train their children for combat and thus volunteer the other districts enter unwillingly which has consequences for the political stranglehold the capitol lords over them all the state mandated executions have all the pomp and circumstance of a roman gladiatorial bout the hunger games is of particular interest to gamers video gamers will see the constructed environments as quite similar to first person shooters tabletop role players will see the gamemaker role in their own killer game masters this may be the first mainstream movie that makes being a game master cool and if it gives preteen girls someone to look up to whose goal in life is greater than pining for her vampire boyfriend im okay with that 
see it i admit i was leery when i heard the concept kids boys and girls from the ages of are forced to participate in a battle to the death it sounds totally sick right but thats the point its how the government of this future dystopia controls its citizens the game is televised and the citizens are forced to watch most of the adults involved in running the game seem somewhat inhuman and again thats part of the point the game tarnishes the souls of everyone involved the government the audience and the players we the audience of the film are rooting for the heroine katniss everdeen jennifer lawrence who was my favorite part of x men first class if i knew ahead of time that she was the star i would have had no worries about this movie hoping that she somehow survive with both her body and soul intact naturally due to the nature of the story it is quite violent but cleverly held at a pg level i dont advise letting your younger children see this this is apparently the first of a trilogy this first story does come to a conclusion but i can see how it could continue from my perspective the people running the game cheat i have only one negative comment shaky cam must die as soon as possible 
just outstanding the story is clear the actors are giving it their all and the action is just great jennifer lawrence made everything feel real 
this is a very entertaining fantasy movie the acting is great as well as the special effects which keeps you glued to your seat as events unfold its a fine movie and i recommend it to all who enjoy a good movie 
i saw movie frist then read books and in this case i found the movie to track well with book understandibly it omits some to keep pg rating i am legally blind so i read book on cd and seeing movie really inhansed the images cant wait for the next movies and enjoy a good read which i find suzanne collins books to be 
i really enjoyed this movie for its story adventure and moral and ethical challenges the fact that it was filmed in north carolina was a plus also 
if you read the book then you must see the film when i saw the film i thought it was true to the book it had very good special effects it is in the group of harry potter films suspenseful lots of action and adventure i know teenagers and adults will enjoy this fatasy packed film 
i cant even begin to say what a great surprise the hunger games was having recently finished the novel i had concerns over how the film would adapt the first person narrative filled with introspection by the protagonist katniss everdeen and flashbacks to earlier in her life whats great about the movie they didnt try to do that instead we have a remarkably directed almost dreamlike flow through the story the film travels briskly from scene to scene organically blending in backstory that is easy to miss if you arent paying attention rather than filling in the exposition through explanation as the novel does we are given the dystopic scenario and the formation of the hunger games through news broadcasts of the current years games none of this feels forced or even too heavily reinforced the hunger games is the rare film for children young adults that trusts that the audience is an intelligent and mature one it counts on the audience to pay attention as names and details fly by in quick succession there is very little sweet or sugarcoated about this world and the movie doesnt bother to dwell on that the color palette is filled with bleak greys and blacks with some very intense sequences of violence which honestly made me wonder how on earth this movie scraped past an r rating and instead earned a pg in addition to its disturbing content this film is also noteworthy for its strong performances jennifer lawrence as always is fantastic as the lead character and pairs well with her semi love interest josh hutcherson who also gives a well restrained and believable performance following in the tradition of harry potter and the goblet of fire the hunger games is so effective because it feels as authentic as it possibly could given the fantastical elements that are embedded in the story everything else from the characters dialogue the scenery and even the wobbly first person camera work ring true the hunger games is an excellent start to what i hope will be a solid film series it is such an unusual concept for a major studio to pursue and i welcome its confidence to present a film experience that is disturbing harsh and most importantly believable 
at first i hesitant about watching this movie but after seeing it i decided it was a great movie i watch it often because the acting is very good when it is no longer on prime i will most likely buy it for my self 
usually the film version of a good book disappoints but not this time the characters and story line were amazingly spot on recommended viewing 
all science fiction futuristic societies are written to have a message about the current day this is normally contained within the text or a line someone speaks the movie starts giving us some background for the games but we dont know why there was a rebellion in the first place something that is in the book the rebellion resulted in a lottery where teens from the various districts must now compete in a survivor battle to the death all for the entertainment of the audience early in the film we hear if no one watches we wont have a game in other words if we stop watching reality tv shows they will be taken off the air in those other films the evil of society had been either capitalism socialism the super rich corporations religion or science the irony of the film book is that it makes fun of the viewer reader for enjoying it they are the problem with todays voyeuristic dummy down society which like the movie can be divided into two groups those who see the movie games as entertainment and the intellectuals who realize the metaphor contained within im loving it pardon my pop culture response but it seems apropos there is a stark contrast in wealth and dress between those who participate in the games and the society who runs them however it is those who participate who ultimately empower those who run them just like with war the second message of the film which dates from homer war is old men lying young men dying jennifer lawrence who i thought was oscar worthy in winters bone immediately becomes our heroine when she volunteers to take the place of her sister in the hunger games we dont expect her to die anytime soon as the fighting begins i kept wondering if they were going to simply fight for everyones entertainment or are we going to get a captain kirk agorn moment when he has defeated his opponent and refuses to kill him shouting you are going to have to get your entertainment elsewhere or maybe we could end it like death race where frankenstein kills the president but i am getting way ahead of myself the victims or tributes as they are called are paraded and cheered having done nothing similar to reality show tv stars yes i mean you talentless snooki people wildly cheer because they can woody harrelson helps to bridge the time from when jennifer lawrence is selected until the fighting begins donald sutherland appears as an unrealistic unlikeable president snow a composite character representing the evil of society there are interviews and pageantry prior to the games during which time we get to know more about jennifer and very little about the other contestants it would have been nice to have known some of the quirky combatants and have them killed in ironic ways to their character but maybe that was too much to ask about a film about shallow entertainment jennifer with her honesty and rebellious attitude has become the fan favorite and our favorite because she is the only contestant that we know she lacks the killer instinct until she must alliances form and everyone wants to get the fan favorite aka rambette jennifer lawrence who did an excellent job to give girls a heroine being both a compassionate woman and a huntress like all reality tv shows when the drama starts to fade the program directors add an element to push it in the direction that they want no f bombs sex or nudity safe for kids to watch 
the very best of science fiction tends to be memorable for more than just robots space ships and dystopian future what makes them remarkable are the litany of ideas and concepts both large and small presented throughout and if you can do that in a way that looks cool and is entertaining then so much the better its one reason why years later we still admire star wars and why hollywood continues to try and emulate it suzanne collins the hunger games trilogy of novels falls into much the same category a sprawling epic adventure with social commentary to spare and a lead hero in katniss everdeen jennifer lawrence everyone can relate to yet people were justifiably worried about how that scope would be presented on the big screen because more so than harry potter or twilight the exclusion of any single element could topple the immaculately constructed balance between fantasy and brutal realism that collins constructed there is little reason to fear team gale and team peeta fans the hunger games is everything a loyal reader could ask for but more than that its the type of film that promises a truly epic franchise in the making with studios looking to adapt every semi popular novel with the hopes of creating the next twilight few of them ever turn out to have the complexity and depth of character to stand the test of time the hunger games is diverse enough to appeal to the broadest possible audience theres enough of a love triangle to have people rioting in favor of team peeta or team gale yet the action is equally intense and effective without being overly graphic credit immediately goes to gary ross a seemingly odd choice for director who turns out to have been a perfect fit best known for capra esque movies like dave seabiscuit and the visually stunning pleasantville ross is essentially doing the opposite of everything hes done before the deep textured story begins with a simply worded prologue introducing us to the line of thinking that allows for something like the hunger games to exist taking place in the fictional realm of panem where the ruling capitol lords over separate districts each poor in their own way but working to sustain themselves and the government district has had it the worst a mining town that looks chillingly like the squalor of winters bone jennifer lawrences big breakthrough performance she plays a similarly strong fearless young woman with a family completely dependent upon her katniss dotes on her younger more fragile sister prim willow shields and does the work their mother seems incapable to escape the burden of her life katniss occasionally scales the barrier fence into the restricted wilderness to hunt alongside her best friend gale liam hemsworth who has dreams of running away with her to start anew elsewhere the hopelessness of their situation is made more stark by the decadence of the capitol which we see in quick flashes of brightly colored hair an unending supply of food and garish architecture meanwhile the people of district look at bread as a rare delicacy any hope of escape is quickly dashed with the reaping a twisted lottery event held each year to select a boy and girl from each district to compete in the hunger games the youngest have the fewest entries while the oldest like katniss and gale have many increasing their chances of being picked when prim has her name drawn katniss does the only thing she can think of to save her sister and that is volunteer to take her place the dramatics of the situation only brings a smile to the face of the flashy effie trinket elizabeth banks just the first taste that these games of literal life and death are seen merely as entertainment for the ruling class katniss is soon joined by peeta mellark josh hutcherson a quiet and fiercely confident boy she shares a mysterious past with a few rushed good byes later and the two are quickly taken to the capitol for training not just in the deadly arts theyll need to survive against other tributes but mainly in showmanship their mentor haymitch abernathy woody harrelson is a survivor of the games and butts heads with the gruff katniss over her inability to make friends and impress potential sponsors peeta instantly takes to his new found celebrity using it to make a stunning revelation on national television that forces everyone to fall in love with the two poor combatants from district while this would please the toothy pearly white grin of talk show host caesar flickerman an inspired stanley tucci it would draw the unwanted attention of president snow donald sutherland who has a malicious vision for the games that would send a chill up darth vaders spine looking back on when the hunger games was just entering production one of the great debates was who could possibly take on the katniss role in a believable way some felt gary ross needed to aim younger but the decision was made to select the red hot jennifer lawrence and it was a decision that proved to be the right one she is simply phenomenal here capturing some of that awkwardness of youth but also showing a real strength and resolve of someone who has seen too much for someone of her age the search always seem to be on for a new heroine that girls can look up to and unfortunately too many of them have flocked towards twilights bella swan even though she is a character who is who she is because of the guys in her life how interesting would she be without a wolf and a vampire fighting over here not much katniss is different and whether we ever saw peeta or gale and the inevitable squabble for her affections she would still be a character worth following shes incredibly likable smart and tougher than even her male counterparts katniss is a character every girl can actually look up to genuinely one of the most fully realized movie characters of any gender the rest of the cast is superb as well in particular josh hutcherson who many including me felt didnt have the look or the natural presence the peeta role demanded he proves to be more than up to the task showing flashes of real charisma in his verbal sparring with stanley tucci and leading man charm when together with lawrence lenny kravitz is dead on perfect as cinna katniss stylist who sees her as more than just tool in the capitols games how does the film compare to the book well as with any adaptation there are some characters and story elements that need to be dropped ross along with collins and billy ray as screenwriters have managed to maintain the storys integrity while cutting down some of the extraneous portions one of the books prevailing features was that it was seen entirely from katnisss perspective and theyve managed to capture her internal monologue on screen mainly thanks to lawrences emotive performance there are some portions of the story that are intentionally glossed over likely because they will become bigger factors in the sequels which are already in development lionsgate knows they have a hit on their hands so why wait this is a minor quibble and can looked past because the allegorical elements are so on point this is what happens when our celebrity obsessed reality tv culture goes too far it bears some striking resemblances to a film called series the contenders in which people killed one another off in a highly rated television show the easy comparison many have made is to the controversial battle royale but the two arent saying the same thing at all once you get past the surface similarities those who might have been turned off by the extreme amount of hype swirling around the film need to put all that aside and just see the movie this is without question one of the best pieces of science fiction we have seen in years by comparison the hunger games is a better opening salvo than twilight and harry potter delivered by far and the potential for this to to be a significant celebrated franchise appear to be forever in gary rosss favor 
i saw this movie on its opening day release at a local theater to be quite honest based on what i had previously heard from other people a few reviews i was not expecting much from this movie once the movie started i was totally glued to the big screen awaiting every scene like i was in the movie myself i was very pleasantly surprised with this movie for starters though the movie was very long with its steady pace and believable story i never noticed the length of the movie until it was over the people watching in the theater all had their eyes glued to the screen you could actually hear a pin drop this movie will keep your attention the action was fierce at times and somewhat graphic at times but it isnt over the top the drama character personalities storyline all were very evident in the movie as well this movie also depicts the human will to survive human heart the belief to fight for what you believe in no matter what the situation finally what makes the movie for me for me is the acting jennifer lawrence was phenominal what a performance perfect she never flinched in her masterful performance josh hutcherson played a very good supporting actor did quite well in his role as well this movie was a very very good start to what hopes to be several more lionsgate movie releases based on the book series i would highly recommend going to see this movie on the big screen you will not be disappointed i will be reading the books soon thanks for reading my review 
you will be very unlikely to run into anybody this weekend or the next couple of weeks for that matter who didnt like the avengers the superhero movie to end all superhero movies i would be slow to call it a masterpiece but its so likable and action packed that in my opinion it comes damn close director joss whedon lets you know that he was the right one to bring this million superhero powerhouse to the big screen and his cast dosent dissapoint either from my standpoint robert downey jr chris evans and mark ruffalo give the best performances in the film downey espicially since his last outing as iron man was so downright full of himself to the point of nauseam he takes a step back and down from his pedestal to be a team player evans as captain america who is my all time superhero brings us a steve rogers who is still out of his own place and time but always ready to jump into action when the situation and movie calls for it ruffalo downplays the scientist with an angry green man complex role so much that he seems to not be trying all that hard to bring it across not that he needs to of course chris hemsworth was actually better in this film as the god of thunder thor than he was in his own film last year renner johanssen jackson gregg and last but not least hiddleston as the uber baddie god of mischief loki are all excellent in their own scenes with or without the avengers bottom line go see this movie and enjoy every single moment of it 
id rank this movie up there with the dark knight and spider man as the most true to comics feeling that youll ever see on the big screen as a kid growing up i loved the avengers and the way this movie played out is exactly as i envisioned them fighting it out as i read the comics as a kid it was like watching your childhood fantasies realized in comic book form this movie could have been a mess meshing different characters together is a huge challenge but joss whedon pulls it off using nick fury and shield as the glue they gather up all the heroes to stop a crisis without ever crossing that campy or uncomfortable line the actors and writers did their part by adding some strong back and forth repartee between them that will cause some laughs as well as some i cant believe he said that moments the action scenes are top notch most of them true to the comics and the final flurry of an action scene that ends the movie will leave you in awe wishing for more the negatives about this film are few but there are some the film slows down significantly in the middle with a lot of dialogue and not a whole lot else going on maybe they were just building up to the last scene but at times it felt like the movie kind of dragged on a bit before it got good again also the main villain seems to be loki but he actually takes a rather large back seat to the invading aliens which kind of take over the movie at the end it was disappointing to not see loki really put up a fight especially towards the end i know he is the trickster god and manipulation is his game and there are elements of that but it would have been nice to see him do a bit more here than just take a break for large parts of the movie still despite those things this was a movie that once i saw it at the theaters i knew i had to own it on dvd i can only hope the second one is better as the build up has already begun iron man is out at the time of this posting and the proposed villain revealed at the end of this movie left a lot of us drooling for more 
i knew from the outset that this film would be nothing short of great especially after i heard that joss whedon was co writing and directing the film this is the man that has created some of the best television ever buffy the vampire slayer the complete series seasons disc angel complete series firefly the complete series dollhouse the complete seasons as well as some great cinema serenity collectors edition cabin in the woods this comic book film adaptation is about as perfect as it comes its marvels equivalent to dcsthe dark knight two disc special edition however it still has marvels trademark wham bam sci fi dazzle unlike dcs more gritty realism part of the reason i like dc more luckily though whedon is able to pull it all off his perfect talent of blending action drama and humor pays off big time and it doesnt hurt that he has a ridiculous knowledge and understanding of the avengers and their mythology next to the fantastic four the avengers are the perfect dysfunctional family thats one thing they do have over my favorite the justice league i was especially happy to see that they finally got the hulks story right third times a charm id still like to see a female avenger other than black widow but hope she might make an appearance in the new daredevil reboot all of the performances were solid making the movie as enjoyable as can be favorite moment has to involve main baddie loki tom hiddleston and the hulk mark ruffalo every character has equal screen time and their stories given some good light but not too much leaving room for more revelation for sequels one thing dc should do is take a cue from this film and if they ever plan on making a justice league film they should try and hope to get the actors theyve cast in other films i e christian bale as batman henry cavill as superman ryan reynolds as green lantern however unfortunately seeing how bale no longer wants to do batman after this summers film and dc doesnt wish to connect their films i doubt this will happen however there has been recent news that dc is in the process of making a justice league film anyways whedon and company get it right this very well might be the action flick to see this summer theres no more to say other than this film is awesome 
the avengers is hotter than tea sweeter than honey of course it made lots of money but the main thing here is that it is a well written well directed and produced well acted film definitely a comic book and movie fans dream come true i cant wait to the avengers first class stuff 
i have to admit that as a girl in her twenties i have not really had much interest in the comic book world i saw the first iron man and thor with some friends not because it was my choice but because it was what they all wanted however when i went to see the avengers i decided maybe i should give it another go this movie was the ultimate movie experience action plot amazing characters funny dialogue an over all wow of a movie i enjoyed it so much that i had to rent captain america in order to understand more of the stories leading up to this one joss whedon did a phenomenal job with this movie i am so pleased to hear that he will be writing and directing the avengers 
one of the best flicks i have seen in a long time with all the build up over the years form the individual characters movies i had high hopes for this movie and it totally lived up to them i cant wait for the sequel 
what can i say as ive just left the avengers movie its a comic book straight from the pages and onto the screen what marvel fans have been waiting for for years and it all began with the success of raimis spider man and singers x men marvel studios green lit the avengers project that started off in with iron man along with captain american thor incredible hulk and a second iron man this all takes us to this film which i cannot describe other than a perfect adaptation and feeling of a supergroup movie which is harder to do than a solo film there is no filler in this every moment is eyes wide open and moves along at a perfect pace its a perfect translation from comics to film wonderfully casted and no avenger is lackluster everyone shines and all have great screen time even sgt fury kick arse hulk is epic effects and sound are great ill probably see this again director joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer angel firefly as well as writing comic books was the perfect director for this project his vision was epic heres my one word for this movie awestruck or smash cant wait for the blu ray transfer and watch it several more times go see this the dark knight rises is going to have some fierce competition decided to knock this film down to stars sorry batman tdkr is the best comic based film and dont forget to stay through the credits if your a geek like me youll know the villain in the sequel genius and one does not simply leave a marvel movie without staying till the end 
ok i am finally writing a review of a marvel film after reading a lot of avengers fantastic four iron man x men when i was young i felt this film version hit all the right notes pitch perfect and made each character memorable distinctive and extremely charismatic iron man captain america and thor already had tremendously successful eponymous films of their own but the truly inspired full break out character introduction in this avengers movie was of course the black widow she was also featured in iron man ii but really came into her own as a vital and most intriguing essential character in this film this was an inspired choice because the black widow former top soviet spy named natasha romanoff later international jet setter and eventual shield agent was actually in her early comic days sort of a second tier character though popular enough to have a short lived series in the early marvel s amazing adventures then as daredevils beloved side kick for about issues before elektra came on the scene but it is really scarlett johanssons mesmerizing portrayal in this film who completely epitomizes the famous definition of the true real black widow spider i e the enchanting creature for which the male spider will gladly and most willingly sacrifice its own life in order to couple with having absolutely no regrets whatsoever about his fateful decision darn now i completely lost my train of thought anyway yes now i remember the second inspired burst of creativity was to re invent the characterization of the hulk mark ruffalo finally brings what has been sadly lacking in the earlier hulk films the pathos in the character of bruce banner of the brilliant but lost bewildered mild mannered scientist who knows that he really cant control that raging beast within him but does his best to stay calm nonetheless ruffalo imbues the character with the perfect mix of uneasiness even vulnerability against that just under the surface explosiveness keeping the audience constantly on edge anticipating the next transformation ingenious and tom hiddleston makes the character of loki the epitomy and definition of mischievous even in the midst of endless death destruction loki has the wry wide eyed smile constant grin of the proverbial kid in the candy store much kudos must also go to writer director joss whedon who has a brilliant track record with fantasy adventure scifi entertainment and even wrote a brilliant re imagined x men comics series to boot even the great marvel father stan lee must have been pleased beyond his wildest dreams with this truly epic film speaking as a nearly life long marvel comics fan although i have not kept up with all the modern mythology excelsior ps a special thanks to black widow and the rest of avengers for keeping the sochi russia winter olympic games safe and free from incident except for that slushy snow i guess they forgot to include iceman from that other marvel super team the uncanny x men amazing closing ceremony by the way especially chagall chekov and mischa the now apparently friendly bear das vidanya and especially peace be with you mr bear or else we might need to call in the silver surfer to bring forth some positively cosmic good vibes note especially for comic book fans another highlight from the late s black widow actually became the leader of her own short lived super team from marvel of course called the champions which also featured hercules ghost rider the angel and our much needed in slushy sochi the iceman it was an interesting concept and this team was rather offbeat diverse but unfortunately only lasted a mere issues from and featured some great early john byrne artwork 
we watched this at the theater in imax d so watching a blu ray of this film at home had a lot to measure up to i would say that it was quite acceptable we watched it on a lg with passive d the image was crisp and the d added in my opinion to the viewing experience over watching a standard blu ray and i think that standard blu rays normally look pretty good i doubt i have to fill anyone in about the subject of this movie it takes several marvel super heroes who have all had their own films leading up to this and puts them in one epic package true to the marvel taste for most of the film they do not get along well with each other but come together when it counts to fight an exhausting and dangerous battle against seemingly impossible odds but what else are super heroes supposed to do lolthe acting is convincing and there are quite a few moments of humor to give you a break from the more serious tone of the movie a defect in the otherwise brilliant movies in the new batman series the sound in this presentation is simply outstanding i dont remember another film which has driven my subwoofer more powerfully or effectively the rest of the sound comes through powerfully and crisply too there is no problem with level balancing between the score the sound effects and the dialogue if you like super hero movies this very well may be the best one ever released 
at this writing i have the honor of being the th person to place a review for the avengers an as yet unreleased dvd i shall attempt to write with all due aplomb the avengers is exactly what escapist movie fiction is supposed to be when real life contains as many terrors as hollywood can dream up we need to laugh and cry and jump and shout at the screen to relieve those tensions to refer to this as war porn as i saw one reviewer did is to underestimate the powerful purgative and emotional effect that purely enjoyable movies like this do this is a clever movie it begins by introducing the villain loki then two of the least well known superheroes in the avenger stable hawkeye and the black widow only quick clues about them are given but theyre enough for the movie to progress to tell you the truth ive seen the movie twice and i still dont have any real idea what the black widow does regardless one by one the superheroes and their supporters are brought to light the hulk iron man thor and captain america eventually all make it to s h i e l d s home base and occasionally flying aircraft carrier the helicarrier it isnt long before they all begin to fight among themselves and as we all know from lots of film viewing were going to need a reason to bind together that reason comes in the form of the death of someone very close to the circle of heroes and unite they do all of this isnt terribly important im very sure some similar components would have occurred regardless of who wrote the film it isnt hard to figure that you have a bunch of superheroes and they all have egos the size of their talents so you know it would be difficult for them to bind together apparently some similar plot was being put together for its original date of release in the summer of but various factors required that the movie be pushed back a year and along came joss whedon who took the script in hand rewrote it and became its director and thus was birthed this version for those who dont know joss whedon has put together hit tv shows yet has had little respect among the powers that be nor a really successful show in a decade once a writer on roseannes tv show he wrote the original movie buffy the vampire slayer then convinced the studio to allow him to re create it as a television show he went on to win an emmy for writing and the show lasted five years on two networks in whedon went on to create the cult classic and oft called space western firefly which despite its strong core fan base nicknamed the brownshirts was cancelled after episodes even though they had shot later this strong fan base encouraged universal studios to wrap up the series in a two hour movie called serenity which again underwhelmed despite the browncoats the same went for dollhouse a show that only ran two years a victim again of low ratings other than a couple of fan favorites like dr horribles sing along blog a short starring neil patrick harris shot during the writers strike joss whedon had done little else that wowed anyone how he was able to land the directing post of the avengers i simply dont know but thank god he did for instance talk to anyone who enjoyed this film and ask them their favorite scene and youll be hard pressed to find anyone who doesnt tell you right off the bat its one that involves humor and not coincidentally the hulk whom ill get to later and that in a nutshell is what joss whedon brought to this movie whedons humor is ever present in his work whether it is billed as a drama or not and it is this humor that is at the heart of the avengers it is through whedons jaundiced eye that we see these six superheroes interact and it is through him that the story gains its humanity think of it the very fact that such oversized and super powerful beings exist even with the blessing of hollywood is funny and that they must co exist for any of this to work well thats hilarious and it is this that lies at the heart of this extremely entertaining movie what characterization that exists does so not to make our heroes super but human it is whedons genius to set his eye upon the all too normal traits that lie at the heart of all of us vanity pride fear of failure competitiveness and even the desire to erase that part of us that we wish others not to see it is not that the characters can fly that wows us it is that even he or she fears falling i have heard some minor complaints about the drag at the middle of the film when our heroes are weakest when they fight among themselves but i think it is this scene that makes the movie believable that speaks to a deeper dread the crisis in this movie began when we sought to make bigger weapons and making bigger weapons drew the eyes of bigger enemies if one thinks of it the worst criminals never show up until there is a superhero worthy of them there was no madman named joker until there was batman no evil lex luthor until superman on a more well human scale perhaps the greatest beneficiary of whedons careful eye is the incredible hulk who has been regarded far too seriously in each of his two big movie outings thus far as portrayed by both ed norton and eric bana and hey even going back to bill bixbys tv hulk the big guy has just been too serious it is only under whedons watch that he has blossomed and in such a way as to provide many of the movies best moments we even get to hear hulk smash and it is so good to hear the audience laughing along with the character rather than at him but as long as were on the subject some credit must go to mark ruffalo who has humanized the hulk as well with his gentle but knowing performance as the hulks better half dr bruce banner his dark rumpled face is perfect for the man whose monster lies within a man who knows all too well what it is to walk around with a terrible secret who cares if the movie goes a little awry in the end having politicians decry our heroes for the damage caused to the city and who else is getting tired of every movie that depicts nyc as the perennial victim not when weve had such a wonderful joyride getting there this movie is a pleasure from start to finish speaking of which stick around for the credits and a little beyond there are two little fun snippets of film left as easter eggs for the fans who care enough to stick around 
great movie non stop action really spectacular effects the whole group together makes for an almost family reunion of a supreme fighting force 
seen this movie twice already and it was just as enjoyable the second time this is such a well done movie with plenty of awesome action intensity and some great one liners the way the movie builds up to one of the most bad battles i have ever seen is just perfect so much tension between all the super heroes and the way they come together gave me goosebumps highly recommended if you havent seen this yet and i would say see it multiple times because you will just want to 
i saw this a couple years ago and thought it was ok i like the iron man movies but the others are just ok for some reason i wanted to see something about this the other day and found that i could watch it for free now as a prime bennie so i did last night and i was blown away i didnt know joss whedon wrote and directed this or i would have paid better attention the first time that was a brilliant move hes the best there is of course the acting was excellent and i really appreciated the characters interactions with each other the tension was palpable and believeable it set up the climax perfectly one thing that was incongruous was the flying aircraft carrier still dont get why fury would want something like that no benefit and obviously many risks the key to this films greatness is that it relies the most on the interactions of the characters rather than the battles and the key to the interactions is the brilliant casting which of course was taken care of far in advance by marvel when they assigned these folks to their separate movies before this payoff blockbuster but again with anyone but whedon at the helm it may not have been this great now i see there is a sequel in the works might even be done filming by this time everyone but most especially whedon is back watch for avatar box office records to be broken 
captain america and hulk smash full of humor drama and loads of avenging action makes it one of the most brilliant superhero feature films to date it even gives batman begins blu ray a run for its money there is honestly nothing negative i can say about this film except for one thing but thats a spoiler for those who havent seen it yet iron man is still iron man hulk is the best hes been yet and theres no team quite like the avengers who at lego would disagree to them making a series about this film i recommend lego hulk helicarrier breakout and for you avengers collectors lego quinjet aerial battle is a must have the casting is brilliant the action is great and the villains are threatening and self absorbed for the last one mainly loki these lines sum up the film for you loki i have an army tony stark we have a hulk all of you out there in short go see this movie five out of five iron man if we cant save the world we can darn well avenge it 
this has to be one of the greatest films i have ever seen after having the pleasure of seeing this movie eight times in theaters im literally counting down the hours until i can snag this dvd having seen all of the previous films leading up to this one i can say my expectations wer extremely high now all i can say is that i wish i could go back and see it for the first time all over again this film sprung me into a new world of comic books and all that marvel has to offer and i love it but more about the actual movie joss whedons direction was magnificent in every way he really captured that marvel film quality that all the previous movies had with that enticing combination of witty one liners and bold action that you just wont see anywhere else all of the characters really meshed together in a funny shaky start that lead up to a fantastic blend of amazing heroes in the end all of the actors did a phenomenal job in grasping their characters and taking them deeper than just what you saw and might i say mark ruffalo did a great job as bruce banner he played the part of the closed off and awkward scientist well if you didnt see this in theaters you missed out not only was the film amazing on the big screen but the audience full of die hards made it a real experience id recommend this movie to anyone looking for a laugh action and and just plain fun there also wasnt much language which i thought was great for the younger audiences who will undoubtedly see this game changer if they havent already 
this movie is so much more than a super hero action film although theres plenty of that i dont want to give any spoilers so ill just sum up this is my husbands type of movie last night he talked me into watching it with him i am so glad it is unexpectedly a great story not just a bunch of fighting and crashing and senseless violence the special effects dazzle me how do they make it look so real i am a fan of thor ironman captain america and the hulk now i cant wait to see what ive been missing i figured as did everyone else that loki would be returning for more mayhem in something without giving thing away he returns here with his vengeful glory seeking temper pitting hero against hero friend against friend and brother against brother i was on the edge of my seat shouting at the tv for half the movie the rest was spent in omg and laughter yes laughter so unexpected at the time with hilarious antics the hulk really does a number on loki i just cant say enough good so ill end with it is a must see before i give too much away 
good price and bought it for the digital copy ive seen it a few times now when traveling and never disappoints 
the avengers was awesome and much like the x men with the wolverine spin off the movie has improved all the way with joss whedon directing the whole story line went up a notch and if and when there is another thor iron man and captain america it will be great similar to batman the dark night with christian bale all it takes is the right stars and directing and the dark knight sequel has improved the whole batman series a thousand times well to not spoil the movie for anyone they had a great choice for the incredible hulk mark ruffalo which was more like the original character versus the ones in the previous incredible hulk movies there was constant action and supporting stars like samuel l jackson added to the movies overall story line i look forward to seeing the next avengers but this one is really a keeper i hope the next thor and captain america come up a notch to complement this movie 
after five origin movies iron man iron man the incredible hulk captain america the first avenger thor the avengers ares finally assembled in an action packed film directed by joss whedon putting all these superheroes into one movie couldnt have been easy but joss managed to give all the characters screen time some more than others the movie is a little slow at the beginning but it picks up about forty five minutes into it i never cared for loki in last years thor but the character has grown in the avengers i was skeptical about mark ruffalo playing bruce dr banner hulk but he played the character wonderfully finally we get a hulk that actually resembles the comic hulk the alien invading plot has been done to death most recently intransformers dark of the moon but it worked out well in the avengers overall i loved the dvd and i though the movie was great thanks to josss quirky dialogue 
i loved this movie and so did other family members this was a gift for one of my sons i enjoyed it at the theater with another son 
its been called the greatest superhero movie of all time whether you believe the hype or not you have to admit there is something undeniably charming about the avengers in the hands of writer director joss whedon this film is a rollicking good time not serious in the sense of chris nolans batman films yet not campy like the joel schumacher batman films fans of whedons work will immediately know what to expect nonstop action blended with a strong and quick sense of humor under laced with nuanced character development the film pits some of our earlier favorites downey jr s ironman helmsworths thor evanss captain america against loki this isnt the lokia from thor however here tom hiddlestons villain is transformed into simply a bad he kicks butt and doesnt bother with names oh yeah and hes bringing an invading interdimensional army of nasties can our crew rallied by samuel l jacksons stalwart nick fury stand up to the onslaught of course they can theres no doubt about that ever this is an utterly optimistic film and therein lies its charm dont get me wrong im a nolan fan i love his batman films their flaws and all but theres a lot to be said about a film that revels in the utter majesty of the superhero with a childlike wonder these guys can do no wrong and they dont this is a fun quick fanciful film in the grand tradition anchored by a superb script whedons known for that in case you werent aware and stellar acting rejoining us are scarlett johannson with a lot more to do than in iron man where she was basically eye candy clark gregg wholly ingrained in this universe as agent coulson gwyneth paltrow stellan skarsgaard and others the avengers welcomes jeremy renner as hawkeye cobie smulders as agent hiller and particularly mark ruffalo as bruce banner the hulk some of the films most memorable scenes revolve around the latter character and his innate desire for destruction vs his inner conflict ruffalo is partially responsible for the former and entirely responsible for the latter and perhaps deserves an oscar nom though he wont get one here is the true strength of the avengers aside from its pure joy factor not one single character actor carries the show you may think that with a superstar like robert downey jr onboard that he film will follow ironman and the others will be supporting roles not so this is an ensemble film plain and simple ironman loki and the hulk may have some of the more memorable scenes but this film belongs to the entire cast and crew it is indeed a film in which everyone contributes and the end product shows the effort whether or not you believe the avengers is the best superhero movie yet made personally i dont but thats one mans opinion you cannot deny that it is certainly among the top tier it is delightful hilarious thrilling and plainly fun you can ask for more yes but you probably wont get it the avengers delivers plain and simple 
i dont buy many d movies but when i do they are avatar and the avengers sound and picture quality of this film are incredible and the d gives just a bit more depth to the picture than the standard d version of course in this package you get all versions adn the digital copy is perfect for importing to itunes plenty of extra features to enjoy as well totally worth it 
i enjoyed this movie so much that i went back on amazon and watched captain america and thor to understand the dialog and character connection it was even more enjoyable the nd time when i understood their banter i had already seen the hulk but would watch it again soon also 
i went to this movie hoping it would be at least ok boy was i wrong this movie balanced all the characters and was highly entertaining this might have been the best superhero movie ive even seen and i think ive seen all of them so thats saying a lot my wife and i are looking forward to seeing avengers ii in a year or so the plot and character development was exceptional writing and acting was superb cgi was very well done and was for the most part necessary for the story this was the rare movie that i would have preferred to have been a little longer the blu ray picture was great as was the sound it will be most interesting to see if they can even match this production on the next outing highly recommended i would rate this at the very least to out of it was very nearly a perfect movie 
good movie i enjoyed the humor an action i will not review if i have to add words to satisfy a friggin computer 
what a lot of fun the marvel movies deliver again very entertaining all of the very different characters are pulled together with great chemistry to save the earth yet again 
watched on a lg lw passive d panel and pioneer bdp player this is the d blu ray to have it looks amazing so much better than it did at the cinema the movie is absolutely fantastic so well done that it performed a miracle created demand for a new hulk movie indeed its the big green guy and tony stark who shine in this film but all the avengers get their time in the sun thanks to joss whedons fanboy dream script full of his customary intelligence and humour visual effects look absolutely stunning on the digital transfer only minor carp should of been shot in widescreen extras are a bit thin expect more tricked up editions down the road a must have 
well its finally here the day all marvel freaks have been waiting for a decade has passed since we heard rumors that this titan team movie was in the works the avengers is without a doubt a complete success and for once lives up to the overwhelming hype not ignoring character development the avengers manages a pretty tough feat the story is long but never boring and even though it takes time to develop its like a simmering pot that we all know is going to explode at some point and when the pot does explode it explodes like no other superhero movie has ever done first off having captain america iron man thor the hulk hawkeye the black widow and nick fury in one movie seemed impossible to give each character their due but the avengers does just that fury could have been better utilized and i cant get used to jackson playing the part i grew up with the scruffy cigar chomping bada white guy version from the s but this film pulls off the impossible i never once looked at my watch in its two hour and twenty five minute length besides having a very ambitious story the action sequences are the best ive ever seen in a film of this nature the film has many comic moments which had the entire audience roaring with laughter with the hulk who is properly sized for once delivering in spades this time around i guess they owed the character that much after two sub par feature films he and robert downey jr steal the show and give us those classic moments a popcorn film of this magnitude needs to keep everyone focused in on the fact that this is a film about comic book characters each character is given time to shine and having origin films for the main quadrant helps a great deal i cant imagine how theyre going to top this one the avengers rivals the very best of all comic book films including spider man and batman begins and the d which i usually find distracting is the best ive ever seen trailers for the new spider man reboot and batman films were also presented in d even if youre not really into superhero films this is the summers must see movie get a tub of popcorn and prepare for an incredible movie experience and you will want to stay all the way to the end of the film as there is a false ending showing one of marvels heavy weight villains before a funny ending scene a few minutes later i hope marvel reboots the fantastic four with a cgi thing that could at least give the hulk a fair battle the four disc blu ray edition is very nice but one small gripe they stacked two of the disk top of each other which i find really cheap for a set that cost this much i mean really how much does a swinging hinge cost i bought the tin collectors set at best buy and quickly gave them a new home in the superior case though the new case didnt have room for the digital copy which dont use any way the transfer looks and sounds fantastic with bonus material a plenty 
 the avengers is brilliant this is the lord of the rings of comic book movies colorful epic and emotionally powerful this is one of those rare movies that just gets it right in every way weaving together half a dozen superhero movies into one shining whole you need to have seen some of them to understand whats going on captain america the first avenger thor iron man and iron man but its well worth the effort loki tom hiddleston suddenly teleports into shield headquarters and immediately steals the tesseract before the entire compound collapses he also brainwashes a bunch of people including master archer hawkeye jeremy renner into being his minions so nick fury samuel l jackson decides to call in a group of people with very special skills to stop loki and get back the tesseract steve rogers captain america chris evans tony stark iron man robert downey jr natasha romanoff black widow scarlett johansson and bruce banner the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth also literally drops in on them and reveals that loki is commanding a monstrous army that the tesseract will allow into our world but even after they barely manage to capture loki they soon discover that the trickster god is always a few steps ahead of them and hes even manipulating them against each other this fragmented group of volatile heroes must learn to fight together or face a world where loki and his chitauri army reign supreme the avengers is the movie that michael bay would make if he werent a racist misogynist hack it has massive explosions a flying battleship and a city smashing finale that involves giant armored eels but it also slows down sometimes to allow us quiet moments where the characters can grow like barton and romanoffs talk its understated but powerful i have red in my ledger id like to wipe it out but since joss whedon wrote and directed this its also a witty tight script with lots of deliciously funny lines doth mother know you weareth her drapes and moments the hulks assault on loki he knows how to intertwine action and character development and his explosive kinetic battle sequences always end with a sense of bittersweetness there are losses and there is pain jackson downey johansson hemsworth and evans all slip smoothly into their familiar roles the white hot renner gets fleshed out nicely as the quiet stoic barton and ruffalo is surprisingly good as the nerdy fragile man with a rage monster seething under the surface and hiddleston is devastatingly good as loki who is now desperate to make himself a god king but still shows occasional flickers of regret and uncertainty there are a few changes to the familiar characters and they work particularly captain america who is a bit angsty about the loss of his old life and its a nice touch that the avengers dont really get along at first since all their personalities are so different it takes a massive shock for them to realize we need to work together or everything is lost if i had to criticize something it would be that the first ten minutes are rather rushed and captain americas costume looks more cartoonish unlike his grittier wwii uniform which combined patriotism and practicality the avengers joins together a bunch of separate stories into one wild explosive epic a brilliant story that sets a new benchmark for superhero movies on to the next round 
unless you are the sort of cinematic snob who can only appreciate avant garde short subjects in tiny projection rooms then chances are pretty good that youll have a rollicking good time watching this megawatt adventure epic i certainly did and i wouldnt consider myself a die hard marvel comic book fan i enjoyed the derring do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one but director screenwriter joss whedon really whips together all the formula elements that madeiron man the incredible hulk the version thor andcaptain america the first avengerpurely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger than life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable a top notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their d eye popping glory of course but much of the credit really needs to go to whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book running a surprisingly fleet minutes the potentially convoluted plot allows nick fury a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post credits scenes in the previous movies to take center stage hes the surly one eyed leader of s h i e l d the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with loki the deceitful half brother of thor the norse deity of thunder loki has brainwashed archer supreme hawkeye and brilliant physicist dr erik selvig already seen in thor while stealing a cosmic cube called the tesseract a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential from a remote research facility fury recruits black widow a former russian spy last seen in action in iron man to gather the troops including a highly reticent bruce banner a k a the hulk meanwhile iron man captain america and thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the chitauri which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of manhattan while the state of the art action scenes are everything you want them to be its really the films unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story realizing the escalating level of implausibility whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone and not just robert downey jr for instance after thor proclaims loki solemnly as his asgardian brother black widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which thor points out loki was adopted later in the most crowd pleasing scene the hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip slams him into the floor like hes beating a dust rag the defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here and whedons kid like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating the physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble while downeys scene stealing as iron man is a given chris evans captain america chris hemsworths thor mark ruffalos digitally altered hulk scarlett johanssons black widow and jeremy renners hawkeye all get their moments to shine as loki tom hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning while samuel l jackson and clark gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as fury and agent coulson respectively the mistake most filmmakers make in showing an armageddon situation is applying too much soul baring gravitas to the proceedings thats definitely not whedons take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life its gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory 
i dont know how they are going to top this one i enjoyed it from beginning to the end i cant wait for the dvd the hulk rules in this movie 
if joss whedon doesnt do avengers it will be so disappointing this could not have been an easy movie to make and whedon nails it hes the first director to get the hulk right unlike so mnay team up movies it never feels like any characters are being underserved or overserved and its just fun okay so the iron man turbine scene was a little silly and went on for too long but if thats the only thing wrong with it thats still an accomplishment the best part thor shouldve been the character no one really cared about so the plot revolved around him captain america shouldve come in second so they made his character arc the most compelling and fraught so when its iron man downey can just be downey and the hulk can be used just enough i never liked black widow until this movie even hawkeye a throwaway unnecessary addition on paper works well here and the real real best part tom hiddleston as loki a weaker villain and it wouldve fallen apart a weaker actor as bannner and it wouldve fallen apart whedon makes it look easy truly a movie for the ages 
it is an impossibility to have access to the modern media centric world and not know about a hugely successful film that is called the avengers not only was it one of the most successful films of all time gaining money hand over fist for one reason or another but it was actually a film made for the fans by one of the biggest fans one joss whedon a man who has a horde of fans so devoted they would have watched the avengers if it had starred muppets the movie is in every way a creation of genius and love of source material rantand that is where the buck stops jarringly so for extras we get two featurettes a hand full of deleted scenes which by all rights should not have been deleted and a very dry commentary track from someone this reviewer came to think could talk about drying wallpaper and make it interesting not so i am left with the feeling that disney said to joss now we know youre good and youre name may be a huge point to this films success but you absolutely cannot mention firefly serenity or dollhouse oh heres you commentary script too dont buy a shinier version for expected extras buy it on dvd if you were thinking of getting a bd player any time in the future buy it now and then make this film the first bd that you watch make no mistake this film has changed the way franchise films should be produced we are just left hands wavering in waiting wanting the tidbits of extras we figured wed get on such a huge production rantoh yeah the avengers film did kick i did say that already yes 
the best movie of the year the best marvel comics movie ever made if this movie could be described in one word it would have to be epic 
joss whedons the avengers is a perfect movie with very minor flaws watching the movie filled me with the awe excitement of a true spectacle well at the same time making me genuinely laugh out loud also making me feel for these soldiers out of time flawed men in armor assassins seeking redemption gods who make mistakes marksmen trying not to miss the target scientists filled with anger all the actors involved pulled me in catapulted me through this massive vision of powerful beings colliding physically mentally joss showed the innate property of marvel characters though they may posses abilities beyond normal humans they still feel have flaws make mistakes have good days bad they are still grounded in humanity even the demigods that you begin to identify with their struggles want them to persevere win the day joss whedon only he could have assembled such a great movie he truly deserves the adoration of movie goers worldwide 
ok ok everybody knows that the avengers was an excellent american film and anybody that doesn t just wants to be special this movie was funny interesting entertaining and very clever there is technology and the backstories for all of the characters is believeable wonderful climax and a believeable and teasing ending good work to all of those involved in the creation of the avengers movie 
i have to admit i had my doubts about this one it seemed like they were cramming too many heroes in one flick and we might just end up with a batman robin mr freeze poison ivy batgirl batman robin bane combination disaster im glad to write that i was pleasantly surprised in the case of the avengers the way in which the heroes were brought together was done in an entirely believable way as loki thors brother and the villain of the flick seeks to open a wormhole by which a lot of bad guys can flow through it seems the earth is the sacrificial lamb for his power grab the concept of having a flying aircraft carrier seems like it would be a disaster and indeed i mumbled that to myself when it first took off but thats actually the fun of it they bring the bad guy on board and youre just waiting for all hell to break loose and it does robert downey jr was again great as iron man and his well placed dry humor led to laugh out loud moments finally finally they didnt mess up hulk mark ruffalos portrayal of the hulk blew his predecessors away this was not ang lees shrek lookalike hulk admittedly similar to thor this movie lacks the punch it had in d format in the movie theater but that wasnt enough for me to not give it stars this movie is a lot of fun and worth owning 
i didnt know what to expect but after enjoying thor and iron man had to give this a try this is a rollicking ride all i can say is you have to check out his abc television series agents of s h i e l d where joss whedan finally gives us nerds our flying car in the gorgeous form of lola a classic red corvette the acdc music is perfection and when stark is told he needs a plan of attack his reply is perfection i have a plan attack what a great ensemble cast fromthoralum stellan skarsgrd and jeremy renner superb in award winning filmthe hurt locker to harry dean stanton who greets the hulk with are you an alien no answers dr bruce banner the hulk well son youve got a condition great scene when the hulk whacks the pretentious loki around he has anger issues whedan takes us on an explosive journey pushing the boundaries of the cinematic experience he clearly is influenced by the classic british doctor who with unit and the tardis etc but takes everything to the next level when iron man ascends up to another dimension and then falls back to earth we are with him all the way enjoy 
this hour long movie achieves the rarest of feats it manages to not feel like its hours long the pacing and storytelling of the avengers is incredible and i was entertained throughout it surely goes without saying at this point but the special effects are top notch and the transfer to blu ray gives your hi def tv the workout it was built to handle best of all this movie is laugh out loud funny giving viewers especially marvel fans a real treat most surprising of all is the great chemistry that exists between the huge cast of characters none of whom are wholeheartedly interested in the idea of a team of superheroes robert downey is his usual witty self and has so much charisma that his arrogance is endearing rather than off putting chris hemsworth and chris evans each do a serviceable job in their roles although hemsworth never quite gets the same momentum that he achieved in thor probably because we dont get to see his earlier fun loving side my favorite performance was that of mark ruffalo as hulk banner the hulk is my favorite comic character and i thought that norton and bana each did a great job portraying bruce banner in the previous movies but ruffalo was a great choice and his mannerisms and delivery of lines seem just right for the precarious life of banner with such a loaded cast of heroes on screen marvel and disney do not disappoint they seem to have been fully aware that fans would want all out brawls not just a united battle against some vague enemy as such we get to see wonderful battles between the lot of them with the prize going to a showdown between powerhouses thor and hulk aboard a flying aircraft carrier anybody who had even a passing interest in comic books when they grew up will take great pleasure in watching this destructive rumble between titans there are a couple of hiccups in the cast unfortunately loki still looks like an extra from the slitherin house of a harry potter movie and i have no idea why in a movie of this colossal budget they would wardrobe him in a cheap costume that looks like it was purchased on a budget at iparty he never comes through as a convincing villain and his acting is best described as angry melodramatic teenager but i thoroughly enjoyed his battle with the hulk that was great the black widow and hawkeye do a decent job holding their own although its kind of silly to see two regular humans trying to keep up with thor and the hulk characters who are essentially demi gods and all but invincible you would think they would at least invest in a helmet or something hopefully they will have a smaller role in the inevitable sequel leaving more screen time for the heavy hitters despite these small hiccups the avengers is a fantastic action movie with strong influences pulled from the ultimates an alternate universe marvel take from about ten years ago its hardly deep and it doesnt answer enough questions leaving room for the sequel but it does what its supposed to do it entertains and on an epic scale 
fun just plain fun let me get the one negative out of the way first why does every villain have to take over the world apart from the overly familiar villains scheme everything was flat out fantastic the characters that had real depth the truly standout character was the hulk in the first hulk movies you couldnt wait for banner to turn into the hulk here banner was so well written empathetic and likable that you felt his fear about turning into the other guy and rooted for him not to turn into the monster stark was back to his fun lovable egotistical self that made him great in the first one black widow became a real person you felt caps fish out of water ness coulson was just great dialog was witty clever and fun lots of humor not just humor thrown in the humor completely fit the characters and the situation marvel took its time and carefully crafted a terrific movie this wasnt a thrown together cash grab as you would expect a sequel combing several successful franchises marvel did this movie right so marvel please bring back the writers cast and crew right down to the grips for avenger because you made magic struck gold bottled lightning with the avengers 
in this avc encoded p transfer in this movie pops the level of clarity is great lines and detail are sharp and even though a lot of the movie is dark it doesnt ever look muddy or hard to see the special features while arent plentiful are still pretty good i am looking forward to the joss whedon commentary track as well as the marvel one shot short film that premiered at comic con item there are a bunch of deleted scenes a few featurettes and a gag reel i wouldnt be surprised if they put out a few more editions of this movie with more features in the coming years for now this is good enough for me especially since i bought this for the movie and the movie itself isnt going to look any cleaner or sharper than this 
i am more giddy than my giddy aunt i saw the midnight showing of the avengers last night and at the end my face hurt and warped from grinning so big i am so wired i cant form a coherent thought heres a salvo of stream of consciousness impressions in whatever order mark ruffalo is simply terrific as the hulks alter and calmer ego i actually prefer his interpretation of dr banner over banas and nortons ruffalo steers away from the deadening angst that made me fidget in earlier hulk pictures he finds a balance this banner exhibits a dry sense of humor but exudes this quirky low simmer edginess and i love ruffalos interactions with downey jr two swaggerful eggheads matching their test tubes against each other and applying big sciency words i like that theres respect between their two characters theres an intriguing twist involving banners relationship with the hulk of which i wont say more the hulk and this seems to be a unanimous impression hijacks the movie comic book geeks like me have recently been dogging marvels latest company crossover event avengers vs x men and yet this film demonstrates that sometimes theres nothing more exhilarating than eyeballing an epic hero vs hero scrap mjolnir meet the hulks face and have you ever wondered what happens should thors enchanted hammer go up against captain americas indestructible shield the plot revolves around the far ranging machinations of loki asgardian god of mischief those whove read the avengers comic book origin should note a smidgen of familiarity but only a smidgen the tesseract someone mistakenly thought tesseract sounds cooler than cosmic cube plays a part the bad guys whom loki recruits as an invasion force arent skrulls not exactly but they do pose an extinction level threat alarming enough that some assembly becomes required captain america is well utilized here although im hating his awkward modern day costume i vastly prefered his more practical wwii outfit but maybe i just like pouches joss whedon joss whedon his storytelling has big scope it has grandeur whedon orchestrates a sprawling high profiled cast and just about gets away with not slighting anyone he does rely some on your familiarity with the character development sunk into the prior films he manages to tie in various plot threads from previous marvel pictures although stark cap and banner get the lions share of the spotlight whedon devotes time and space to side characters like the slinky but lethal spy the black widow and the likable unobstrusive agent coulson if you assume the black widows defining action moment surfaces in that early interrogation scene youd be all kinds of not right scarlett johansson ticks off whedons buffy box not only in things asskickery but also in terms of strong character beats the widows dialogue with loki happens to be an acting showcase shes so much more here than when she was featured in iron man but if i were to pick out two people who may have been underused theyd have to be maria hill and hawkeye i do feel that cobie smulders was wasted i love that like in the comics thor never gives up on his half brother the first half hour is essentially a slow burn set up that may or may not keep you engaged and at times whedon does sacrifice narrative for those wild action sequences and thats okay because whedon treats us to a series of marvelous cape on cape violence in true marvel fashion these heroes harbor instant grudges against each other but all those violent misunderstandings merely whet your appetite joss unleashes the white knuckle action in the third act the extended climactic combat sequence as the avengers hold the line against a horde of grotesque not skrulls is off the charts and so damn gratifying theres this now famous tracking shot in which im reminded of the s x men cartoon in which the camera would often track the x men in frenzied action as they hurtle in and out of the picture occasionally mingling with each other only to break off again into individual skirmishes i was mesmerized by whedons sweeping organic approach to the battle scenes no surprise there are heaps of whip smart one liners plenty of them generated by a smirky robert downey jr and yet even hemsworths regal thunder god elicits chuckles no contest though the brutalizing hulk who by the way is rendered to savage life in impeccable cg captures two of the films biggest laughs for pure escapism and sheer fanfare and fan service beyond expectation the avengers is the best superhero movie i have ever seen i have to see it again but you you make sure to stick around for the embedded scene during the post credits and then for the post credit scene you may wet your pants or you may afterwards go what the flippin flip was that hours and hours later im still big grinning joss whedon actually pulled it off what i have is the blu ray disc edition i must say im digging the crystal clear hi res video quality of the blu ray disc weve probably all gotten spoiled by the extras on the lord of the rings packages so the following bonus stuff probably wont overwhelm anyone audio commentary by director joss whedon marvel one shot item a short film in which

being a fan of comics and the marvel universe and after seeing all the other movies leading up to it i obviously had pretty high hopes going into avengers and after finding out a while before that joss whedon was going to be directing it i had a gut feeling it would be well done because joss whedon is an awesome director i went within the first week with my wife and a few of our friends made a whole day out of it i enjoyed just about every minute of that movie from start to finish all of the characters were really well done it helped that each of the directors from ironman hulk thor and chaptain america came on board to help advise whatnot and each actor played their parts very well at first my only one real concern was that edward norton was not going to be returning as bruce banner but after watching the avengers i found that mark ruffalo was a bit better for the role in the end he played the nerd card a bit better than norton i thought the special effects were fantastic i found myself totally pumped and on the edge of my seat during the action bits in the movie and the effects done during those scenes were very well done in my opinion in my head my hopes for the quantity of action was about right on maybe just a tad higher but really not by much the action sequences incorporated into this movie were just simply awesome the comedy added into this movie screamed joss whedon looking back on buffy the vampire slayer firefly and whatnot and there was just the right amount in it it was added in at just some of the right times and they were great i laughed pretty good in those scenes the story was well done and is close enough to the comics as far as my recollection it has been some time since i have read some avengers comics obviously not every little detail would be added in because thats almost impossible to do when youre converting stuff from a story that spans quite a ways i imagine it differs when transferring from comics as opposed to books too there is so much detail in books but at the same time its probably very difficult to transfer every detail within animation and whatnot as well all in all bravo on the story though of course thats what you get too when you chose a director like whedon who grew up reading comics and knows the material and has a real passion for that kind of stuff youre going to get a good movie all in all this is a well rounded superhero movie and may well be the best one ive seen thus far right up their with the dark knight which is probably my favorite dc movie up to this point if you have not seen this movie please please please do yourselves a favor and go watch it comic fan or not its freakin great even the action fan who isnt a big comic book lover would enjoy this movie i have already preordered about the best version of this movie that is going to be available because its worth it even with the d although i dont have d capability i dont really care its worth it in my opinion because this was such a kick movie definitely check it out 
i have been a comic book fan since i was eight years old long before it was popular and am so excited to see what they are doing with comic book movies now marvel has done such an amazing job turning their properties into entertaining movies for the most part daredevil ugh dc not so much i just want to mention that at heart i am a die hard batman fan batman was the very first comic book i ever owned that being said i felt like this movie was better than the dark knight rises call me a traitor if you like but i felt like the rises story was pretty weak this time around i was concerned about this movie from the beginning i didnt know how in the hell they were going to make a good movie with so many heroes involved and i didnt know what villain they were going to conjure up that would be sufficient enough to bring these heroes together well they succeeded buy it it is so amazing 
words cant express how much i enjoyed this movie my only complaint would be the lack of black widows abilities we see a glimpse of her great fighting abilities in the beginning but then we are left with her using tiny little pistols that scream uselessness oh well everything else was amazing hilarious action packed great graphics good packaging a 
every so often something magical happens in hollywood a movie comes out thats so big so epic in scope that it can only be called epic such films have included gone with the wind star wars and titanic and now the superhero genre joins their ranks with the avengers what just may be the biggest most amazing superhero film to ever grace the silver screen the avengers tells the story of marvels biggest heroes captain america thor iron man the hulk black widow hawkeye and nick fury must join forces to combat a threat so great that if they fail the earth itself will fall to put it simply the avengers is the most epic superhero film ever made a rather big statement to make but the fact that it even exists is nothing short of astonishing a massive cross over film where multiple superheroes from multiple films comes together with the same actors from all of them well save the hulk to act as the climax to a series wide storyline thats been in the works for over five years now its a miracle that it even came together and that it works what is so great about the avengers is that its so much damn fun weve been following captain america and iron man and all the other heroes as they had their origin stories and now that all the exposition is out of the way the film gives us exactly what we want superheroes saving the world beating the crud out of lots and lots of bad guys and bantering with each other from the halfway mark to the very end the avengers is a non stop barrage of action and incredible sequences that took my breath away often from the action and also from laughing at the near endless stream of hilarious moments in a wonderful surprise this is the funniest superhero film ive ever seen but i wont spoil any of the jokes yet balancing out all the action were many little character moments that make each hero come alive with their own refreshing touches such as black widows desire to overcome her bloody past or captain america wanting to keep everyone together when theyre all in danger of drifting apart even among all the explosions punches and hammers the avengers has a strong emotional core and makes us care about our heroes as they plunge into battle are there any flaws with the avengers well the story can be pretty weak at times lokis motivations his plan for the avengers etc and theres an awful lot of talking early on do any of them matter i was having so much fun that i didnt care in the slightest cheering with my fellow audience members laughing with them and gaping in amazement at the spectacle before us for two glorious hours all of us were kids again caught in the excitement and sheer wonder of larger then life heroes working together to save the earth the avengers is not just a superhero movie its an event a film that oozes fun and coolness on par with seeing godzilla fight king kong its a sheer joy and for superhero fans its not to be missed 
this past summers greatest movie the avengers is here with tony stark as iron man thor son of odin and god of thunder dr bruce banner and his alter ego the hulk captain america former wwii hero and super solider the black widow spy for sheild along with hawkeye crack shot with an arrow the avengers are ready for action or are they nick fury director of s h i e l d has been called to a secert testing facitlty where the cosmic cube is being tested is creating a great deal of radation gamma as it is discovered without him knowing doctor solvig who thor meet while on earth is under the control of loki who through some slim chance has survivied and now seems bent on conquest and has brought him forth to begin his plans to claim the prize he was denied on asgard fury trying hard to stop him with his agents not under loki control escapes the facility and realizes that only a few people on the planet can stp him wanda maximoff meanwhile recives a call from agent colson who informs her she needs to bring in doctor bruce banner knowing what that entails and discovering what has happened to hawkeye she goes in search of the elusive banner meanwhile fury tries to get steven rogers aid in understanding what the cube was used for by the red skull back in wwii and what it could mean if it was used as a weapon again however steven rogers is still trying to deal with the fact that everyone and everything he ever knew is gone and he is in a world that doesnt seem to need a solider like him anymore in new york tony stark along with his girlfreind pepper pots are about to bring stark tower online and unveil that arc reactor power source that will generate not only the tower but the nearby city blocks as well and recives a vist from agent colson on who delivers information to him regarding what types of devices would be needed to track down power sources while thor has caught wind that loki is alive and on midgard must return and find him and bring him forth to his father so he may face judgement with all these egos and powers on hand can they come together and stop loki and his plans will the world be saved or will it fall into the hands of loki himself check out in mavels the avengers to find out 
i have to say that im very happy to find out that this movie is one of the very few motion pictures that support the appropriate aspect ratio that most people if not all would like to enjoy in their movies why such a big deal about this aspect ratio for those of us who already hate the so called black bars on top and bottom of the screen while watching a regular movie the aspect ratio of on d home viewing brings back those horrible black bars and with that taking away from what makes d worth the purchase to begin with minimizing the effect by a big percentage usually i dont mind those black bars on d viewing maybe because we are all used to it by now plus it doesnt take anything away but on d viewing this is the complete opposite so whats the appropriate aspect ratio that should be in d home movies most d movies right now are not being released with the desirable aspect ratio that will fill the whole screen giving you the whole d effect but movies like wrath of the titans and the soon to be released avatar d are some of the very few that could display with an average aspect ratio of which will take advantage of the full screen of your new d tv as you expected to display from day one with that said this movie fortunately does support that type of aspect ratio which makes it completely worth the extra few dollars on the d bluray version even with an enormous tv set you wouldnt want to watch a d movie with the black bars because the bigger the tv the bigger the black bars about the movie in general i did love this movie when i went to see it in imax d i think it had a good use of the technology story this is certainly the best comic to film translation and yes i did like batman the dark knight rises but not as much as this one special effects the special effects although not groundbreaking they were certainly eye candy and what really makes it stand out from the pack is how well the director and his team were able to put everything together and make it look amazing all around and even better in bluray d and its amazing aspect ratio taking advantage of the entire screen about the d effect although the movie was not originally shot in d it displayed great in theaters and it does as well for d home viewing if you have a d tv and a d bluray player this movie will certainly make you proud of that investment i know it did for me

review from metalarcade net the best hulk movie yet thats what a lot of people are saying about the avengers and while that is absolutely true its much more than that its an incredibly fun film overflowing with action and yet still making time for real character development and even some truly great comedy i tip my metaphorical hat to joss whedon who has pulled off one of the most exciting and engaging superhero movies ive ever seen whedon is a certifiable geek genius and his passion shines through in every frame of this film having helmed buffy and firefly hes become very adept at bringing a team together and giving them some heart theres no better example than in the fact that the hulk was one of my favorite characters in this movie when ive previously only seen him as boring and one dimensional i have to give credit to mark ruffalo as well for making this character very watchable rather than groan inducing if youve seen any marvel film in the past few years you know full well that sam jacksons nick fury has been trying to wrangle together a super group of superheroes together for his avengers initiative the film has a very basic premise thors loki tom hiddleston has attacked the earth with an alien army and the only way to stop him is to get the band onstage that would be the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson captain america chris evans iron man robert downey jr and hawkeye jeremy renner thats a lot of characters to balance and i went into the avengers fully expecting the film to be cluttered confusing and disjointed its a small miracle that the film is not only easy to follow but incredibly fun to watch the dialogue between the team especially when they first meet is excellent and often hilarious and never feels forced nobody feels shoehorned in and there are so many epic action sequences that i almost felt worn out by the end of the films runtime the theater i saw it in was packed to the brim much like the film itself and although i had to crane my neck the entire time i couldnt take my eyes off the screen it almost feels like a lucid dream speaking as a comic fan because even though the film has been hyped for years its difficult to comprehend the awesomeness of seeing all these great characters and actors on the same screen its a bit cliche but it is the closest thing ive yet seen to a comic book come to life and its every bit as awesome as i hoped its just an exceedingly fun movie which is very rare these days every character is at their best in this film captain america is as patriotic and no nonsense as ever and iron mans vicious wit is always hilarious and never overbearing ruffalo manages to imbue bruce banner with a few new layers of heart and lends him a distinct personality that was sorely lacking from hulks previous film entries we also learn what makes black widow tick and she is genuinely interesting this time around rather than just a ridiculously hot female in tight leather which i still would have been ok with but at least women wont have any reason to complain about her and she kicks a lot of ass in this movie its not spoiling anything its in every commercial to tell you that there are a few battles among the heroes in this movie i wont give away who fights who but rest assured that these battles are even cooler than they were in the comics and executed very well theyre also not just done for the sake of awesome fight scenes as it realistically shows off the wildly differing personalities of the team which definitely dont quite gel together at first its not necessary to watch all of the heroes previous marvel films to understand the avengers but it definitely gives the characters and their interactions more depth i would say that thor is the only must see film before the avengers as the films villains are the same person and his motivations and the brothers personalities become much clearer upon viewing that film the members of the s h i e l d team notably maria hill cobie smulders nick fury sam jackson and agent coulson clarke gregg all get much less screen time than the main cast which is to be expected but they all are handled well with coulson and fury feeling much more fleshed out after viewing this film overall the avengers can be seen as nothing short of a huge accomplishment everyone in the cast gives their best performances thus far and bounce off of each other perfectly joss whedon infuses every scene with heart and excitement and youll be on the edge of your seat for the entire film i can only hope that the dark knight rises and the amazing spider man match my expectations as well as the avengers has 
this is the super hero movie ive been waiting for since i was ten years old and never thought id see it was superlative dont go to this movie expecting citizen kane but if you have any sense of fun i dont know how you couldnt enjoy it keep in mind this is really a sequel following hulk which i have not watched captain america stars and thor stars so it helps to at least be familiar with what happens in those movies before you watch avengers i really wasnt expecting that much when i walked into the theater the first time i saw it but was delighted to be mistaken yes you could complain that captain america is a bit wooden decent actor limited part gaps in development in his solo movie so this character suffers slightly as a result and the plot is a bit thin from the start but very consistent with comic plots so be aware this is to some degree art imitating art which might be disconcerting if you arent familiar with the characters ahead of time but there are a lot of inside jokes and details for marvel fans on top of the snappy patter and some slick deceptions that i think most viewers missed so there is some modest intellectual appeal im not much for special features so youll have to look elsewhere for comments on those 
the avengers is rightfully getting credit as one of the best superhero movies the genre has to offer long but well paced the mix of intense action and clever dialogue keeps the interest level high throughout and all of the actors give fully entertaining performances on the action special effects take center stage but i never felt like any shot moved too fast to follow what was happening or that anything looked overly cgi as for the dialogue it includes a healthy dose of humor but its typically more witty than corny and a couple of scenes are downright hilarious and the acting showed great chemistry among all of these characters ive seen most of their solo movies and they stick closely to the personalities already established in those films the only one i havent seen is edward nortons incredible hulk but mark ruffalos take on the character is one of the highlights of the avengers not only is he very authentic and convincing as bruce banner but i enjoyed the hulks scenes more than just about anything in the movie in fact hes in what i think are the two funniest scenes i dont want to spoil them but they involve punching thor and slamming loki around like a rag doll both completely cracked me up on a last note loki provides a perfectly sinister villain to drive the plot and keep the stakes high and almost makes the movie seem like a half sequel to thor even though the expectations for the avengers were ridiculously high i think director joss whedon and the cast have met them and given fans a real treat if you see this in the theater make sure you stick around for the two easter eggs in the credits one gives a big hint about the sequel and the other is a wry but very funny punch line to a joke from near the movies end theyre both worth sticking around for even if you have to go to the rest room as badly as i did great movie by marvel and whedon i cant wait for the next one 
loki has made an arrangement with the alien race named the chitauri he is to go to earth and find the tesseract and open a portal into space so that the chitauri can send an army to conquer the world they promise that loki can be the ruler of the earth loki wants to rule the earth but he also wants vengeance on his adopted brother thor the tesseract is an ancient artifact of unlimited power that by legend comes from asgard and was owned by odin some on earth are trying to harness its power to generate unlimited energy to light the world while others want to use it to create weapons of mass destruction the tesseract begins emitting energy pulses of its own accord and it opens a portal through which loki arrives on earth loki uses a saber energy weapon to convert some of the people into his followers and to kill others loki and his followers steal the tesseract cube and shoot director fury loki has taken a key agent clint barton jeremy renner hawkeye and the main scientist for the project the cavern the laboratory is built in collapses and a crater a mile across is created as the tesseract runs out of control from the overload of energy director nick fury samuel l jackson barely escapes with his life while loki and his team escape with the tesseract cube director fury brings together a team of super humans a god and a pair of assassins to form a team called the avengers the team members are thor iron man black widow the hulk captain america and eventually hawkeye and the task is simple defeat loki and conquer the invading aliens or face the destruction of the earth this is a fast action film filled with marvelous special effects and a good storyline i loved the interaction between the avenger members the action and at times the comedy was wonderful this is a top notch film and i really enjoyed it from start to finish this film was entertaining and my family enjoyed it a lot i recommend it to you 
obviously everyone will have their own opinion but i think hands down this is the best comic book movie ever made and possibly one of the best all around action adventures ever made the d on this blu ray looks surprisingly good ive only viewed one other movie on a d tv so my experience is limited but i thought this looked great maybe even a little better than in the theater since i can choose where to sit im only starting to delve into the special features but so far theyve been very entertaining at this point i think im going to upgrade to the massive set theyre releasing next year just to see what other goodies theyll have added this is such a ridiculously good buy at dont miss out 
i was very satisfied with the outcome of this movie very action packed as expected and all that you want in a superhero movie i was thrilled to have gone to see this and now i cannot wait for the dvd release i simply must have it each character was depicted so well and their back story did not stray at all there were so many pleasing twists throughout and there was even a spot of humor captain america and hawkeye are probably my two favorites you will not be disappointed after seeing this movie 
finally the one weve been waiting for well one of them anyway the avengers written and directed by joss whedon arrives in us theaters today and its one of the few movies thats absolutely worth the wait whats good joss whedons script nobody does it better when it comes to blending both characterization action and storytelling in sci fi his repertoire is on full display in this flick not a single character gets shorted despite the size of the cast and the movie flows nicely forget dragging theres barely time to catch your breath around here from bruce banners nervous mannerisms to maria hills cool competence everyone gets some attention to detail that makes them human and not merely characters youre gonna love agent coulsons reaction to meeting to captain america for the first time and without a doubt the best scene in the movie is hulk vs loki being a superhero movie you gotta have references both to the source material and beyond whedon shows his love and reverence of the genre by loading the movie with homages i think i even caught a great darkness saga reference in there if i have to explain what that is forget it and whats a whedon script without the humor from the amusement of a couple of running jokes and a couple of comedic bits that man is playing galaga he thought we didnt see him but we did to some straight up laugh out loud moments this is one of those movies that brings everything together so well it makes you wonder how so many others can keep screwing things up cough green lantern cough whats bad honestly very little i thought the beginning was rushed so we really didnt get to see what the chitauri were all about how loki found them and why he was allied with them they were just there and they were coming to earth given that its a two hour plus movie whedon couldve spent a little more time on them and captain americas costume just didnt look quite right the rest of it visuals are excellent i dont go to d movies but there were a couple of shots that made me wonder what theyd look like full on the shield helicarrier was like the death star designed by earthlings and the hulks rendering was spot on even the alien monstrosity skimming the skies of manhattan looked like a part of the scenery it was destroying forget the hunger games the avengers is the first true blockbuster of the year and deservedly so because it exceeds all your expectations this is a very satisfying highly entertaining movie and of course you gotta stick around until the end of the credits you will not be disappointed 
with the avengers joss whedon has made the best superhero action adventure film i have seen in years thanks to his superb direction a very good script co written by him and great acting from his cast of which the most noteworthy performance may be mark ruffalos as dr bruce banner the hulk ruffalos performance as banner is esepcially memorable portraying him as someone barely in control of his emotions lest he transform himself into the hulk is it artistically the best superhero film of our time such honors should be conferred instead on christopher nolans batman films especially his first one the dark knight and perhaps jon favreaus first iron man film however i dont think i have had as much fun in watching a film since peter jacksons lord of the rings trilogy that ive been eager to see the avengers twice simply to catch any of the great special effects i had missed the first time and more importantly superb acting from ruffalo especially a priceless scene with veteran character actor harry dean stanton scarlett johansson black widow and the rest of the cast though robert downey jr steals every scene he is in either as wealthy industrialist tony stark or as iron man while audiences will be impressed with the superb special effects i believe they will also appreciate the fine acting exhibited by the actors portraying the avengers the villainous loki tom hiddleston as well as others including clark gregg s h i e l d agent phil coulson cobie smulders s h i e l d agent maria hill and stellan skarsgrd selvig whedon and his co writers have written a very entertaining script showing how nick fury of s h i e l d samuel l jackson assembles his avengers initiative of superheroes acting in response to lokis theft of the tesseract a mysterious energy source and lokis plans for world domination believe all the hype with regards to the avengers this is one terrific superhero film with a stellar ensemble cast that will be remembered as among this years best films 
i loved the movie satisfying balance of humor and action without taking itself too seriously but youre either going to love this movie or hate it it is what it is so let me instead praise the on demand streaming video quality the audio was pleasantly leveled so i didnt have to turn it down in the loud parts and crank it up for the dialogue and the shadow detail is very good the dark scenes of loki conspiring were much more visible in this stream than in the streaming version of thor from other paid sources good job amazon 
this is what a comicbook movie is suppose to be like sure there were moments that defy logic but this is not a movie based on reality its a comicbook movie for me the hulk stole the show poor loki make sure you fast forward during the credits because there are after credit buttons 
ive seen it twice in theaters and both times blew my mind it has everything a good popcorn flick should have good action funny dialogue and unforgettable characters i was afraid it would be little over bloated with so many superheroes see spiderman but boy was i wrong every character is nicely fleshed out useful and gets their time to shine tom hiddleston as loki was perfectly cast i loved him in thor and in avengers hes even better he is completely delusional full of himself and comical at the same time hes the kind of villain that honestly believes in its own greatness and as such he deserves the praise which gives him the justification to make people kneel in submission where he lacks in physical strength he makes up for it in manipulation deceit tom hiddleston got him down as they say the smirk the anger and over bloated ego im proud to call myself a loki groupie i cant wait for my blu ray to arrive so i can bask in his glory 
possibly the best super hero movie marvel has produced so far i could just end the review right here but i wont prime shipped on time on release day and came with discs as described bluray dvd it also comes with a redeem code for a free avengers poster and digital comic however there is a setback with that s h clearly optional but im just glad i got the movie four years in the making that lead to this marvels the avengers six extraordinary people are called together to stop a global catastrophe whats not to like about this already everyone has already said all the great stuff about it so im not going to continue beating a dead horse short break down overall the film has a great story thats been built up for the last years it has an interesting plot a great cast of heroes even greater action witty humor and its just overall fun for everyone even those who have not read a comic book in their lives this is marvels first step at showing how vast the universe really is this is the first movie in a very long time that instantly became one of my all time favorites just sharing the love 
im gonna keep this short as everyone has said pretty much everything there is to say about this film it is hands down one of the best movies ever made ever the only concern i had about the movie going into it was the casting of mark ruffalo as the hulk but then he turned out to be the best part of a film that was made up of nothing best the best parts of any and all films for anyone who is iffy on watching comic book films give this movie a go you are guaranteed to love it 
wow thats all i can really say about this movie really it was better than i expected and then some loki loki loki a tortured soul and such a good villain man he really hates his brother thor damn talk about family issues loki opens the portal and goes to earth to destroy it of course and thor appears to take him home thor runs into iron man and joins s h i e l d to help take down loki of course theres nick fury who brings them all together to s h i e l d black widow goes to collect the hulk bruce banner aka bruce krenzler to help s h i e l d iron man joins and captain america captain america thor the incredible hulk black widow hawkeye who was previously lokis drone in the first half of the film and iron man all join together to bring down loki and his alien drones from destroying earth the humor was better in the movie thanks to joss whedon the action was awesome and the story was better a must see for all the after credits spot sets it up for the future marvel sequels i hope captain america iron man and thor nick fury is rumored to have his own movie but well see no plans as of yet to give the incredible hulk another movie 
lets cut to the chase we already know why youre here you want even more vindication that joss whedons buffy the vampire slayer dr horribles sing along blog film the avengers is worthy of your hard earned dollars i give it five out of five stars if you keep up with my reviews you know this is not a rating that i hand out lightly so i will give you some reasoning first and most impressively every single actor is given an equal amount of screen time in this film did you love samuel l jackson as nick fury in his brief cameos from the other films youll see plenty of him did you think robert downey jr was the perfect fit for iron man as i do youll get your fix were you impressed by chris hemsworth as thor scarlett johansson as black widow jeremy renner as hawkeye or chris evans as captain america in previous appearances you wont be disappointed each character is also provided an ample introduction for you to become quickly acquainted with them or to jog your memory of their powers and origin and if you are already familiar with both then these scenes compose a pleasant calm before the storm mark ruffalo has been cited as the best hulk yet better even than bill bixby according to radio personality and hollywood babble on co host ralph garman while i first found this to be sacrilegious i knew i had to see this film on opening weekend to see if i would agree in addition to my adoration for tony stark i would have never chosen ruffalo for bruce banner and yet he was impeccable i was just as wrong about him as i was about heath ledger being the joker in the dark knight ruffalo masters a nervous tic so well that you find yourself feeling bad for him you hope he doesnt become the hulk even though you still hope he does just so he doesnt have to experience the anger and pain that come with the transformation ruffalo truly is the best hulk loki the villain of the film is played by tom hiddleston and is sexy probably in part because he is so evil he is a great counterpart to thor as his brother thor is someone i was never personally interested in and to this day i have yet to see the film however i must eat crow and say that hemsworth possesses a much finer acting ability than i initially believed he would i took him for an airhead he is not even close i am now interested in seeing thor based on hemsworths performance in this film there are almost as many scenes of comic relief in the avengers as there are action packed scenes believe it or not the hulk provides some of this much appreciated wit some have said that the last third of the film is one long running action scene i found the entire film to be very few scenes were slowed down this was a film where you either kept up or got left in the dust it is two hours and twenty minutes of non stop action the dialogue is witty and the acting is so well honed that i found myself scoffing at the academy as i watched the scene between loki and thor at stark tower how can they continue to dismiss comic book movies for a chance at the oscar when great ones such as this are continuously churned out even if you havent seen captain america thor or either of the iron man films even if you know nothing at all about comics but love action films i strongly suggest you see this film and if you are a fan of all of the above then there is no reason why you shouldnt see this film its even great for kids as there isnt much profanity and there are few scenes of graphic violence rottentomatoes com gave this film a rating and they know their stuff i give it five out of five and i like to think i know mine 
best superhero movie ever literally basically no doubt sure cannot wait to buy this as blind buy the firstday it comes out on bluray i plan to go see this the nd time around soon i caught the midnight show last night and it wasvery well worth my money go go go go go go see it yall if you havent already d
they are all here and magnificent this is another movie that makes you wish you had another to watch right after as with all marvel movies the action both live and cgi are excellent the storyline is superb you never want for something to get your attention captain america is brought into focus as the team strategist i particularly liked the way the hulk was given a little intelligence there at the end 
this one is a great movie from the stand point of super hero films that is this is fun with all of the actors from their own films that came before it all the marvel super hero movies are full of cgi special effects and lots of action so it is the summer films of a few years that the avengers fit into not exactly like the comic books that they were originating from and updated for the s it all come together now in a real good movie with a lot of plot and personality in it the best acting goes to iron man aka robert downing jr he acts the part of tony stark as a drunken genius egotist learning to get along with others nick fury as samuel l jackson is in authority and commands respect the hulk is sympathetic with mark ruffalo in green skin captain america played by chris evans from his own movie the origin story fills the part of inspiration and tactics leader and is cute too a norse god thor as big as life in chris hemsworths body with armor from asgard to look like something out of mythology itself the new guys the black widow and hawkeye are both featured in this film each hero gets his time in the spotlight this is comic book readers dreams of super heros come to life a wonderful movie 
what can i say it was christmas the only two weeks of the year when i shift my brain to neutral and just enjoy stuff like mint frosted brownies and egg nog with old charter this fit right in with my agenda guilty pleasures honestly i watched all the related flicks and am waiting for the next thor to come out on dvd there i said it 
i watch this on my kindle fire every other night while im going to bed i watch thor on the other nights the soundtrack is great and i almost always fall asleep before finishing the movie 
movie review the avengers wow the best film of the year to date joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer firefly toy story did what every screenwriter and director should do in all movies make the audience care about the characters and as a result well follow them anywhere and believe everything this movie has action adventure drama mystery intrigue gadgets technology and two extremely important aspects heart and humor starting from droplets of all the other films before it iron man the incredible hulk iron man thor and captain america the first avenger this film tells the story of the brother of thor and a mystery off world villain loki played deliciously creative by tom hiddleston warhorse midnight in paris thor plotting an evil destruction of the planet earth thanks to the incredibly funny and sharp performance of samuel l jackson pulp fiction star wars the phantom menace the incredibles as the s h i e l d nick furry leader along with another character like jacksons sprinkled though all the previous films agent coulson played succinctly by clark greg the shield mr poppers penguins thor who both got the avengers team together to battle this deadly enemy who obviously an egomaniacal madman what great about this film is the believability of all the super heroes and their alter egos top of the performances were robert downey jr chaplin sherlock holmes due date as ironman and the hysterical ego drive alter ego tony stark and chris evens fantastic four the losers push as captain america steve rogers their chemistry and their electrifying performances made for exciting drama and comedy every time they were on screen and chris hemsworth star trek thor cabin in the woods reprising his intensely innocent yet strong performance of the demi god thor he wields his hammer like never before in fact one of the more memorable scenes involves a fight of basically egos with ironman and thor only to be broken up by captain america with some humorous results the more subtle performance of mark ruffalo shutter island going on zodiac as the hulk was a great contrast and motivation to the avengers team and who know the hulk could be so so so funny real but still funny another starlit moment can be given to the added intrigue of the black widow natassia and her dark past to the team as cleverly played by scarlett johansson the prestige the island iron man for me there was one throw away character the hawkeye clint played by jeremy renner the hurt locker the town mi ghost protocol not really vital to the story or the team but he was honestly performed and he did have a few cool gadgets other characters returned like gwyneth paltrow as pepper pots and paul betteny as jarvis both the assistants of billionaire tony stark although one is a computer the movie was edited extremely well you can follow all the action and the alan silvestri back to the future forest gump night at the museum score gets you pumped up and going again this is a greta fun and funny film for the whole family technically up to speed that youll be amazed at the gadgets and youll never be taking your eyes of the screen over million in its first weekend i think it will be around for a while 
thor and loki from asgard make the movie period without them even if they used other superheroes i think the movie would be boring for lacking an emotional component that is provided by the brothers fractured relationship i really felt very sorry for thor having to deal with his insane brother and loki was pure evil entertaining for sure but pure evil nonetheless i dont know how loki can be redeemed from evil to just wicked but i hope somehow its managed in thor ii which doesnt come out to next year of course everyone talks about robert downey jr and even the man who played the hulk but it is the asgard brothers thor and loki that gives this movie its heart update the bluray dvd is great its just like watching the movie in the theater that is if you have a high definition p tv which i imagine most people do by now 
this is a good movie it is full of action sad funny will watch it again im sure 
if you havent seen iron man iron man thor and captain america where the hell have you been seriously those movies are a must for you to understand the entire story of the avengers now anyone who knows me knows i am a huge marvel junkie was from way back in the day when i collected comics i am very picky about the way the marvel superhero movies are done i was extremely please with all the iron man movies thor and even the nd hulk movie not a huge lover of the first hulk movie or captain america but at least captain america was tolerable compared to that first hulk movie eric bana is bad hulk i love robert downey jr as tony stark aka iron man every movie he plays this role in seems to me hes getting better at being tony stark i love chris hemsworth as thor i can tolerate scarlett johansson as the black widow and samuel l jackson as nick fury i like chris evans thats why i saw captain america even though i am not a huge captain america fan i am extremely delighted in jeremy renner as hawkeye cause he really looks the part and his acting is always spot on tom hiddleston as loki flawless as always i just wanna hug loki for some reason where my major concern was was of course where most fans concern was the hulk aka bruce banner mark ruffalo plays this part and he nails it i mean he reminded me of bill bixby in the original tv version of the hulk i was so pleased that the hulk finally got someone right to play his part and then hulk smash and the hulk says some stuff i was so pleased that someone finally got the hulk right on screen even if that someone was someone i am essentially mad at by the name of joss whedon ah joss whedon he who killed buffy the vampire slayer for me by season of the series with all the story line bs of the key and buffy going all psycho yes that joss whedon so he is behind one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen gah and i have to admit that ok joss you win this round still mad about some things from buffy but when it comes to superhero movies you did the avengers some true justice so thank you this movie is everything that a marvel avengers fan would want and with the ending a promise perhaps of a sequel crosses fingers i saw the avengers in d its my first ever d movie since i was and saw king kong i recommend seeing it this way because it was totally awesome from start to finish a little hard to keep up with some of the action in some parts but it was well worth it for the effect of it all overall i think this is the superhero movie of the year if not decade we superhero fans have been waiting for this and its everything promised and then some great awesome hulk funny moments too i wont ruin the movie at all for you see it see it now 
one of my favorite go yo movies thor was my favorite comic book read no not a deep plot just good vs evil 
i hate that i have to write anything on these reviews for anyone who hasnt seen it avengers is a great way to kill a couple of hours decent action and storyline enough sci fi tricks to appease the trekkies and treksters dovetails nicely from the iron man movies as well spoiler alert scarlett johansen is hot in leather 
its pretty clear that marvels entire film making machine was leading up to this effort a movie that nobody thought could be made because it involved hollywood putting aside egos directors joining forces and intellectual property being leveraged in such a way that everyone plays nicely together behind the scenes even if the characters dont play nicely together on screen somehow god bless them marvel actually pulled it off picking up where captain america thor and iron man left off the strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division shield led by nicky fury samuel l jackson commands a ragtag band of agents that just happen to work on a flying aircraft carrier maria hill cobie smulders unfortunately miscast clint barton jeremy renner not quite as sarcastic as he should be as hawkeye and natasha romanoff scarlett johnannson as black widow their mission is to retrieve the tesseract aka the cosmic cube from asgardian loki tom hiddleston and his predator like race of alien soldiers known as the chitauri there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong and part of the avengers success is that marvel took its time building up to this moment with its previous releases asgardian god hero thor chris hemsworth could easily become a walking caricature but hes such a tower presence that he demands to be taken seriously steve rogers chris evans as captain america is slightly diminished here but he settles comfortably into his role as a brilliant tactician out of time but not out of his depth all these serious characters are just banter fodder for tony stark robert downey jr as iron man who shamelessly stirs things up when things goes down the one worrisome character was bruce banner mark ruffalo as the hulk with two tepid films under the characters belt the hulk was potentially the avengers weakest link no need to worry the hulk is one of the best parts of the film ruffalo plays banner as a scruffy doctor without borders a brilliant man who gives off a zen vibe because you wouldnt like him when hes angry joss whedon master director of all things geeky knows how to build up anticipation whether its the massive firepower thats never brought to bear against banner or the trembling lip of the deadly black widow were always reminded that at any moment the big guy might show up when the hulk finally does arrive he does not disappoint the hulks rage is exhilarating and terrifying to behold a green king kong also the hulks got a great sense of humor embodied by his rivalry with the only guy who can stand up to him thor whedon does an excellent job of balancing the weaker characters notably black widow and hawkeye against the superbeings who stride amongst them black widow has two scenes that demonstrate how deadly she really is even against god like beings and hawkeyes archery is unparalleled there are not one but two tracking shots in which every character struts their stuff if you go to the avengers film to see them duke it out against each other and alien monsters youve come to the right place this is going to be hard to top and oh yeah shawarma is a real food stay to the end of the credits 
 if you pre ordered this for like i did just go to the help section and set up a live chat easiest and fastest or send an email explaining that you pre ordered it for and it is now on sale for they will credit you the difference it is amazons policy on all items so dont complain this is a great blu ray it looks as good as any blu ray out there exception of baraka the d is great and will go head to head with transformers dark of the moon in terms of crystal clear special effects in bright sunny d the menu load up is great in d in fortunately have not had time to go into special features yet but for you get discs one in d and special features shouldnt necessarily hinder that decision 
this was the best marvel cinematic universe film so far so i had to have the four disc set it includes everything a fan needs blu ray d dvd digital copy and soundtrack download the blu ray special features are good but not overwhelming it has a commentary short film gag reel deleted scenes and two featurettes i highly recommend it 
while im looking forward to the dark knight rises more than any other film this year the avengers was a complete blast they combined elements from the different marvel movies and made a complete story out of it iron man thor captain america and the hulk all get their moments to shine you get your iron man vs thor and hulk vs thor fights thats just a taste of what is to come during the last thirty minutes of pure destruction the cgi is top of the line and the action scenes are really great but the movie never forgets that a good story and solid laughs are just as important as all the pretty explosions the cast led by robert downey jr full of snappy dialogue is as good as it gets the hulk is finally done right not too big and just the right amount of scary funny that he gets the two biggest laughs in the movie i even thought that the character loki was a much better and more menacing villain here than in thor its not perfect but i think it is the best marvel film to date and out of stars
with avengers marvel had a tough row to hoe starting with iron man they cranked out a series of surprisingly watchable movies including a remake of ang lees disastrous hulk related by nothing more than a shared universe of course anybody who stayed through the credits of iron man knew an avengers film was coming but how would it blend the disparate themes and directorial styles of all the entries in the marvel cinematic universe well with avengers that uncertainty is over and the results are fantastic avengers succeeds on three levels firstly it allows every hero to behave as we expect them to iron man is still a snarky always knows best alpha thor literally seems to have walked right out of his job in asgard from his own film and in the plot he has and captain america is still reeling from his jaunt through time but not enough to be scared of thousand foot drops or flapped by lokis supernatural mischief secondly avengers dumps all the characters we have come to know together in a big stew and director joss whedon uses his flair for writing arguments and comic books to deliver every bit of the conflict and comradery you would expect heroes fight team up fight some more then fight other stuff and every bit of it is punchy and fresh even black widow and hawkeye tragically underdeveloped characters who only visited in past films have good well rounded personae here and finally avengers is fun the plot loki the norse god of mischief dupes a race of alien cyborgs into invading earth because he is mad at earth is pure comic book cheese with a suitably over the top climax where the hulk really shines the dialog is clever and humorous and dark when it needs to be the effects are outstanding and a surprising amount of what you will see here is in fact sets and actors just as in captain america there are some problems the post production d for instance is horrible not because it is badly implemented but because this film makes use of a lot of creative camera perspectives that just look wrong with d applied to them in the opening chase sequence the helicopter following the convoy looks like an undersized toy due to the combination of a compressed perspective and a normal d field of depth the film is also a bit inaccessible to viewers who havent seen the preceding movies after all it wouldnt do to got through every heros origin story whenever they show up but these are minor quibbles and shouldnt get in the way of enjoying what is one of the best most satisfying comic book movies ever made and a good omen of whats to come from this franchise pros punchy writing great effects great action and tons of both good acting by principles and supporting cast alike tons of little nods to comic book fans throughout is almost three hours long goes by like the worlds best saturday morning cartooncons what the d editors did doesnt always match what the camera crew did constant acura product placement that makes gms endorsement of the transformers films seem subtle so dependent on seeing the past films and blink and youll miss it plot turns that it almost totally defies casual viewing
excellent story really well done were looking forward to the next one as far as family friendliness we think its appropriate for our year old boy and older the scary parts arent too scary the violence isnt gory and the lewdness is almost non existent language is mild with most of it coming from robert downy jr some things that stick out in my mind for clarification there is an obvious relationship between pepper and tony stark they exchange flirtatious remarks looks and contact there is one scene not giving away spoilers where loki does something pretty violent and gross a part i would consider to be the most gruesome part of the movie a parent should be able to anticipate this scene since its set up pretty clearly there are some pretty ugly aliens profanity that i can recall d n s o b again mostly by tony stark 
i have been watching dvds for years so it was with great excitment that i heard marvel was going to release their smash hit the avengers onto the digital video disc now i aint much of robert downey jr guy but i love sammy jackson and i once ate at the same restaurant at mark ruffalo i like that captain america holds up good old fashioned american values and that the hulk can be reasoned with i did not care for bill bixbys hulk very much and eric banyon and ed nortons werent much better neither scarlett johanson is not much of an actress but you dont have to be when you have a figure like that though i dont care much for her nose so i wish she would get rhinoplasty which reminds me when is the rhino going to be the villain in one of the spiderman movies if he ever is i am going to charge out and see it asap and ill probably use a credit card to pay for the ticket charge it get it i did once have a dream that thor and i got married and he let me play with his hammer and you should have seen the smile on his face 
its all been leading up to this folks the grand spectacle known as the avengers while iron man the incredible hulk iron man ii thor and captain america the first avenger all the set the stage and were great superhero films in their own respective rights none of them could really convey the sheer amount of pure awesome that the avengers contains loki tom hiddleston has returned to earth wreck havoc in his quest for the tesseract i e the cosmic cube forcing nick fury samuel l jackson to set forward his avengers initiative iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth bruce banner hulk mark ruffalo black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner unite to take down the baddies resulting in some brilliant action set pieces and massive amounts of destruction that youve got to see to believe director joss whedon best known for creating buffy the vampire slayer and firefly as well as launching marvels brilliant astonishing x men comic series manages to handle the proceedings shockingly well and equally balance for the most part sadly hawkeye seems to get the short end of the stick each character with all of them getting their own respective moments in the limelight that and mark ruffalo is an absolute smash no pun intended as banner and the hulk moments are some of the best and most insanely enjoyable segments youll see in any mainstream superhero film ever while it isnt without its flaws the avengers is a smashing blockbuster that will be extremely hard to top in terms of spectacle or action set pieces and of course like any of marvels recent films the post credits sequences set the stage for even bigger and more cataclysmic events to unfold in future installments 
one must see this if one gets any enjoyment out of the marvel universe at all this is first class enjoyment and should appeal to all ages dont dismiss it as just another comics film its solid entertainment for young and old alike 
this review is my general opinion of the movie and a response to another persons review i personally thought that the movie was amazing in every aspect the action effects and oddly enough humor this is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time my mother hated all of the other superhero movies leading up to the avengers except for iron man and she loved the avengers and to one of the people who wrote a negative review about this movie the one who said frosty the snowman was better i respect your opinion and i am sorry that you lost your brothers co workers family in but the thing is you have to understand that people are going to keep making movies with explosions in new york and that this franchise is much more than marvel trying to make a buck because if marvel was trying to make a buck they would not be making a movie that cost to make plus movies before that also the avengers is the rd highest grossing film of all time and the fastest movie to reach the milestone in the u s which by the way was days in this review if you are even reading it is not to offend you or upset you and i am deeply sorry for your loss and mean no disrespect by this review reply this was just for the purpose of explaining to you that this was not to make a quick buck and that it was a very successful entertaining and overall excellent movie i do respect your opinion you are entitled to think what you want and this is what i thought i would have made this a comment on your review but my phone would only let me do reviews to the people reading this as a review i simply think that everybody even the people who dont like superhero movies should see this movie at least once and see what they think 
ive always preferred the marvel superheroes to the dc crew for one important reason character development marvels heroes arent just one dimensional superheroes theyre fully developed characters people with personalities and histories and lives outside their hero personas whether its the wisecracking playboy genius tony stark aka iron man whos grown up believing his father didnt love him the arrogant prince of asgard thor whose father odin sent him into exile to teach him a lesson and led him to love the people of earth enough to become their protector the troubled bruce banner whose inner demons appear in the form of the angry green giant hulk captain america steve rogers who emerged from a year coma to find adjusting to his new life in the twenty first century difficult enough without the added pressures of war or the two elite assassins black widow natasha romanov and hawkeye clint barton who want to atone for the blood on their hands each character has impressive depth in the avengers the s h i e l d team has been working on harnessing the power of the cosmic cube now known as the tesseract they inadvertently open a portal that allows thors adopted brother loki until now presumed dead to enter the shield complex and take possession of dr eric selvig and hawkeye physically and mentally and launch an attack on the earth loki is a king without a kingdom and he plans to make the people of earth bow to his will hes quickly captured but as hes being transported to his prison a storm erupts his reaction surprises captain america who asks if hes afraid of a little thunder im not fond of what comes after he grumbles what comes after is his brother the god of thunder who has come from asgard to take him home to face justice there this results in a heated battle literally between thor and iron man loki escapes and the avengers a team of superheroes who dont even like each other except for black widow and hawkeye who i suspect have more than a working relationship must learn to work together to save the earth will they ever become friends the obligatory after end credits scene might offer a clue im fighting the urge to go into detail here there are so many great scenes including the death of a long standing character but i dont want to be accused of being a spoiler screenwriter director joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer angel firefly and serenity gives the avengers the perfect balance of heart humor and nonstop action the special effects are amazing but dont detract from whats most important in this film the actors robert downey jr chris hemsworth chris evans scarlett johansson jeremy renner mark ruffalo tom hiddleston cobie smulders clark gregg and samuel l jackson are all perfect for their roles as mark ruffalo dr bruce banner said in an interview there are a hundred reasons why this movie shouldnt have worked but it does does it ever theres something in the avengers for everyone and i cant recommend it strongly enough 
ive been kicked on my butt with iron man my fav hero since im a kid so far shame they did so many hulk versions but this one appears to be complete we have a new hero sending arrows like he was daredevil without watching the movie follows well thor and captain america both excellent movies we havent seen yet wolverine that might appears in the next movie who was just asked by iron man to participate whoever is on the team this is a stunning movie that blows me with such effects as d and simply with the whole story im not keen with the end too close with the end of transformers where they destroy the whole city but it is just an awesome feeling and the result of an accomplished dream with the new technology that makes me jealous about all that work done i wish i could just do a half of it ill certainly watch it again in the theater before i get the disc enough one of the best movie and iron man still beeing the greatest of all to me cos the effects and so closed shining metallic realistic view every comic fan should have this in his collection well done
ive read several of the reviews on this movie and while some nail it others just make no sense ww says that he liked the spiderman and batman franchises but stated he didnt like the avengers as it was nothing but a cash cow really ww are you saying that spiderman iii was made to better the franchise and wasnt a cash cow all of the movies you mentioned are cash cows and pretty good entertainment the avengers surpassed my expectations like no other movie ever has i had watched all the movies prior to the avengers and was critical of a few of them i thought captain america felt rushed and only created to move the franchise towards the avengers movie iron man was ok but not as good as the first i happen to be very critical of movies and it drives my wife nuts im a penny pincher and will never go see a movie at the theater unless i think its worthy i happened to go to this movie twice in the theater and loved it even more the nd time around hands down the best superhero flik ive ever seen it surpassed the batman and spidey franchises and left me speechless and grinning ear to ear even now i will watch the trailer with my year old and get chills cant wait to watch it with him in the comfort of our own home september th im buying the movie for myself and my sister for her birthday she asked for it and shes not even a superhero movie fan thank you joss whedon for creating a movie with wonderful entertainment value dont get me wrong the movie was much more than just entertainment it was great writing great balance between characters great humor and just a little character development although none was needed since we had all the prequels joss is my hero cant wait for phase ii 
its already released here in oz for the past few days and have to say of all the live action d films presently excluding documentaries the full potential of d technology was used to great effect on this film it really will blow your mind the story is an absolute ripper all thanks to the genius of joss whedon his wit and humor and also trademark killing off unexpected important and well loved character s agent phil coulson played by actor clark gregg is quite known during the buffy angel firefly era the feature film is an absolute legend although sadly even with the amount of special features included on the d blu ray disc it is quite lacking in content but then you have to think hey the hulk iron man captain america thor and even black widow and nick fury already had heaps of special feature interviews and the like done in every one of those dvd blu ray discs fans just need to collect them to see it all 
i am a huge fan of the christopher nolan dark knight trilogy but nowhere is it written that all legends have to be dark paths to redemption sometimes the greatest myths and legends are simply the kind of tales that demand to be re told generation after generation joss whedons avengers ascends the icy slopes of the superhero olympus and lays claim to that pinnacle and its throne there are layers of earthbound and extraterrestrial treachery threatening the human race but their potential saviors often distracted and hilariously by a variety of rivalries that run the gamut from sibling to battle of the sexes all the way to my hammers bigger than yours what makes this cocktail really fizz are the expert proportions poured by director whedon the cold calculations of hawkeye and black widow duplicity of nick fury and loki the stalwart heroisms of captain america and thor wild card unpredictability that is the hulk and the champagne patter of iron man make for a highly addictive and intoxicating mix the talented cast rises to the the challeng of a witty juggernaut script and the final elements of eye tickling effects and a rousing score are what all combine to earn my very rare perfect star score its a rare movie that makes me feel absolutely satisfied at the end while immediately yearning for the next adventure the avengers is truly the stuff of legends 
this review is for those interested in the d for avengers d avengers d the d in avengers d is good overall and generally has the best d moments in the final epic action sequence where the d usually on par with captain america d steps up the depth parallax d layers and pop out moments closer to the strong d level if you are a d fan this one is worth a purchase for the d d highlights all of the avengers combined their powers to take down the enemy by the final act with each d shot looking great in d featuring iron man jetting past buildings thor slamming his d hammer into the back of a soaring beast captain america tossing his shield into the screen towards the enemy foot soldiers the hulk smashing rock into rubble as it flies out at the screen and plenty more d worthy moments including loki jeremy renner and scarlett johannsen in d kicking butt does the d enhance the movie if you want an extra dimension with characters like thor or iron man standing out apart from the background as though you were almost seeing them in real life then this is the closest youll get for now would it have been better if it was filmed in d instead of post converted from a d source if done right yes but what is here is done really well d overall not an average better than average but there is room to increase the d power in the sequel d parallax layers good but great by the lenghty end battle d depth you can see deep into the screen generally d volume characters look generally lifelike with depth to their features d pop out the pop out moments by the end are nice d consistency the end really stood out strongly the rest was good d highlights the end battle throughout the outer space stairs d strength similar to captain america d thor d not as strong as avatar d which was mostly filmed in d the others converted from d d worth a buy yes recommended in d if you have a d tv dont miss it quick movie review with plenty of great action moments throughout avengers is one of the best action movies ive seen in years thanks to one of the most epic action packed and incredible ending battle scenes gracefully combining all of the current avengers working together to take down the overwhelming enemy under lokis command the best thing about avengers despite a slow build up is the well done balancing of showcasing each lead hero offering them plenty of time in the spot light to feel like they each contributed a very important role to the movie this is how to do it rating for the movie awesome 
cant wait for the next one to come out i just hope it keeps in line with the rest of the story lines 
finally a superhero movie thats an unapologetic reproduction of the story you would see in a real comic book all the same cheesy dialogue and witty one liners we would see in a comic overlaid above a surprisingly well written and intelligent story on a very large scale this is what you may have missed if you arent into comics or set them aside with your youth there is nothing anyone could say is bad about this movie it is well done in every way superbly acted visually stunning and a lot of good old fashioned fun the sets are highly detailed the visual effects are outstanding and the story moves without pause to a climax that you would not see coming if you havent already heard about it lots of action lots of laughs lots of awesome visuals lots of fun for the young and young at heart must see 
i know there has been some criticism of this film that it was too childish boring silly or ridiculous everyone ofcourse is entitled to their opinion having said that i think the movie started off a bit slow in certain areas but eventually it did live up to the action did i think it was the best film ever to be honest i cant really say at this point i thought it was alright definitely not boring by any means all the super heroes did an excellent job in all respects therefore i am giving it stars i just didnt care for samuel l jacksons role in this film perhaps they could have chosen someone else i hope you watched the credits at the end which includes some additional footage as far as the bluray is concerned for sound and picture quality minor spoiler below please do not read if you havent seen this movie in my opinion it was iron man that actually saved the day in the end the other super heroes played their part well but iron man put a stop to all the violence by taking the missile to the mothership 
my inner child is something i value most and that inner child remembers my days of being a little kid and playing with my iron man and captain america toys as well as wishing i was the incredible hulk i also remember watching the hulk cartoons and begging my parents to get me the latest issue of of the next captain america comic books so as you can tell im a comic books have played a huge role in my childhood and that being said it was with great excitement that i awaited the avengers having seen all the avengers movies until then and owning them all on blu ray i remember even watching them all up until thursday may rd which was when the midnight premiere took place my buddy and i even wore iron man masks to the screening im most happy to report to say the avengers did not disappoint is an unforgivable understatement it may just be the best comic book movie ive ever seen it shines dozens of lamps on the dark knight and it makes the previous avengers movies even thor which i loved despite not having been familiar with the thor mythos before seeing it look like the fantastic four movies everything about this movie was pitch perfect starting with the script joss whedon had penned the script and its obvious he has done his homework on not just the mythos and everything else in the world of the avengers but also what the audience loves about the heroes and expects from a movie about the avengers everyone was given a sense of humour and played their cards right tony stark was his usual lovable jerk self and had his typical attitude problems that were hard not to love he was given a great amount of action as well and the scene near the end where he pushes the nuclear bomb into the portal was purely beautiful intensity captain america was his usual kickass self and every one of his action scenes were hard to not love thor was hilarious as well and his scenes with loki were just amazing particularly the scene near the end on stark tower where he forces loki to watch the mayhem going on in the city and asks is this what you want aso finally the hulk has had justice done hes given a sense of humour which the other movies absolutely failed on im happy to report the movie did not fail there and who can forget the dialogue classic avengers dialogs down to the last inch we need a plan of attack i have a plan attack and whts the matter not fond of thunder and lightning i dont like what comes after the characterization is really what counts here too obviously if youre going to a movie called the avengers for a character study youre going to the wrong movie and you need to lay off the artsy movies too as theyre clearly doing serious stuff to your brain but for the type of movie it is its done supremely well each character is unique in their own right ive already mentioned the eponymous superheroes but black widow is one sexy and fun character thats hard not to love her action scenes are just incredible and her backstory while thankfully kept to a minimum is interesting as hell hawkeye is stone cold and scary in the first half when possessed by loki then is cool and badass near the end when he resides to kick some loki butt the movie is also one of the funniest movies ive ever seen thanks to lots of clever whedonian humour and appropriately placed comic book style exaggeration the scene where hulk smashes loki around like a rag doll made me laugh harder than anything in jump street and any other comedy this year and the scene where hulk sucker punches thor the performances are amazing as well pure commitment from all involved with downey jr evans and hemsworth as well as johannson smulders jackson hiddleston and renner giving amazing performances all but ruffalo is the real surprise here he brought something new to the table here as hulk every line he spoke sounded like he was trying hard to hold back his inner monster and boy was it chilling his monologue about how he tried committing suicide was delivered very chillingly beautifully he was the biggest surprise and got everything about the hulk perfect props to ruffalo for finally getting the hulk exactly right im going to conclude my review with one more little piece of praise whedon is my favourite tv writer and hes managed to make me proud to be a comic book nerd justice was done to the best superheroes ever and i can tell superhero movies are going to not be the same ever again a big thanks to ll involved for the commitment and true dedication to making ths movie possible and the great success it was ive seen this movie twice already and i cant wait to see it again and again now ive only got two more words to say avengers assemble 
hollywood did an amazing job with this movie even those who arent into marvel and superheroes will enjoy it they took time to develop the characters in case you hadnt seen the earlier solo movies my only complaint is that they didnt have hawkeye included as much as i would have liked but other than that they had great visuals so awesome action scenes and lots of humor can you say tony stark d it was surprisingly clean i was very impressed out of all the marvel movies this is the best now i just hope they come out with a solo movie for hawkeye and black widow ill be looking forward to seeing captain america thor iron man and avengers all of which they are coming out with if you didnt already know that heres some statistics from they made million in just three days to become the biggest opening weekend of all time before it had been in theaters even a week globally it had produced over million here are the dates for the future marvel movies cant wait captain america april thor november iron man may avengers already in development expect to see in a theater near you sometime in the no so far off future black widow and hawkeye solo movies also expected to come soon be sure to watch it all the way through the credits very important unfortunately i did not youtube saved me to sum there is some brief mild language violent content action packed very exciting impossible to feel sleepy or bored when watching the avengers a must see so what are you waiting for its definitely the best movie of the year so far imo but of course they havent come out with the hobbit yet 
the avengers does everything you want a movie to do entertain for each second were watching each super hero stays true to their character and watching the hulk have a fit is just so much fun the plot is good as far as aliens are attacking us again can be but even tony stark takes a little poke at the plot and so all is forgiven brilliant acting great cg wonderful script yes i would recommend this to anyone who ever wanted to see a good flick 
earths mightiest heroes unite in the crowd pleasing superhero blockbuster the avengers the rogue asgardian loki tom hiddleston has stolen the tessaract cube and plans to use its limitless power to launch a massive invasion upon the world and subjugate all mankind in response to this imminent threat nick fury samuel l jackson director of s h i e l d reactivates the avenger initiative that brings together tony stark iron man robert downey jr steve rogers captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth and bruce banner the hulk mark ruffalo the avengers is a rousing action packed summer movie that lives up to its tremendous hype director joss whedon serenity manages to create a well structured thrill ride with enough fanboy enthusiasm to make it one of the most entertaining comic book movies to ever hit the big screen the avengers delivers some spectacular visual effects and great action scenes that culminates to a thrilling battle sequence on and above the streets of new york city the all star cast also includes scarlett johanson jeremy renner clark gregg cobbie smulders and stellan skarsgard if you were worried that the blu ray release of the avengers wouldnt live up to your expectation the youll be pleased that this is a must have for your blu ray collection the superhero blockbuster is presented in widescreen format the hd transfer is wonderfully detailed and sharp and its dts hd master audio delivers an astounding home theater experience its special features includes an audio commentary by director joss whedon the video short item a minute gag reel minutes of deleted end extended scenes behind the scene featurettes a visual journey assembling the ultimate team and the soundgarden music video live to rise overall the avengers scores a highly recommended a 
saw this when it came out and i was pleased as usual the action great the story great and it was a great mixture of comedy at just the right time it did take a bit for everything to come together but it all worked out and became an exciting film will definitely be getting this on blu ray 
 and what fun it is spoilers ahead marvels the avengers is an expertly crafted movie that makes hours fly by like well i dont really know something fast my thoughts on seeing this movie the first time yes you will go to see this more than once were this was just as good as the dark knight how is that even possible well consider first that marvel has always had the best storylines and the know how to mix all of their characters comic books together into one all encompassing storyline then consider they decided to apply said formula to their movies third they went out and expertly casted the parts how could this not be good who else but robert downey jr could be a multi billionaire techno wizard armor wearing snark artist acts like he doesnt care but is willing to sacrifice his life to save new york chris evans is captain america a s guy living in the present day brings a little old fashioned to the role and shows old fashionedness isnt cheesy it just depends on how it is presented it is presented very well with evans being the heart and soul not to mention team leader of the avengers by the way love the shot at the movies end of him on his motorcycle riding off into the sunset mark ruffalo great casting here now i feel the hulk movie franchise finally has hope channels bill bixby in his performance good idea but adds a hulk sized portion of world weariness to his character his over the shoulder im always angry is one of my favorite moments in an entire movie of favorite moments and the hulk gets two more hulk sized moments that totally bring the house down oh nice touch having lou ferrigno voice the hulk chris hemsworth as thor is the only character in the movie whom i feel was under utilized no fault of the actors he does a great job with what he is given and does have his moments hes adopted i just felt they didnt give him as much as they did the other three leads rounding out the avengers are scarlett johansson and jeremy renner as the assassin couple black widow natasha romanoff and hawkeye ms johansson is a master interrogator albeit by making use of quite unorthodox means hawkeye is the steely cool expert marksman i had my doubts as to how an archer could work in such a high energy movie it works the avengers are put together by shield samuel l jackson as nick fury need i say more clark gregg agent phil coulson and very funny in the role colbie smulders agent maria hill doesnt get nearly enough screen time and stellan starsgard loki is portrayed by tom hiddleston whom for a character thinking of himself as a god brings some amusing vunerability to the character his embarrassment at being unable to kill brainwash tony stark this usually works or if its all the same to you ill have that drink now i was initially skeptical about this movie i didnt think loki was the best choice for a screen villain er was i wrong this tale of an immortal meglomaniac demigod god wannabe who enlists an alien race to help him conquer earth question if loki really was a god why would he need alien help made for some great popcorn big tent summer viewing my other initial fear was that this wasnt going to be the avengers as much as it would be iron man and friends thankfully i was wrong again to sum up the avengers is cinematic excellence many have complained about it being too long and the first minutes or so setting up the story do take a moment but once marvels the avengers splashes across the screen the movie takes off and never looks back it is packed with great moments and memorable lines one liners the action sequences are the best ive ever seen and it all looks real seems i read somewhere online the battle in new york would have done in reality billion dollars worth of damage you will believe it oh one last thing sit through all of the credits thank you joss whedon and co please go all out on the blu ray release please quotesnatasha id sit this one out cap captain america i dont see how i can natasha these guys thor and loki come from legend theyre basically gods cap theres only one god maam and im pretty sure he isnt dressed like that cap dr banner now might be a good time for you to get angry dr banner thats my secret captain looks back over his shoulder at cap im always angry loki embarrassed this usually works tony stark well you know performance issues the avengers pg for language non

i have not watched the dvd that came with this yet but the blu ray and d blu ray are great and play without issue i bought this version because i have a tv that does d and it is only the second d title that i have purchased the first was just because i could bought it at the same time as my tv this one was just because it was the avengers so why not as for the complaints of most the information about whats included on the dvd and blu ray discs is available so is it really anyone elses fault that they didnt get what they wanted out of the product they bought as for the people with problems playing it its more common for it to be a problem with their hardware or a dirty disc i dont have a top of the line blu ray player but i also know not to expect the same results from a cheap one as a more expensive one theyre not there yet you can get a cheap dvd player that works fine you still cant really get a cheap blu ray player that works fine its unfortunate but its true the same can be said for early adopters people who have had blu ray players for years where subtle differences that have evolved as the technology matured have had to watch their expensive players age out already but thats the price of being an early adopter 
love love love this movie all my favorite marvel heroes assembled in one place hell yes the blu ray presentation looks and sounds amazing i havent had time to go through all the bonus materials but it appears theres plenty to keep a nerd like myself occupied 
assemblagethere have been many reviews written about the avengers the latest marvel comics disney film for s first summer blockbuster the film is really a sequel to several other films and though the film does a good job of catching up the audience really seeing the other films first would really help hulk captain america iron man and thor the film is part science fiction alien invasion part team making part knock down drag out fights with thor captain america iron man and hulk beating each other up and the non powered characters with issues of their own black widow who fakes being helpless to gather intel and hawkeye who has worked with b w on many occasions this part of the film was a weakness there was not enough expository reveal regarding their relationship minor quibble the best part of the film really is the writing ive always liked josh whedons television programming from buffy to angel to firefly to dollhouse the snappy writing and silly banter was real not forced the characters were real too captain america a man out of time i saw the first film and clearly avengers was a sequel to cap what happened after the big freeze whats his relationship with nick fury and shield thor his film ended with a jane foster crush and a beat down by a very large villain as well as an apparent loss into space by loki again a sequel of sorts thor as i have imagined him he is torn between a brother who kills indiscriminately thor lokis my brother widow hes killed people thor hes adopted and has the sly deceptive character that the actor brings out so well philosophy yeah always some of that loki prefers to think of freedom as an aberration that mankind was made to be ruled by strong rulers and gods great scene of an old man no doubt a holocaust survivor at the stuttgart germany orchestra scene where the man stands up against loki and cap makes an appearance makes a speech alluding to the nazis before beating up on loki heroes and villains as with other marvel characters you have to have some heroes with something to hide some inner agenda shield has secrets no spoilers and cap and the rest smell something bad hulk bruce banner we enter his life in a similar way to the second hulk movie hiding out in a foreign country getting waylaid to help and ends up hulking out a lot of the second half is a hulk thor fest that is really fun to watch scripts the writing is very much marvel you really get the feeling that stan lee wrote it the avengers are planning out their next move as the alien invasion is in progress captain america is calling the shots he turns to hulk and says hulk smash hulk big grin rarrh great scene bottom line i could go on and on about the great effects great development and characterization fast paced action the film had a proper balance of effects fan style gimmees and enough humor to entice a wider audience much better than thor ironman or hulk and captain america first avenger for sure and i loved those films tip there are two after credit scenes learn the true meaning of shawarma cast robert downey jr tony stark iron manchris evans steve rogers captain americamark ruffalo bruce banner the hulkchris hemsworth thorscarlett johansson natasha romanoff black widowjeremy renner clint barton hawkeyetom hiddleston loki
what could be better than a movie about a bunch of your favorite marvel movie heroes played by some of your favorite movie actors answer not much it really doesnt get much better than this for fans that have been waiting for a film adaptation to finally bring the avengers together everything about the avengers movie was excellent from the cool unique story that writer zak penn and director joss whedon came up with to the devoted way the cast portrayed the characters just brilliant the avengers kind of picks up where the thor movie ended nick fury brings together iron man captain america the hulk thor black widow and hawkeye to stop loki thors brother from opening a portal that would allow beings from an alternate universe in to destroy earth what ensues is an awesome looking action packed movie thats pretty long but goes by very quickly even the dialogue especially scenes with tony stark is as witty and entertaining as anything that ive heard in any movie that ive seen in recent history the modern dynamic of the character personalities and how they interact with one another take this film to a new level for a superhero movie dramatic emotional and sometimes spot on hilarious man i am still cracking up over one of the scenes that featured the hulk and loki having a discussion we may take for granted that we live in a time when the cgi has practically been perfected in order to really make a spectacular movie the cgi in the avengers is masterful it will be many many years from now before we might ever giggle at the cgi in this movie the way we do at some of the older and even more current cgi efforts in closing i will say that every fan of the individual movies made with the avengers superheroes knows that there was always an after credits scene that hinted at events to come and the avengers does not break that tradition but wow if the ambitious implication of the after credits scene in the avengers ever has a hope of coming to true fruition it may take an unprecedented unification of movie studios avengers comic book readers know that the avengers team is not limited to the superheroes included in the movie and unless i was seeing something that i really wasnt seeing in the avengers after credit scene the story it implicatedincludes superheroes that are attached by rights to a few different movie studios so i hope that whedon didnt overpromise something that really cant be delivered anyway there is no question here add the avengers to your cart its a blu ray preorder for me the avengers is a classic superhero movie and will be on the top shelf in my collection 
so purchased this movie for my husband who is a dc and marvel comics fanatic i couldnt get him to go to the theater to watch didnt want to spend the money i pre ordered and recied it exactly when promised i sat down to watch with him just to be together after a long week at work received unopened new it is a great movie action paced of course comedy we picked one upfor our grandson for his birthday also he had already seen it in the theatre but was so excited to see it again he is yr old it would probalby help to watch thor before watching this one there were a few other references i didnt understand but wed pause the movie hubby would explain and go on but really did nt take from the experience we have watched it xs and loaned to a family member who also has watched it xs enjoy 
this movie is the best superhero film of the year and maybe the best one so far it is brillant how they tied all the other marvel superhero films iron man captain america thor the hulk and connected them into this movie the story line was good the special effect were done well the movie works 
my husband and i agreed to watch the avengers due to previous good experiences with watching both ironman films captain america from last year and thor in my opinion robert downey jr chris hemsworth and chris evans all gave strong and convincing performances in their roles as ironman captain america and thor it was also entertaining watching scarlet johanssons natasha romanoff character holding her own when confronting mark ruffalos dr bruce character my husbands favorite character was that of loki played by tom hiddleston i can understand this because hiddleston plays a powerful and complex being who proves to be a strong challenge for thor for me it is a tie between downeys ironman character and samuel l jacksons nick fury persona downey plays the role of being the braintrust in deciding how to defeat loki meanwhile jackson projects strong leadership and encouraging skills when gathering the appropriate forces to battle loki the avengers is best for anyone who has enjoyed any of the previous films captain america thor and either of the ironman films 
many of you younger people out there and those of you who didnt collect comics in your youth dont remember when stan lee got up on his soap box i believe this was back in and he promised us that he was going to be creating some movies for the people that were fans of marvel comics he promised us an x men movie he promised us a silver surfer movie he promised us a sub mariner movie he promised us a spider man movie he promised us an iron man movie he promised us an incredible hulk movie he promised us a fantastic four movie he promised us a conan the barbarian movie he promised us a captain america movie and he promised us an avengers movie being a small child at the time i was about ten years old when he made this announcement i didnt realize how complicated and expensive it could be to make a movie i assumed that all of these movies would be up on the big screen within a year or two i certainly didnt realize that it could take over three decades for a movie to come out and yet despite the long wait i think that this movie was worth waiting for back in the s we wouldnt have had awesome special effects costumes props sets and other eye candy that we have in this movie back in the s we wouldnt have had this absolutely breathtaking rendition of the s h i e l d helicarrier back in the s they wouldnt have been able to create the astounding set of combat armor that iron man wears in the movie back in the s we wouldnt have had this visually impressive cgi hulk either back in the s an alien invasion fleet trashing new york city wouldnt have looked anywhere near this cool or visually impressive and lets be honest who would they have gotten to play nick fury iron man and the black widow back in the s certainly not samuel jackson robert downey jr and scarlett johansson and perhaps the biggest tragedy of all would have been the fact that joss whedon wouldnt have been able to direct im a big fan of josss work on buffy the vampire slayer and firefly and i was thrilled to hear hed be directing this movie hes a great director with great ideas and his direction and influence took a movie that could have been awkward and conflicted and blended in the different characters plot points heroes and dramatic moments seamlessly and the comedy added into this movie was classic joss many of tony starks line were hilarious so was the way black widow interrogated the russian arms dealers at the beginning of the movie as was stan lees line at the end of the movie i highly recommend this movie to any comic book fan i highly recommend it to any joss whedon fan i highly recommend it to any robert downey jr fan any scarlett johansson fan any samuel jackson fan or pretty much anybody with a pulse 
now as far as the movie itself goes i personally thought this was the best of the summer it had everything that would make a superhero movie right action adventure story comedy etc i am aware that there are many nolan nut huggers out there that purposely try retaliate by coming onto avengers forums and discussion boards just to start some kind of rivalry that fairly pointless and inane dont get me wrong as much as i like nolans work this review is not for people who are clearly set on trying to prove that the batman series is better as far as summer blockbusters go there is plenty of stiff competition to be had competing with the the well respected batman series directed by nolan as well as the newly revamped spiderman is no easy task assembling a cast like this with big name stars has been done many times a lot of them fail this one surely does not you would think that each star would want his her share of the limelight but this movie interweaves the story so intricately that the character interactions are seamless there were scenes where i was so absorbed in the story that i didnt blink the story may not be most original but who cares it was highly enjoyable and the story was coherent the dialogue between characters were very believable because not everyone gets along with everybody people clash in personalities and it is reflected in the assembling of the avengers it is working toward a common goal that brings them to work together as a single unit and process they go through is nothing short of magical i highly recommend this movie and would hope people can put aside their preconceived notions to give this a try i will be getting the blu ray 
hands down the best superhero movie ever made smart fun and packed with great special effects all of the actors are so great in this i loved mark ruffalo as the hulk perfect casting all around the script is just perfect such smart writing joss whedon did an amazing job as directer and writer of this film i hope he comes back for the second 
what can i say my yr old and i saw it in the movies and of course we wanted to see it again i liked the extras too 
this was a allout action pack funny at times movie if your in to this stuff this is one for your collection 
this is the film we knew was coming before they even started to make it the frequent cameo appearances by nick fury samuel l jackson in all the films hinted at the coming of this film they goofed and didnt introduce fury in the first iron man unless you watched post credits and forced us to sit through a cliche filled second one so they could fit in jackson and the black widow scarlett johansson loki with ancient knowledge and a new purpose has returned the door opens from both sides and absconds with the tesseract a device of unlimited power loki is bent upon world destruction domination nick fury and the black widow travel the world to assemble a crack team of superheroes to save the planet it is during this time we get a brief re introduction of the characters the hulk mark ruffalo iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner introduced in thor and thor chris hemsworth thor comes in later he sees the loki issue as a family problem and doesnt want the avengers butting in this creates a brief three sided fight the film also boasts some good dialouge and many decent one liners especially for those who relish a good chiamus captain america wait we have to plan our attack iron man i have a plan attack the production recreates the quirky characterizations iron man is an egomaniac hulk is the reluctant hero black widow is ever confident pepper potts gwyneth paltrow is sexy and intelligent captain america is the naive patriot lou ferrigno who else could it be is the voice of a larger hulk than in the past as expected having a villain with the strength of the gods is not enough there has to be some minor infighting due to personality differences the film includes a good blend of action comedy great special effects and has a fairly decent plot at that it does help to have seen the other films especially thor but it is not a requirement if you have some inkling of the superheroes mentioned parental guide no f bombs sex or nudity minor profanity sob 
this movie has the most amazing special effects and i love the story behind it the characters were cast to perfection and im so glad they have all been modernized for my children to enjoy 
let me start off by saying i am not a follower per say of super heroe type movies but i am a lover of spectacular films i would not have normally seen this movie but the reviews have been for the most part just wonderful well i got to see it and i must say with all the movies i have seen this year this one has turned out to be my favorite the special effects were something to behold it just moved along great and even had some humor speckeled in there is no question in my mind when there is a good sale on the d version i will as they said in one commercial a while back jump in it this one is a keeper
if you enjoyed the iron man cpt america or thor movies then you will thoroughly enjoy this one if you did not dont waste your time go watch a oscar award winning movie this isnt your cup of tea 
okay if youre on the amazon page for this movie chances are youve already seen plenty of five star reviews at this point it feels like all i can say has been said before is the movie good absolutely not only is it one of the best movies of the year but one of the best comic book movies ever made the cast is great all around the action is amazing and the movie is just simply a lot of fun it holds up as well on home video as it did in the cinemas what is there really to say beyond that the blu ray looks beautiful the picture is one of the best ive seen and i have a fairly large blu ray collection in terms of special features the commentary is insightful and often funny the gag reel has some pretty funny moments but feels a little short the one shot short film that marvel generally includes on the blu rays is pretty fun as per usual all around this is one of the most enjoyable movies of the year if you have a blu ray player and even a passing interest in comic books you owe it to yourself to pick this one up 
asgardian loki breaks in to shield headquarters uses the tesseract a cube of pure energy that can destroy the world and plans to conquer the world using it to open a portal to let an alien race called the chitauri no one on earth has the power to fight these extraterrestrials so nick fury in desperation calls in bruce banner the hulk tony stark ironman thor and steve rogers captain america to band together and stop loki however they are a volatile unruly group that simply dont get along and dont trust shields motives can they put aside their petty differences and distrust of shield long enough to save the world i was very excited to see the avengers because i enjoyed all of the films leading up to it and their characters but especially because joss whedon was directing i think this is one of the best comic book movies ive ever seen and i believe it is thanks to whedon he brought a lot of humor throughout the film even during the most heartbreaking moments i dont remember ever laughing so hard in any superhero movie there were even moments when dialogue was unintelligible because the whole audience was roaring with laughter he also fleshed out the minor characters wonderfully in the previous movies i couldnt care less about hawkeye and black widow hawkeye had a super small part in thor and did practically nothing black widow in iron man was super flat and only really there for eye candy and cool fight scenes in the avengers hawkeye is instrumental to the story and he updates the bow from a practically obsolete relic compared to guns and other firearms to something useful and dangerous his sense of loyalty and justice really made him a cool character as well as his relationship with black widow black widow is also very important to the plot she gets to show off how she is actually a good spy by playing the victim and getting those who would think themselves above her to reveal their plans she is much more than just a pretty face and we get to see how is she is underneath her strong exterior i liked that these two characters arent marginalized because they are weaker than the other super heroes they prove to be important in their own right and are allowed to actually develop as dynamic characters one of the things i was afraid of was one superhero or another dominating the movie this film masterfully balances each hero each make mistakes and look silly at one point and they also all have great shining moments of heroism they all bring something that the others dont have and make this disparate hodge podge group into a real team captain america is a great tactician who sees each persons strength and how best to utilize that strength on the battlefield iron man thinks outside the box and has incredible intelligence beyond that huge ego of his bruce banner is also extremely smart but also turns into a huge strong rage monster when he transforms thor is practically immortal with a powerful hammer the ability to fly and power over thunder and lightning these larger than life characters are lot to stuff into one movie but they end up being a well balanced powerful team the last act of the film is the giant splodey extraterrestrial battle for new york the comparisons to the transformers are cringeworthy but not complete unfounded there are a few key differences one being that the avengers is actually a good coherent movie that doesnt entirely rely on special effects another is that while the transformers movies have cool shots of buildings exploding and falling down and cgi fight scenes but the human element is lost in the avengers the people running and screaming from the attack are a focus in the middle of this battle we even follow a particular waitress as she runs from location to location and is finally saved by captain america this makes the audience care about the civilians and actually worry when buildings collapse and debris is falling everywhere the avengers is a spectacular superhero film that takes the characters we know and gives them portrays them in a much deeper way and keeps that human element in a huge epic fight i also really liked the banter between the characters the humor throughout and especially the deviously manipulative sinister loki i have seen it times so far and wouldnt mind seeing it again if you want a truly enjoyable film with action adventure aliens and superheroes the avengers is definitely for you 
i have to admit i expected the avengers to be good considering how word of mouth kept saying it was but after seeing it i would say it was one of the best movies i have ever seen joss whedon did so well they had better give him the keys to this franchise and let him do them all there is no other director that i think could have pulled off having so many headliner actors in one movie and not have it fall apart every character shared the screen so well it was shocking robert downy jr had his best performance as iron man the thing that stood out the most to me and the one thing i was worried about was mark ruffalo as the hulk no worries any more he did the best job as bruce banner compared to even bill bixby too many things to say about it but if you like action sci fi comic books or all three and you havent seen this movie go rent it sit down and prepare to be blown away worth every cent and every minute 
in the movie iron man was released the film was a major gamble it was the first of a series of movies marvel planned to release that would lead up to an eventual release of a multi hero live action adaptation of the avengers had it bombed some of the planned films in the build up might never have happened not to mention the resurrected career of robert downey jr and the avengers would never have been made thankfully the film was successful and four years later the avengers movie is a reality the tesseract cosmic cube from captain america and seen in thor is being studied by s h i e l d as a way to provide free and endless energy to the world it is also believed that the device can be used as a portal to other worlds the tesseract starts reacting strangely and then loki tom hiddleston appears he begins killing off agents one after the other with a powerful scepter he also uses the scepter to turn people into his mental slaves loki is chased by agent maria hill cobie smulders through s h i e l d s underground complex but is able to escape even though hes been ordered to disassemble the group fury begins gathering together the band of super heroes of the avengers initiative steve rogers capt america played by chris evans tony stark iron man bruce banner hulk played by mark ruffalo and voiced by lou ferrigno and natasha romanoff black widow played by scarlett johansson are all on board and are joined by thor chris hemsworth who has been sent from asgard by odin to collect his brother loki well things dont exactly go as planned well duh and loki escapes again and an invasion of earth by an extraterrestrial army begins in the middle of new york for a movie that has been planned for years and has a cast list that is truly star studded the avengers is an impressive bit of filmmaking superman ushered in the modern superhero movie and x men illustrated that a super team movie could actually be pulled off the avengers has now illustrated that you can actually make a series of very distinct yet connected superhero films then bring them all together in one massive movie and still make a highly entertaining and enjoyable film that appeals to filmmakers across the board theres something for everyone in the movie a little romance for the ladies plus several attractive men theres all kinds of references to the comics for the comic book geeks theres lots and lots and lots of action but none of it is gory there are several different layers of humor physical comedy that appeals to kids and witty one liners referencing classical works that will appeal to someone with a more intellectual humor captain america emerges as the leader of the avengers iron man tony stark get most of the best lines thor hasnt given up on seeing loki redeemed and hulk finally gets his cinematic due someone finally got the big green guy right and emerges as the real hero of the film the script does a wonderful job of explaining the techno babble of what the audience needs to know without getting bogged down in unnecessary details also since the previous movies in the avengers line up focused on introductions the film doesnt have any exposition and gets right into the action speaking of action theres a lot of it theres the opening sequence that ends up destroying one of s h i e l d s land bases theres some infighting with the heroes whats mightier thors hammer or captain americas shield and theres the climactic battle between the avengers and the invading alien army from another universe visually the film is gorgeous it has a perfect blend between fantasy and the real world i only have two criticisms about the film the first is that we really dont get an understanding of how loki got to meet the aliens that supported and financed his attempted takeover of earth the second is kind of a minor spoiler spoiler a major character apparently meets an untimely demise i realize that for the plot of the film a death seemed necessary but was it really wouldnt the escape of loki and the destruction that ensued as well as the deaths of countless other agents been enough to unite the heroes together as a team or how about one of the lesser known avengers hawkeye or black widow their death could have been just as poignant the demise appears real but because of some dialogue earlier in the movie and the reactions of a couple characters there is speculation that this was all part of a game by nick fury a life model decoy perhaps overall the avengers is a great movie its one that youll enjoy watching again and again 
since iron mans release we the fans have been eagerly awaiting the assembly of one of the greatest super hero forces in comic history not just as a treat for fans but as a pioneering film uniting various individual film stars in a union that has never been done in film it worked the avengers is such an incredible and fun film each character is given just enough time to shine and everything from the battle sequences to the jokes had perfection written all over it mark ruffalo taking edward nortons spot as bruce banner was the biggest thing for me to see because it was a pretty big role to fill it was as if norton had never been there in the first place mark ruffalo was one of the best additions to this film saga and dont get me started on how hulk was in the movie the part that i loved most about this film was the ending because you are left knowing that this story is far from finished and it is going to be bigger and better the avengers is of course going to be compared to the dark knight rises as to which was the better film there is no comparison they are two different movies but as great as dark knight was the avengers was just so much more from a pure entertainment perspective if you missed this movie on the big screen shame on you still the movie is worth getting i know i will watch it over and over again end of book 
this is a great and clean movie clean movies and without bad language is hard to find these days we need more family movies like this one 
in the reviews for this film which has at present a rating on rottentomatoes com hint that means only of reviewers that saw it didnt like it the negative ones say that paraphrasing it lacks substance or its a million toy commercial or its all flash this is america and everyone is entitled to an opinion but for the life of me i cannot understand why people think this ive been a student of film all of my life in one way or another and this film is the very definition of excellent ensemble and technical filmmaking 
 the avengers delivers on the promise of the other marvel films with a rip roaring adventure filled with snappy dialogue good performances great action sequences and terrific visual effects that supports a well written directed story from joss whedon should you see it in d the film was shot with d in mind so a number of scenes benefit from it but quite honestly it would work just as well as a regular theatrical presentation since i dont have the blu ray d i cant review that aspect but i can review the two disc blu ray dvd combo image sound a top notch blu ray transfer with deep rich blacks nice detail depth and bold colors marvels the avengers looks and sound brilliant the lossless soundtrack is audio demo quality with excellent use of the surround speakers detail and again imaging depth dialogue is always to the forefront where its needed to be subtitles are provided in english as well as providing descriptive services for the blind the special features are good but a bit disappointing in that there arent more of them covering the details i was interested in i would have loved to see a special feature on the comic book its evolution and a discussion with joss whedon as to why he chose this line up which isnt quite the original as in the original s comic book it also would have been nice to provide some of the vintage comic books in a digital format as an example of the story elements that whedon borrowed for the film including the reboot of nick fury since originally he looked nothing like samuel l jackson and was revised to look like the actor a bit of irony considering that he wasnt offered the role until a decade later we do get two fine featurettes that provide us with behind the scenes footage talking heads discussing what attracted them to the film roles whedon is as always effusive and entertaining particularly during the commentary track where he discusses the decision to shoot the film without a d rig and do a post conversion he shares his experience with shooting the tag at the end of thor in d which was added to that film to set up this film he also discusses his approach to the characters and the mission that marvel gave him in making the film deleted extended scenes are an interesting addition we get an alternate opening and closing for the film both of which involve cobie smulders character giving her a larger role in the film this footage was wisely excised in my opinion we also get footage of captain america brooding over peggy and although interesting it would have been far more interesting to see him actually go and try and meet her although they would have to figure out a way to tie it into the larger narrative spoiler there are also extended scenes including a scene between loki and hawkeye where the latter gives loki the information that sends him on his mission to disrupt the avengers that little scene explains how he knew what he was doing would break the team apart but it also would have spoiled us discovering what his true purpose was in allowing himself to be captured end of spoiler finally we get a gag reel and trailers for other films im sure there are probably easter eggs but i havent discovered them yet on the blu ray the dvd comes with one featurette and the commentary track oh and make sure to stick around post credits for an amusing scene involving the heroes doing something tony stark suggests earlier at the conclusion of the film notice that captain americas face is blocked by his hand thats because the scene was shot after completion of shooting and chris evans was growing a beard for his next role spoilers when an intergalactic threat spearheaded by loki tom hiddleston to obtain the mysterious and powerful cosmic cube a major plot point in captain america and seen briefly in thor arises agent nick fury samuel l jackson is forced to call together a dysfunction team of superheroes iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans bruce banner the hulk mark ruffalo black widow scarlet johansson hawkeye jeremy renner and later thor chris hemsworth to battle loki and get the cosmic cube back before loki can obtain his objective to open a portal for an invading alien army eventually the team gets past their dislike of each other rivalry to work as a team they may not like each other but they each have a role to play and embrace it stick around past the initial credits for a surprise cameo from a well known marvel villian named thanos if you dont know who he is look him up he appears in a number of marvel comics at various times and his character is tied to the cosmic cube so whedon does a good job of combining elements of the first issue of the avengers with later comics end of spoilers joss whedon has done a terrific job of assembling the avengers pun intended for their first big screen adventure the film is filled with strong action sequences that are both well designed and executed the continuity between the avengers and the previous marvel films captain america iron man the incredible hulk iron man and thor is well established and continued here it helps that whedon did an uncredited rewrite on captain america and even worked on ang lees much disliked hulk plus whedon is a passionate fan of the marvel comic books are there flaws well sure just about every movie has one flaw or another there are some plot coincidences holes that will bother those who are picky about that stuff but what matters here at least to me your mileage may vary is the flow and how well put together the story is you can pick apart just about any movie recommended 
totally wonderful movie for those who grew up reading marvel comics its a great introduction for those who didnt grow up with superheroes i suggest that you watch thor ironman and captain america first so that you have the backstory for these characters all excellent films when i was young id ask my dad to buy me a comic when he went out to buy a paper now most parents would have come home with mickey mouse or donald duck i however was the recipient of comics about superheroes so i grew up loving them i am so thrilled that special effects have caught up with the writers and artists imaginations they really bring the stories to life like no time in the past 
for the last few years there have been a number of marvel comics characters adapted to the big screen some of them have had their film rights taken up by other studios so despite the fondest wishes of some comics fanboys there will never be massive crossovers since however there has been a concerted effort to create a shared cinematic universe among several characters two iron man films the incredible hulk thor and captain america the first avenger have shared common links characters and references which have all led to this summers blockbuster event the avengers its been awhile but marvel studios chose the right directors for the earlier projects and carefully brought all of these together under just the right director to bring the team to life for the first time on the big screen and its paid off beautifully the film starts with nick fury samuel l jackson director of shield an intelligence and special ops agency with a near unlimited budget coming to a secure facility where trouble is brewing fury and his right hand agents phil coulson clark gregg returning again to the films and maria hill cobie smulders making her debut in the franchise learn that the tesseract a cubed energy source last seen in the first avenger is behaving erratically the scientist in charge eric selvig stellan skarsgard reprising his role from thor barely has time to brief fury when the tesseract opens a wormhole and out comes the treacherous loki tom hiddleston who was last seen falling into the void in thor loki uses mind control on selvig and shield agent clint barton aka hawkeye jeremy renner who did a cameo as the character in last years thor escaping from the facility with the tesseract fury whose plans to start a team of superhumans have stalled must assemble the group captain america chris evans is only just starting to get used to life in the current day after being in stasis for decades iron man robert downey jr is opening up a new stark tower in new york city and spending time with his assistant turned partner turned girlfriend pepper gwyneth paltrow making a cameo this time out the black widow scarlett johansson is called in from an interrogation overseas to bring in another potential team member she tracks down bruce banner mark ruffalo taking over the role from edward norton and thus becoming the third banner in three films the ang lee film doesnt count as canon in this franchise by the way and the most suitable for the role in india banner aside from being a genius whos the definitive expert in gamma radiation also happens to turn into a rampaging green sledgehammer of sheer power called the hulk when he gets mad lokis brother thor chris hemsworth arrives from asgard clashing briefly with iron man and captain america before joining in with the group he also brings the news that loki seeks to bring an alien army to earth for a full invasion to subjugate humanity once and for all as loki works to make that happen the team must bridge the differences between them get past their dysfunction and work together to save the world the movie succeeds on the basis of several elements first the dynamics between the characters is just right fitting both the comic and cinematic versions of each team member their personalities and histories are conveyed well through the screenplay and the performances both in the way they butt heads and work together i liked the way tony and bruce two intellectual geniuses sparred with each other in the lab and bickered for example and steve rogers as a man completely out of his own time feels once again true to form each of these characters are strong alpha personalities who have to find a way to work cohesively at first theyre at odds in fact through the film pretty much every member of the team gets into a fight with at least someone else on the team after a pivotal moment they become united in a common cause the casting is essential as well with the exception of ruffalo all of the leads have appeared in the earlier films and have fit their characters very well evans the soldier out of time becomes the natural leader again decisive and courageous despite the odds downey playing stark for the third time now once again gets some of the great lines not all of them with his funny acerbic take on the character pretty much irritating everyone else in the cast to some degree johansson as the widow gives us a character whose backstory is fleshed out who can use truth and subterfuge in the very same moment and who despite being a mere human is credible as the most dangerous woman alive renner spends the first part of the movie as a bit of a ghost until he gets freed from lokis control but afterwards becomes the solid marksman absolutely cool under pressure with history with the widow i liked their interaction hemsworths return as thor is more than welcome he was perfectly cast as the character in last years film and he seems as if he never stepped out of the role i liked that there are moments in the film where hes the voice of reason both with the hulk and with his brother loki hiddleston as loki once again is a compelling villain and making him the reason the avengers come together is a good nod to the comics history as well a broken and utterly desolate soul since his exile its not that much of a leap for such a man to end up becoming capable of terrible acts hiddleston conveys that quality very well indeed ruffalo as the newcomer to the franchise fits the role of banner perfectly the character has been played before by eric bana too whiny in the ang lee film but the blame for that debacle can be laid at the directors feet and edward norton who just seemed off in the role ruffalo gives us a brilliant troubled man whos all too aware of the danger his other side presents his revelation that hes tried to commit suicide is perfectly suited to who he is and yet hes a very sympathetic character both as himself and as the big green walking temper tantrum the production values of the film help things along alan silvestri who scored the first avenger returns to compose the music for this film and he gives us powerful commanding music that perfectly suits the themes of the film the cgi makeup set design and costuming involved is very well done and it really shows the avengers quinjet and the shield helicarrier are rendered well just as id imagine them to be the invading army largely cannon fodder and never before used in the comics version mostly use gliders as their invasion kicks off the final act of the film and look decidedly ugly their flight scenes have a frantic chaotic feel that looks real and their leviathans giant armoured flying creatures look gigantic and terrifying and very much in the scene as opposed to completely fake the battle between the avengers and these invaders feels very much immediate and real and thats a credit to the live action and how seamlessly it blends with the cgi elements the cgi is probably best expressed in the look of the hulk in the ang lee film the cgi for the character was inconsistent at best and the hulk often seemed over or undersized not in the picture with other characters and just generally muddled that improved greatly in the incredible hulk and is certainly well done here the hulk has consistency whenever he appears on the screen and feels very much like hes sharing space with the rest of the cast much attention to detail has been paid to getting him right and it paid off its director joss whedon who brings it all together and he was the ideal choice for helming the project whedon knows the source material very well indeed and his background suits the demands of the film this is the creative force behind firefly buffy the vampire slayer and angel after all one of his cast members from the latter two series in fact has a cameo in the film though alexis denisof is completely unrecognizable from his days as an erstwhile british watcher whedon gets group dynamics how to mold together the complex relationships and personalities into a unified whole he also has a good sense of humor and that plays itself out well throughout the film he gets the best out of his cast and crew and in the end the film is a grand slam out of the ballpark as the proverbial coach of the team whedon can take a well deserved bow in closing the film succeeds wildly in bringing these characters together the marvel universe has always had much more interesting characters then their dc counterparts after all sorry superman but youll always be a boring boy scout the film tells a story of coming together in a common cause to fight back against impossible odds to stand as one there are some extraordinary jaw dropping moments throughout the film but i think the best moments of the film are the ways that the characters interact with each other sometimes thats through dialogue other times its just a look or the way a god of mischief winds up getting six heroes really really mad at him 
lets just get this out of the way i absolutely loved the avengers and thought it to be one of the most fun entertaining superhero movies out of all superhero movies where as dark knight gave you dark gritty realistic batman avengers gives you light extraordinary superheroes now plot eh the plot is a little weak and the introduction will turn off any casual viewer i dont think it was the smartest idea to start with comic book talk of the tesseract as a fan of comics myself i could see this scene setting a bad tone for anyone who doesnt read comics also its a little bit campy and feels out of place in the movie quite honestly they could have started the film right at the base and gotten rid of these scene altogether also there are some things that still dont work for me though i tried to pay attention i still dont see why loki and hawkeye were in germany lokis plan seemed unnecessarily convoluted to work properly now yes i know arch villains are supposed to have supremely convoluted plans the problem is that when you see it in movie form it starts to feel like the only reason a happened was so that b could happen it starts to feel very contrived and forced just so that we could introduce thor or have an excuse for hulk to rampage in the helicarrier however when these events do happen they happen marvelously where as the action scenes in transformers put me to sleep the action scenes in the avengers grab my attention and dont let go to the very end the characters are well defined the movie keeps you in suspense and the massive battle in new york city does not disappoint at all it is pure unadulterated fun with funny one liners and memorable moments sure it may have its moments of campiness and if you need a strong plot or character depth to enjoy the movie you might not like this this movie appeals to comic book fans and people who love to watch a great spectacle the experience is better in the theaters but at home on your tv or computer monitor wont disappoint in short if youre feeling a little bored this movie is sure to perk you up 
ive been waiting to see this movie since i heard about it on superherohype com then i saw the movie in d with my mom and sister right before my surgery the next day and man this movie knocked our socks off it was great to see iron man thor hulk captain america black widow and hawkeye kicking ass and saving the world together the only question that i had was where was giant man ant man and wasp in this superpowered melee anyway avengers was by far the best superhero movie of all time and marvel studios is already working on avengers ant man captain america and in an unrelated note x men days of future past so dc comics and warner brothers better get a move on and start working on the justice league flash wonder woman and other dc comics superhero movies cause marvel studios is kicking their ass hard i later bought the avengers dvd from amazon for a good price which was great it will be a welcome addition to my dvd collection 
great movie with a lot and i mean lot of special effects the story is simple all superheroes are reunited to save the earth from a bunch of ugly aliens the acting is fantastic as expected and dominated by robert downey jr iron man who always cracks these one liners that are sometimes funny even hulk mark ruffalo finds a way to control himself if you can you should definitely watch the movie in d it is really well done especially towards the end when the war starts and you can see the planes practically flying over your head 
american science fiction film star trek into darkness is almost perfect director j j abrams has a super nova with this film the action and visuals are breathtaking it begins with kirk and bones running and the running never stops in this fast paced energized film its a great film the acting by its entire cast is superb the special effects are amazing and beautiful to behold i loved the soundtrack its the same as the first film and sounded great i dare to say that it will be nominated for many academy awards next year including acting by chris pine who plays james t kirk and bruce greenwood who reprises his role as captain pike but it has one big flaw that just bugs me why are the frozen superhuman villains being kept alive look at all the damage just one of them created what would happen if they all were set free they are a huge threat to humanity and other worlds kirk should have sent them all into the sun to free humanity once and for all from the threat of their evil intent i can guess that starfleet wants these superhumans blood because of its power to heal and they believe in giving john harrison a fair trial i hate story lines were something big like this is written into the script written by roberto orci and then not fully dealt with completely i hate to wait this part of the story is a hole that is left open on purpose for future sequels most likely ill bet money we will see john harrison again and if you think he was angry in this film spoiler alert dont read this paragraph if you havent watched this film yet oh and check out this theory now that starfleet has this new powerful anti death blood serum from john harrison they really need him now kirk and any of the other characters can die and be brought back to life any time they need to right very interesting star trek into darkness is a must see for all trek fans if you are new to this franchise you can catch up if you want to by watching the first original tv series on hulu star trek season one for free and the remaining seasons for a month subscription fee if you do choose to watch this entertaining wonderful series you will be able to enjoy these new films a whole lot more i highly recommend this new film star trek into darkness make sure to see it in imax d for the full awesome effect of this wonderful film enjoy release date may running time minutesrated pg for intense sequences of sci fi action and violence american science fiction action film grade a
without spoiling the big thing about the villain i cannot specify what is derivative about it except to say that several moments in the film are pretty blatantly derived from other star trek films despite this it doesnt at all interfere with the film and its storytelling as a whole save for one moment involving spocks scream near the end i couldnt not burst out laughing despite the derivations along those lines the film makes the story and characters its own as well as beautifully altering certain characters personalities based on the alternate universe events while maintaining their original star trek personalities particularly with the villain some action scenes border on the gratuitous but even in those such as the one with the klingons its purpose serves the plot in demonstrating the villain particularly when kirk starts punching him about the only thing that stood out as pointless was having carol marcus played by alice eve strip to her underwear while changing into an environment suit at the very least she told kirk to look away and the shot we get is when he looks anyway gratuitous yes but a far stretch to call it misogynistic i would certainly rate this above first contact but not sure if it reaches to the level of wrath of khan 
this is one of the few sequels ive seen that manages to be better then the original yes im even considering the original trek film in the s this movie was epic and i never understood the silly backlash over jj not letting everyone know from the start that cumberbatch was khan i personally think jj did a fantastic job here the movie is action packed and has a great plot 
must have for st fans but also for people that like exciting movies lots of action to keep you on the edge of your seat 
it seems that the universe contains a never ending supply of bad guys for the star trek crew to battle the roddenberry technique and effects are intact with this film it is highly entertaining which is the reason we go to the movies in the first place 
great visual effects and story line this movie should only be seen by watching the first star trek made in and to help with the idea of the story in this film is to watch the original star trek movies but overall i give this movie five stars 
star trek into darkness is a spectacular addition to the franchise its one of the very best star trek films and is even better than the reboot that preceded it spoilers followwhat makes it so good in the first place its action packed with great special effects which is kind of key for a summer blockbuster but that alone wont cut it with star trek fans it also has good writing and surprisingly good acting a lot of the plot is character driven as chris pines kirk and zachary quintos spock continue to take each others measure by now kirk and spock are friends but rather uneasily so the impulsive by the seat of his pants kirk finds his relationship to spock tested by spocks logical by the book approach that threatens kirks very career while quintos spock does a great job of trying ultimately without success to suppress his emotional impulsive side by the end of the movie each of them has applied and learned the value of the others approach doing a bit of a role reversal pine and quinto manage to bring some real depth to this struggle this is further accentuated by the fact that as is often the case the struggle is over matters that reflect current events do we arrest terrorists or treat them as legitimate targets of war can we cross international boundaries to get at them where do kirks and spocks real duties lie where does revenge fit in if it fits in at all the character who forces kirk and spock to wrestle with these issues partly against their will is the superb benedict cumberbatch who gives the movie franchise some of its strongest acting ever cumberbatch is bound for great things and he shows it in this role midway through the film he is revealed to be none other than khan noonien singh whom he plays with a dramatic intensity worthy of and even exceeding the performance of ricardo montalban khan is an intriguing character and cumberbatch takes him to a whole new level his schemes consisting of wheels within wheels becoming in at least one way like a sinister mirror image of kirk if kirks actions are justified by his concern for his crew then arent khans as well a disturbing thought given where khan goes with it but thats not all karl urban continues to channel deforest kellys mccoy even more successfully than in the previous film he trades the inevitable barbs with spock but most of his relational development is with regard to kirk in this film bruce greenwood gives another strong but all too brief performance as chritopher pike the rest of the enterprise crew are in fine form as well one of the nicest touches for hard core trekkies is how skillfully j j abrams and the writers have woven trek lore into the plot and in a way that mostly doesnt feel forced khans appearance is foreshadowed by events that are clearly referenced in the original series as well as star trek ii the wrath of khan carol marcus slips deftly into the story line as well providing in interesting link to the shadowy section the very mention of which warns us that all in this film will not be as it seems and the reprise of the death scene from star trek ii the wrath of khan is pulled off with great care it could have been cheesy an instance of star trek lampooning itself but the result is anything but that and in consequence we get to see the genetically engineered superman khan in a knock down flight with an enraged vulcan the only thing that felt a bit odd was a tribble as a lab rat how could you mccoy of course this isnt the original series the actors are different abramss approach is different the times are different nevertheless abrams has been true to the original in some core ways and in this film even more than the last hes set himself a high bar for further entries in the franchise well done 
this movie is a non stop action movie with good acting a decent story and it continues a great comeback for the franchise the new cast certainly has the chemistry and they are believable as the younger versions of the beloved cast i saw it in the d imax and wow that was pretty amazing bought this the moment it came out just to see the movie without all the bells and whistles and it held up for me it is just pure fun and i look forward to more gosh it the reboot the next generation who could play pichard 
just saw this in imax d today it was amazing i recommend even if youre not a sci fi fan im going to see it again in the regular theater in a few days i just pre ordered this bluray ill be back to update the bluray aspect later on in the meantime go see it 
stardate i concur that this is one of the best movie sequels i have ever seen what are the certain factors that make this film as awesome and possibly even better than the film that preceded it it could be these a gripping story featuring the characters everyone knows and loves an amazing villain portrayed by sherlock actor benedict cumberbatch a dazzling score a great twist ending that ties to the original series of films that preceded this reboot series overall score stars highly recommended 
i confess i rarely consider the extras in a movie review unless they are essential to understanding the film or they are a major addition to the cost such as with disk lotr sets or disk avatar sets on this single dvd the value stands and falls on the value of the film i have never been a rabid fan of star trek especially the movies since i believe they are relatively weak when compared to their closest competitors the star wars series but this film may be the very best effort so far to attain a level comparable to star wars lets say star wars ii attack of the clones i think one of the very best reasons for that is in the quality of the competition the fabulously talented khan noonien singh who first appears in the original star trek series in and again in the second star trek movie the wrath of khan the moral here may be never let a good villain go to waste khans virtue is probably based on both the screenwriters script for his dialogue plus the delightfully sinister characterization by my favorite actor benedict cumberbatch who is having a very good year in film cumberbatch plays it very very cool khan is an unknown quantity to the young kirk and spock which is why spock somehow consults an older version of himselfit annoyed me that the technique by which he did that is not explained but that is one of the difficulties of fast action movies there is no time to fit in the glue that fits things together even the greatest sci fi flicks have that problem such as and avatar the advantage you have over the characters in the story is that you know all about khan long before kirk and spock do and like so many action sci fi movies there are many deus ex machina rescues which pull the bacon out of the fire just in time and there are an equal number of whatever the opposite is of deus ex machina that is dangers especially late in the film for which no groundwork has been laid its as if the writer says these guys are getting off too easily we need to throw another monkey wrench into the works too much of that and we have just action for the sake of action but i confess this film carries it off with a great amount of eacute lan we feel sympathetic for at least a few of the characters such as kirk spock scotty sulu and admiral pike and cumberbatch pulls off a really believable cold but remarkably calculating character who can appear to be sympathetic and on you side when it suits his purpose 
remember the original tv series remember botany bay remember space seed well this is a new time line but an old story comes to life with some fun twists a solid send up after angering many purists with the first chris pine commanded enterprise some were hoping to see the changes undone in this sequel but that wont be happening and probably all for the best plenty of entertainment value here and into the b old future this cast is perfect and this extension of the classic series is here to stay 
first of all i think the people who gave this movie star have the right to voice their opinions but to say that it was garbage and that jj abrhams cant direct is just wrong i loved it i even compared it with the original which was wonderful but im probably the only one i dont know about others who thought this star trek sequel was better than the original star trek ii before everyone jumps on me let me explain with star trek ii the wrath of khan you had to know who khan is and how he came to hate kirk and for people to know khan you need to go back to the original series episode space seed in into darkness the whole khan thing is explained in the movie and plus the acting is not too overly done and no one person is on the screen for more than they need to be i really recommend this for anyone although i do recommend seeing the star trek first to get to know the new crew 
i really like these newer star trek movies they picked a great cast for the villain in this one they pick none other then benedict cumberbatch he is cast as sherlock holmes in the british show sherlock great actor this one won me over i saw it in the theater and had to buy it get it you will enjoy it 
i am a fan of the original movies and series i like tng but i love the reboot that abrams started in the new actors are completely believable as the original enterprise crew and i love that we get to see them when theyre younger this movie has everything you want in star trek humor some great comedy moments between spock kirk and mccoy and the actors keep all of the mannerisms we associate with these characters made famous by the original actors a little romance yes uhura and spock are still dating lots and lots of action but not mindless action every scene in this movie has a purpose a nice twist at the end but i think it added to the character development and no i wont spoil it you really get to see the relationship between kirk and spock grow another thing i love about this movie is we see kirk develop into the captain we are familiar with and was made famous by william shatner kirk is still new to the captains chair and is a bit reckless which gets him into trouble with starfleet however when sent on a secret mission he soon finds that he has been pulled into a web of lies and deceit in order to save his crew and a bunch of innocent people kirk soon learns what it truly means to be captain of a ship something pike had been trying to teach him and he discovers how much he is willing to sacrifice to save his crew so dont believe the negative reviews this is a great movie and has everything you want in a star trek film it moves right along not a single boring moment and it ties a lot of holes that were left by the original series and movies as in you see the character develop into the ones we love but it also brings us right up to their five year mission which is where the series began anyway go to it youll be glad you did 
i love all the star trek movies and this was no exception i think its great how they mix traditional star trek and new together wonderful 
is there anything j j abrams cant turn into gold after the visionary tv masterpiecelostand other hits the star trek franchise is his latest to be touched by his midas finger and soon it will bestar wars after that acloverfieldsequel a few video game reboots half lifeand ohmygod portal and then hes a producer of star trek andmission impossibleand who knows what else the mans a genius star trek into darkness is terrific it maintains the integrity of the characters is true to the ideals of the franchise and besides all that it is a great movie i thought it hit on all cylinders even some hokey ones which any true fan knows are all part of the star trek persona in fact this new alternate universe star trek is really doing a great job of keeping up with the traditions of the old series treating the parallels with both reverence and at times playfulness i applaud the decision to shoot it in imax every shot in this movie is crisp and lush and big stid is visually so immediate it feels like it takes place in your veins even the sounds are intense in our showing one nearby gentleman stood up during the credits and bellowed to the audience did anyone else think this was too loud and no one answered him i certainly didnt though yes it was loud it was so alive and urgent that i felt i was sharing their atmosphere so much is done to give the movie an amazing sense of presence as if abrams truly understands the reverence that even scientists love to trek for instance whenever warp drive is achieved the ship has that familiar e long a tion that a la einsteins theory stretches it just before it punches into warp but now the vessel makes a final splintering snap as it disappears and there is a brilliantly iridescent blue trail that the camera immerses us in as it crackles and pops as if even its speed is a living entity and abrams also understands there is nothing like being aboard the captains command center it has a luminous blue and white that shimmers in its intensity making it what it should be a magical place that pulses with the presence of command even the inclusion of the very appropriate but always missing permission to come aboard the bridge is a welcome addition addressing not only proper naval etiquette but also the privilege it is to enter the command center of a ship and especially the enterprise as for characterization the new trek advances the personalities of the crew without being faithful to the characters they inhabit there is so much that is correct here in this new iteration of the storyline that i continually found myself actors morphing into the original characters chris pine inhabits captain kirk perfectly he has his swagger and seeming invincibility down so pat that his eventual moment of humility seems truly genuine and moving the opinion of sheldon of asin b vzuwzw aside zachary quintos spock and karl urbans bones are so spot on that they seem to inhabit the skin of the original actors to say too much in the way of specifics would be reveal spoilers but i will tell you that attention is being given to the original series in so many ways so many moments will cause trekkers to grin and beyond the more obvious ones there are even some moments and actions that only real trekkers would notice for instance and dont worry im being cautious of spoilers the very fact that chekov is absent from the bridge for a while is significant as is the name of a new character if theres no trekker around you look it up and benedict cumberbatch is also magnificent as the villain john harrison truly intense and dark he seems to inhabit his rogue with a sinister passion his lip seems to curl with each word and he loads the glare of his eye with an evil intensity as deep as space he is more than a match for kirk and the enterprise and he carries off his role with such a style that there must be some way to get him to return in the future i would look forward to that so much that id look for a wormhole to get there abrams has taken a giant leap ahead with stid he has created a universe like the original but with the ability to take the old stories and move on from there with respect and admiration for the original above all i suspect roddenberry himself would have liked this new take on his franchise because it envisions what he had hoped for a universe built upon respect for individual rights where to quite liberally quote the famous mantra to boldly go where no one has gone before or if they did to go there again and do something unique the next time around reverentially carefully and with great love 
i am a long time hardcore star trek fan from the mid s i have to say i loved the new star trek movie stars a great story great acting great cgi it felt like star trek if you can see it on imax going to see it again next weekend cant wait to dvd coms out 
i will not go into much detail here the graphics were great the story line was great and the movie was awsum my opinion i did not see it in the thearter i saw it at home the day it came out in the movies my brother works in hollywood the day the movie is ready for release in the movies the studios have the dvd copy locked in warehouses i recieved a legit box set legal box set not a pirated burn buy this movie you will dot be disapointed 
 spoilers a lot of negative reviews are posted here the general theme of these reviews is a long and drawn out rant about how roddenberry kept true to the science and developed his stories better what a load of crap i will admit in the first reboot the red matter was pretty far fetched thats about it abrams more than makes up for it in this rehash of wrath of khan just like the original there is a death this time its kirk instead of spock same scenario radiation exposure saying i love you man through the glass etc much better acting this time around we all loved shatner and we all agree he cant act so i think its time to quit doggin on pine at least he has some sort of acting skill the problem people have is using khans superhuman blood to resurrect kirk why not theyre both human after all obviously wouldnt work on a vulcan in the original but in this version its plausible from a scientific standpoint rewind years back and how did roddenberry resurrect spock oh yeah it was genesis the magical torpedo that terraforms an uninhabitable rock planetoid that is not located within the habitable zone of any nearby star if it was it would not have been devoid of any atmosphere that is an astrophysical fact period roddenberry took a giant dump on astrophysics in the original and abrams spun the story slightly in order to make it scientifically plausible so you folks who are compelled to debate the science in these films better come to the table armed with some actual knowledge for every unbelievable aspect you try to point out in this new version i will cite examples from the roddenberry era its time to give abrams some credit and quit berating his work simply because you cant separate yourselves from the roddenberry era for just two hours so you can enjoy an entertaining film ive enjoyed all of the star trek films i never could get into tos but the later series were pretty good and yes despite genesis i enjoyed the wrath of khan just dont try to come at me with scientific appraisals of the original films it wont hold water 
jj abrams has done it again dont care what anybody has to say this movie has it all and then some more and more abrams has done one heck of a job with this just came back from seeing it with the family all everyone loved it i have seen a good deal of movies over the years but i would rather see them at home this is one of the very very fue movies i have seen that i can say i enjoyed in the theater cant see how anyone can say that abrams has lost his touch the second this movies ended i turned to my wife and said im ready for part i cant wait for the dvd as soon as possible next week i hope lets see its may that means oct cant wait the sooner they get this on dvd bluray the better if you liked the last film i really cant see why you would not like this from my hole family its a thanks jj you are one heck of a writer and director cant wait to see what you do with star wars 
i was one of the original group that wanted no part of the new star trek movies i am proud to say i feel that way no more these movies have given me emotions i have never felt in the original movies that mixed with the special effects superb acting and writing have made me an even bigger fan of the star trek universe the movie was over hours long but it felt like half that and left me wanting more there is not a character that i do not love just as much as in the original the newer movies seem dark but seem to add just enough humor and emotion not to overwhelm you i would recommend this movie to any that are on the fence about seeing it if it can attract and put tears in the eyes of my daughter who up until a few years ago refused to watch any of the old star trek series or movies it can make you a fan also 
this is my favorite star trek movie ever and ive seen them all the cast is fantastic and benedict cumberbatch is mesmerizing 
im an old dog takes me a bit to learn a new trick i keep trying to draw parallels to the old star trek while due to circumstances in the first of this movie series it is definitely on a separate track however insofar as the character the young man who plays bones is spot on and the young man who plays spock well i paused the move at one moment to do something i happened to glace at the screen i he looks like a stockier lenard nimoy and he portrays a very good vulcan as well the young man who plays kirk i know they had to glitzs it up a bit so keeping in perspective he pulls it off alright i enjoyed how they brought back characters from the past yet set them on a different path because of the changed circumstances overall i very much enjoyed this movie good action plot twists yet some characters who were familiar enough to be comfortable with yet new enough to keep it fun 
what a great follow up to star trek went twice to see if and enjoyed both times i will definitely buy the blu ray
until this morning star trek ii the wrath of khan was always the gold standard for the entire star trek movie series in my humble opinion when i first heard that benedict cumberbatch was going to be in the new star trek movie i thought that he did a wonderful job in sherlock but what can he add to the star trek saga aside from the fact that he and leonard nimoy have ties to bilbo baggins perhaps gollum would make a surprise appearance with bilbo and spock will sing the ballad of bilbo baggins so i was very hesitant when i went to see this movie and boy i was so very wrong star trek into darkness is now the new gold standard for the entire star trek series the story was fast paced and kept the audiences attention in our theater my wife who has absolutely no knowledge about star trek really enjoyed watching the movie so much so that she wants to see the prior star trek movie as for me i thought the movie excelled because of benedict cumberbatch as john harrison in several scenes you could actually hear people gasping at what mr cumberbatch was doing on the screen he would suddenly appear or do something so shocking that you would be jumping out of your seat in the end you could actually believe that he is a superior being capable of outwitting the entire federation his performance alone was well worth the price of a ticket also it was great to see peter weller back on the screen again i hope he will do more movies in the future and step away from academia for a bit by the time the movie was finished people were actually giving the movie a standing ovation jj abrams has outdone himself in re making the new star trek series and is truly the heir apparent of nicholas meyer in the action suspense department 
after having watched all of the other star trek spinoff movies and tv series i found this one to be right up near the top it was fast moving contained appropriate amounts of comic relief and a gripping climax unlike other star trek shows this one did not contain too many funky aliens i recommend this movie highly even though you dont have the rental option 
this was a really good movie i was never into star trek but my mom wanted to see because she is a star trek fan and for not watching any of the old movies or tv shows i thought that this was pretty good now i want to watch the old movies and tv shows just to let people who have not seen this movie yet it is basically a remake of the wrath of kahn but they did a good job at it now i have to see the wrath of kahn all in all this was a great movie if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
ive watched it twice now first in d and then in d and found it even more entertaining the second time around when i watched it the first time i didnt really think about the scenes that would emphasize the d effect but when i watched it in d it became clear why they had been photographed the way they had i must admit i found myself dodging spears in the d version ive begun to grow accoustomed to the new cast of characters and im not really sure why that may be i dont know if theyre adapting to their roles better or ive just gotten a little more used to seeing them in those roles regardless the new cast is less of an issue now than it was in their first movie and i was better able to simply enjoy the story and the movie this is probably only my imagination but the younger versions of the characters are beginning to remind me more of their more familiar older versions one bit of trivia that i found interesting was the introduction of carol the one who becomes the mother of kirks son david star trek fans will already know how that ends i must admit im looking forward to seeing what the next installment may bring 
one aspect of this film that demands more of a mention is something that has been sorely lacking in most of the trek films through the years suspense the original series had some truly suspenseful nail biting moments that were unlike any suspense seen anywhere before the enterprise incident obsession day of the dove and the doomsday machine all had moments of edge of your seat suspense and there were several others but when it came to the films something malfunctioned on the level of a major engineering blunder that would send mr scott into a tizzy the suspense was largely gone seems impossible given that with a film there are more opportunities for intense suspense thanks to more time and better budgets which could lead to more elaborate plot points that could create tense situations but alas star trek got it wrong until now with star trek into darkness we are treated to more suspense than the total sum of all suspenseful moments from the entire original series if youre not on the edge of your seat watching this movie trekker trekkie or not you must be a cliff diver or live on rollercoasters some of why the film is so suspenseful is the pacing itself abrams and his team barely allow you to recover from one suspenseful situation before the plot which is excellent hurls another one at you thats not to say the film doesnt contain moments of heart and those humanistic elements roddenberry built the franchise on they are there and in more abundance than has been recognized by other reviewers due to the pulse pounding action and incredible visual effects that will have you wanting to be a part of the enterprise crew more than ever before abrams does a marvelous job at properly recreating in the new altered timeline everything that made the original series such a terrific show and he manages to make it fresh and appealing to everyone even more so than the first of his forays into the star trek universe that there is a villain from a place you might not have seen coming besides the villain that everyone has been muttering about yes there are two villains in this film that adds that topical touch of reflection of current headlines to the mix another hallmark of much of the writing of the second and third seasons of the original series is also a welcome plot point to sum it up abrams and his crew have a huge uphill battle to endure now that they have so perfectly put together the most satisfying trek film ever created heres hoping abrams is up to the challenge and that he will continue going where no man has gone before 
great great movie i cant wait for the next one hope the whole cast signs on for the next one 
i am so glad i have added this movie to my collection so exciting i do wish they had picked someone who resembled the kahn of the t v series this one was good but not a nice looking i am a treki from way back thank you again denise
as a life long fan of al the star trek variations i am very pleased with the continuing saga of kirk spock uss and revisiting story lines from the original series with the time twist introduced in the last film very well done it is with great anticipation that i await the next chapter in this saga i doubt i will ever tire of it 
 star trek into darkness i greatly enjoyed seeing this in the theater not as much as the first j j abrams reboot movie which was just so dynamic and clean but still a lot i like what these guys are doing with the characters with the ground level view of the formative years of the federation and in particular with the concept of this being an alternate reality star trek universe the concept was introduced at the end of the first film and even though i knew this and consciously reminded myself of it before going into this second film i still found myself halfway through the movie thinking oh thus and such cant happen since it doesnt fit the continuity or i wonder how theyre going to change that back so itll fit in with what we know happens later and it wasnt until way way far in that i realized that this version of star trek is going to be a lot different than the reality we already know its a really profound divergence and they are having a lot of fun with it me too we all left the theater psyched and ready for more if the movie theater production schedule proves too ponderous i sure hope theyll consider keeping this cast and crew together for a tv series theyre all doing great work with a special shout out to zachary quinto who has definitively made the new universe spock his own great stuff bring on number three dj joe sixpack slipcue film reviews 
amazing incredible awesome get it at this point i put j j abrams at the top of the list for director and film producer this guy knows how to find incredible acting talent and put together an amazing film next up hes going to be directing star wars i just cannot wait to see how he improves those films 
this disc is just a bare bones movie with no special features i loved the movie and the way the not so pure motives ofstar fleet officials brought this problem on themselves lots of double dealing by all parties concerned and some niceuse of situations from some of the older star trek movies will keep you on your toes to paraphrase spock have faiththat it will turn out as it should 
just received my package with the phaser yesterday sept th arrived early and the prop is nice looks and feels like a real phaser detail is excellent this is one prop worthy of adding to ones collection my and my best friend who i met at a star trek convention in dayton both went to see this her twice me three times we both agree as far as trek films goes this is one of the best of the we laughed cried and another friend of mine was getting so carried away with the fight scenes between spock and kahn he kept saying hit him hit him again now that is when you know it is a good movie i am going to see this one again for the fourth time i think gene roddenberry would be happy the phaser with the gift set is very nice feels real has heft and spinning barrel is cool 
in one word amazing jj does it again star trek into darkness is is nothing short of epic a fantastic adventure that will appeal on so many levels to hard core fans and newbies alike i highly recommend this movie 
i and my family are hooked on the new star trek series of movies we ended up seeing it in the theater twice and bought it so we can watch it again and again the more you watch it the more you realize you missed some little tidbits that tell what is going to happen later in the movie 
great expansion to the star trek saga although the story line is different from the original series it still follows along with some of the story in its own way while some of the die hard trekies will denounce it for being to action oriented i would like to think that if gene rodenberry had the ability to make his tv shows and movies this believable with the action i think he would have regardless of action they still have the underlying message gene wanted to convey however subtle it is since this is based off his world hopefully this will allow for a new and younger generation of star trek lovers 
 star trek into darkness manages to be several entertaining movies at once it is first a very exciting action movie with lots of excellent special effects that should hold the viewers interest from start to finish second it is a well done prequel to the earlier star trek movies and even the television series we get to meet the crew of the starship enterprise before that five year mission of exploration the actors who portray the main characters at a younger age should be instantly recognizable to generations of star trek fans third the movie is a fairly clever remix of familiar story elements that pays homage but is not a slavish imitation of those earlier stories the movie succeeds particularly well in exploring the interactions of the main characters and in rebooting the most famous villain of the star trek series the movie begins with an extended action sequence on a distant world where captain james t kirk chris pine has once again exceeded his guidance and put his crew and ship at risk kirk gets out of it by violating rules and directives and finds himself demoted and separated from spock zachary quinto when he returns to earth the actions of a vengeful starfleet officer named john harrison a superb benedict cumberbatch create a new crisis seemingly tailor made for kirks talents he is restored to command and sent after the bad guy who is hiding out on the edge of the klingon part of the galaxy harrison turns out to have a surprising agenda and equally surprising enemies he and kirk must be uncertain allies for a time but the audience knows there will eventually be a confrontation one so serious that kirk spock and the crew of enterprise will be tested to their limits this movie is great fun and highly recommended 
i really enjoyed the star trek when it first came out in theaters but repeated viewings have not improved my feelings visually it is stunning and i have no issues with the casting or acting but the plot is a mess and chris pines interpretation of captain kirk is way off the mark i dont blame pine because thats the way hes written into darkness corrects a lot of the things that bothered me about the first movie and the plot is tighter another problem i had with the movie was that it had absolutely no message and really didnt honor gene roddenberrys legacy into darkness does have a message and its a good one but the film doesnt bludgeon the viewer with the message my top three favorite star trek movies are wrath of khan search for spock and undiscovered country into darkness doesnt break into my top three but it is one of the better star trek film despite the feelings of many star trek fans i prefer the more intimate early films but for those who prefer a huge budget action packed thrill ride into darkness delivers let me give a special nod to the design of the u s s vengeance which if you havent seen it yet is perhaps the most awesome ship star trek has ever produced and that includes the romulan narada from the previous film that blew may away in into darkness actually reminds me a lot of skyfall if you can believe it from a technical standpoint both films may be at the pinnacle of their respective series the casting the special effects the set designs and the big moments are thrilling when the enterprise rises from an alien ocean it is positively awe inspiring and then my inner star trek nerd pinches me and says wait why was the enterprise underwater just like with skyfall its much better if you dont think too hard about the plot the plot is much better than the complete nonsense of the previous film but a coherent plot never seems to be the goal of j j abrams so fans can either accept it or do as some star trek fans did and declare into darkness the works star trek film ever the new series is just a whole new animal from the previous films comparing wrath of khan to into darkness is like comparing skyfall to goldfinger they are so different as to be incomparable you can either accept the changes or cling to the classics but i think that to say this film is terrible on its own merits is just wrong one of the biggest complaints was near the end when into darkness essentially remade one of the most famous scenes from one of the earliest movies and i wont deny that it made me cringe i would call the whole scene ill advised rather than a ruination of the movie as some online reviews have suggested im also not thrilled with the casting of benedict cumberbatch not that he isnt an astounding revelation as an actor and a great addition to star trek but the character he plays just doesnt fit i can sympathize with many of the criticisms of the film but in the end like skyfall the enjoyment of the experience outweighed the demerits of my own personal criticisms and a repeated viewing only reinforced my appreciation of the movie 
great story in the continuing saga of spock and kirk story was good too but i felt a bit sorry for the villian after all he didnt ask to be created to be the way he was and he was only trying to save his family but evil is evil and he had to be defeated although he really wasnt spoiler 
i am just back from the theater watching star trek into darkness and i think that one word describes this movie amazing i have seen many negative reviews saying this movie was cliched had too many special effects and was too much of a knockoff on earlier plots to all of those who have seen this movie and didnt think it was wonderful i can say only one thing you are not a true star trek fan i have been watching the show for close to years and found this movie to be among the best of all the movies ever done in this series first of all lets get some things out there the special effects were excellent the sound quality and music was phenomenal while i was concerned that there might be too much action in this movie in reality i felt it fit very nicely into the plot and didnt overwhelm the movie the acting was great the characters who played the classic character parts from the movie all were stellar in their roles in this movie some highlights included a welcome expansion of uhuras role in this movie when you see her you will be happy she is on our side the continued crotchetiness of mccoy including one of his im a doctor not a comments another very humorous rendition of scotty including several classic commentsbenedict cumberbatch was chilling as john harrison khan although im not sure he looked the part of khan given the incredible job that ricardo montalban did with this character in both the original space seed and in star trek ii the wrath of khan there were many other excellent performances including the actors who played admiral pike admiral marcus and dr carol marcus now to the plot it was an ingenious reboot of the entire khan space opera it took elements of the original episode and the movie and incorporated them into a new take on one of the best story concepts in the entire star trek franchise it also reminded one of the episodes from star trek enterprise where the augments were first described the plot was very reminiscent of many things including the entire khan story the notion of a senior starfleet officer going bad like the pegasus in tng and the cinematic extravaganza that occurs near the end when kirk sacrifices his own life to save the crew i think it is very interesting how in this reboot kirk dies and spock lives while in twok it was the other way around i enjoyed jj abrams approach in solving this problem so more movies could come forth from this one most importantly this movie did everything that a great star trek movie should do it involved a great storyline good character development and a fully satisfying villain who the crew had to defeat it also paid homage to many things about star trek which made it so great it was funny scary action packed and riveting even though you knew in the end that the crew would prevail it didnt stop you from gripping the edge of your seat as you waited for it to happen put simply it caused star trek to shine yet again and i fully believe that gene roddenberry is looking down smiling about this one if you havent seen the movie yet please go see it and relax and enjoy it dont overanalyze it or sit there and pick it apart just watch the movie and be happy that there are people who love this franchise so much that they keep on making new movies i think that this movie will go down as among the best of the series finally i sincerely hope that at the end when it seems like the year mission was going to be launched that this means there will be more of these movies to come there are several great story lines from the original series that could use a fresh reboot and i hope to see one of those someday 
spoilers the only thing i didnt like was the decision at the last minute to make the character of john harrison kahn kahn deserved a separate movie with a fresh approach 
just like the first new and re booted trek movie i liked this one more than i expected to the acting was very good the special effects were absolutely spectacular even on the small screen and the script was quite well done it made me wish i had gotten to see it on the big screen but oh well this way i can watch it again and again on my blu ray just like the first movie this one pays homage to original trek but without going overboard on it that can be quite the feat and so far they are managing it very well indeed the familiar relationships between the main characters are there all the affection and teasing even if they are being played by new actors and there are occasional twists that we never saw in original trek but were sometimes hinted at you never know when an old name with a new face will appear and it keeps you guessing are they the same as what weve seen before or will they turn out to have a very different role in things i really do enjoy the alternate universe they are exploring in this series i am especially enjoying the new old mccoy and a very sassy and spitfire uhura hey we always knew she had it in her kirk is wild and footloose in his personal life and yet dedicated to his ship and his crew once again some things never change for good reason spock well some part of me will always see leonard nimoy but the actor we see in this series is definitely growing on me i really like the new scotty we get to see much more of the humor in his character even as he is still a genius with engines the movie opens with kirk having been demoted for one of the issues he was always getting into on old trek playing fast and loose with the prime directive i guess some things never change however nothing keeps jim down long because soon star fleet needs him again once they are under attack by a brilliant and dangerous man who is out to destroy them kirk and the enterprise are sent to bring back this criminal from no less than the klingon homeworld where any mis step could result in war between the federation and the klingon empire can anyone see what is coming next i wont give away any of the plot twists and secrets but this one definitely will bring back old memories and revisit them in a new way i found myself crying once again thanks still and all i think this movie will please both the old and new generations of trek fans i look forward to another movie and what they will do in the future keep em coming 
this is a great star trek movie where the immature captain jim kurt becomes the kurt that he is in the tv series 
let me state right off that as a star trek fan since the night it premiered on nbc i loved this film i saw it the day it opened and again last week at the best imax theater in manhattan and i think it is terrific even better than the first film the actors are all superb especially pine quinto cumberbatch and bruce greenwood as admiral pike the film is loaded with action i remember thinking that it was a very long film not because i was bored but because every time you think it is over we get another terrific action sequence the d was also excellent way better than iron man i look forward to getting it on blu ray and i cannot truly state that i wont see it one more time in the movies however i am so tired of the nit pickers and complainers that i have run into about this film one person stated that there were no surprises well yeah if you are the internet hours a day reading every rumor and bit of information or downloading the film before it opened in the u s then i guess there wouldnt be any surprises i stayed away from all these rumors as i usually do and i found many surprises in this film one thing i didnt expect literally made me jump forward in my seat no not khan ive heard other complaints that this and that didnt make sense hey guys wake up its a movie and its a sci fi movie just sit back and enjoy it in case you havent figured it out i thought this movie was great and look forward to another one a few years from now 
without giving away any portion of the overall plot i wanted to share the best scene for me uhura is about to deboard a shuttle and abrams without a single cutaway pans from the top of the still landing shuttle to the side where uhuras standing at the doorway as the door opens downward and gently touches the planet surface uhura walks down the steps and leaves the shuttle this scene was filmed perfectly in d there is so much computer graphic and live actor interaction and yet at the higher resolution and in d there were absolutely no glitches giving away the technical makeup of the scene it leaves the viewer in the movie without them analyzing the faults i was really impressed on how well jj abrams used d in this movie the story is fantastic and you must watch star trek the wrath of kahn and star trek the original series botany bay to get the full aspect of how abrams staff paid tribute yet blazed their own path in their new star trek timeline 
i had already seen this in the theater i wanted my wife to see she did and really liked it i was really happy that was a good movie night ps of course she had a lot of questions given that she has never seen any star trek movie hahaha
star trek into darkness is a magnificent re working of familiar events conflicts and old enemies with the endless potential of the alternate reality scenario star trek into darkness surreptitiously reworks events and characters from star trek ii the wrath of khan and the original star trek series via the possibilities of this alternate reality this time out the cohesion of the story the characters and dramatics are much more focused and defined honed to perfection for this new vision the story is more compelling as it unfolds when compared to its predecessor into darkness is aptly named the performances of the primary characters are well defined and realized chris pine demonstrates a controlled intellectual and emotional force that the script did not focus on karl urbans performance demonstrates that bones does not exactly have a continued predilection for irrelevancy as is seen on the big screen benedict cumberbatchs villainy is brilliantly realized in his histrionic performance as for the plot it is a powerful one often thought provoking and exhilarating it looks like star trek is back and here to stay 
i usually think of spock as a master of deception however i am starting to like the new spock he is honest brave and sensitive to others the plot is great year old villain is revived khan the wolf sonn is brought back from cryogenic freeze to build advanced weapons designed to destroy the klingon empire the admiral feels that war is inevitable and that he will be the general leading the war in an effort to destroy the crew of bounty bay pods armed with photon missiles is target at the klingon homework the plot almost worked but kirk decides to bring khan back to earth to face his crimes and answer for the death of admiral pike kirk saves spock spock saves kirk mccoy saves kirk spock kicks khans butt the war with the klingons does not happen spock fight scenes are fantastic the vulcan nerve pinch the vulcan death touch and the rage within vulcans are war like race that control their combat tendencies spock demonstrates a high degree of courage and resourcefulness khan skull crushing technique is very ruthless khan is a superior being psychopathic killer with desires to conquer kirk is set to fall in love with dr marcus the cast was great scottie was resourceful and the trans warp technology remains innovative chekov continues to be impressive at the helm and in engineering the warp core looks like a fusion reactor or collider a nice twist between sci fi and real world technology the sci fi special efforts were great i loved the cgi city the colors and backgrounds and the music what do we learn about the federation we learn the federation is war like and the top brass is invest in technology that will defeat the klingons or any enemy the federation is powerful and armed with a weapon that can destroy ships in warp a predator ship we learn the federation moon of praxis has been destroyed the klingons are tribal and in survival status however there was no indication that the klingons were trying to occupy federation planets or were attacking the federation uhara correctly accesses the klingons as having honor the klingon code of honor makes them less of a villain the klingons are in a civil war and the tribes or clans are struggling for power the federation does not seem interested in helping the klingons rebuilt and prefers them to remain in a state of chaos backward development and isolated 
seeing this movie in imax d literally improved the overall quality of my life i never wanted it to end im still trying to come to terms with the fact that all good things eventually do my therapist says as long as the voices dont come back i should be ok at some point lol
normally sequels are not better that the original but this movie proves that theory wrong i dont want to give away plot if you like the first of this series with these actors if you are a true star trek fan you will appreciate this file also anything jj abrahms does is good bad robot production sure miss that show fringe very smart get this movie 
fantastic movie just as good as the first one saw it in imax d yesterday loved it glad its making a lot of money hopefully the third installment is in the works ignore the naysayers see it for yourself entertainment weekly gave it an a usually they dont give those away if you are a true fan of the star trek franchise im sure youll love it 
ive been a star trek fan most of my life and a tos fan nearly as long i adored the new movie some people complain about excessive borrowing from twok but i absolutely loved the way they chose to parallel some of the most poignant moments of the original films with the abramsverse twist i saw the film times in the theater and every time my eyes were glued to the screen and my heart was in my throat at the crucial times kirk really grew into his role as a leader and spock really came across as both more at ease with his humanity his emotions and his experiences in the previous film also gave him a slightly angry edge but can you blame him another wonderful addictive installment in the trek film series lets hope they dont make us wait four years for the next one 
definitely the best big budget blockbuster of the year so far does not disappoint on any level whatsoever while the fans may have been impatient for abrams to get the ball rolling on this sequel ever since the release of the franchise reboot practical reasoning makes it obvious that waiting is always better if the product is successful in this sequel the same emotions feelings and thoughts from the first star trek are all explored again but on a much deeper and more aggressive level this also goes for everything else in the movie much like the first movie the acting is superb the action is crazy but terrific and the unexpected plot points are of course always welcome some have compared this film to iron man skyfall and the dark knight rises in its execution they say that they are all too similar in plot because they all feature a central male character that is known to regret his feelings and actions from the past they all feature an enigmatic villain that defeats and or humiliates the character on their own turf the main character then has to make a decision whether or not to step outside their comfort zone all at potential great cost to everyone else while i agree that these similarities are true and very interesting they do not discredit any of the mentioned films each of these films is fashioned in a different way and gives the viewer an entirely different feeling so i for one no matter what any detractors of this film may say highly recommend this film to any star trek or sci fi fan or any movie fan in general it is absolutely amazing 
j j abrams who very successfully rebooted the long dormant star trek franchise in stated that he wanted to make a trek film that wasnt exclusively for trek fans he wanted to make a film that anyone could get on board with the new crew of the uss enterprise and enjoy just as much as longtime fans of the show and the previous films it worked extremely well as an extremely entertaining and rollicking piece of summer entertainment and not only was pleasing to those longtime fans but brought in new fans as well now abrams is doubling down on the existing fans of the star trek universe and still looking to bring in new fans with star trek into darkness which is such a breathtaking piece of stellar entertainment that it stands currently as the film to beat for this summer admittedly its hard to review this film without spoiling a myriad of plot points but ill do my best to avoid that the film opens with all of our crew members returning to the enterprise chris pine as james t kirk zachary quinto as spock karl urban as bones mccoy zoe saldana as uhura john cho as sulu anton yelchin as chekov and simon pegg as scotty are all back and theyre trying to save a planet from its own destruction but kirk violates starfleets infamous prime directive in saving spock this gets kirk busted down by admiral pike bruce greenwood also reprising to his first officer and spock reassigned to another ship but a terrorist explosion in london at a starfleet facility carried out by rogue starfleet officer john harrison benedict cumberbatch most famous for his work as the titular detective in bbcs sherlock forces the upper echelon of starfleet captains into a military operation overseen by admiral marcus peter weller to take down harrison a horrific attack brings kirk spock and the rest of the crew including a new science officer carol marcus alice eve into conflict with harrison and his plans for his revenge on starfleet which quickly escalates beyond what they would have imagined and not every crew member will be returning from this voyage abrams and writers alex kurtzman roberto orci and damon lindelof most of these are part of abrams crew working on some of his television shows like lost fringe and alias as well as some of his other films like mission impossible iii and the previous trek film are not reinventing the wheel here with into darkness but they are making that wheel turn at a frenetic and not frantic speed all of the action and set pieces are huge and are tremendously exciting particularly a sequence where a badly damaged enterprise is plummeting towards earth being probably the highlight but its hard to say which is the most exciting and its clear that the films of abrams youth of the late s and early s particularly films by steven spielberg to whom he made the brilliant love letter to in s super have heavily influenced this film in how it moves and how it feels the film has a breakneck pace that few of the more recent tentpole releases have had but when it does need to slow down it makes all it can of those scenes and here not only do the action sequences dazzle from a technical standpoint there is a reason for them to be taking place both from a story and especially from a character point of view there arent many plot contrivances here that just propel the action forward and dont serve a need of character or story elements which was something i felt seriously hindered the other big summer release so far the tepid iron man another standout here is the brilliant score from returning composer michael giacchino who has become abrams john williams here rising the highs and sombering the lows of the story with his work the returning cast once again do an excellent job filling their roles on the enterprise with each character getting a severely kick ass moment in the narrative but from an enterprise perspective as is usually the case this film is very much about kirk and spock and their bromance which is a mix of antagonism and deep caring however this film if its anyones its cumberbatchs performance that keeps you on your toes and keeps you transfixed its a performance of absolute superiority not only in a character related sense but just the skill in which he envelops himself with his perfect diction his physicality and his sense that hes not the bad guy here because no good villain thinks theyre a villain he does what he thinks is right and what he knows to be superior to anyone elses goals just barely running second to cumberbatch though is once again quinto who was the standout of the first film as well as spock he treads a careful line between his half human half vulcan sides and this is the first time in this series of feature length films where we see at times a much more emotional side of spock and it ultimately makes for a more compelling character as well as a much more fulfilling performance dont get me wrong i love leonard nimoy as spock but i never felt that he could do more like i feel with quinto the only cast member that feels short changed here is newcomer eve who sadly has been in some truly abysmal films such as sex and the city and the raven because other than being someone who is obviously important in the series mythology she doesnt really have a lot to do its hard to keep the secrets that constantly cloak the productions of j j abrams when youre reviewing one of his works but i find that if you just stick to the basics you can avoid things that people want to go in fresh to the only thing i will state here is that like in the first film theres a lot of fan service to some of the bigger films of the original crews films but even moreso in this film some have called this film a remake which it most decidedly is not despite there being similar situations and even a strange mirror universe restaging of one of the more famous scenes in the series and the reason its not a remake is because of that whole mirror universe alternate timeline that abrams so refreshingly set the stage for in the first film of the reboot that gives the narrative of this series a very unpredictible sensibility there were moments i didnt see coming at all and whats more is that no one crew member ever seems safe to return for the next film abrams really risks running the ire of fans with this series and probably even moreso with this film but so far it seems to be paying off in spades if s star trek was that summers iron man than abrams into darkness is very much s avengers its a mighty film with an epic scope great performances great humor and a satisfaction that only the best of the summer blockbusters can give and will be very difficult to surpass on that level of sheer entertainment 
i am a fan of star trek starting way back with the original released series i have enjoyed them all this second film in the current series captures all of the elements of the original team and amplifies it to the point of perfection each character remains true to the original in their own unique performances chris pine has the ability to communicate extremely strong emotional intensity the new younger spock has an obvious grasp of who he is or is becoming the humor and character interplay is quick sharp and constantly building keep this thing going for many years to come you got it right 
this is a great escapist film with wide appeal unlike too many cgi intense films human relationships drive a great story written with intelligence and respect for the source material a talented cast delivers on every level you do not need to be a trekkie to enjoy this great movie visually stunning star trek into darkness never quits 
i love this movie but as soon as my membership was paid for the program is giving me problems i really want to keep this membership but if this is going to continue i am going to have to cancel my membership 
jj abrams reboot of star trek in breathed new life into a franchise which cbs had given up on and which paramount seemed non committal to in its present form the result was a film which seemed to please current fans but which brought in a new fan base younger movie goers and overseas audiences making star trek the highest grossing movie in franchise history that bit of magic gave paramount the balls to try a sequel with the new cast and gave abrams some bit of clout resulting in an imax presentation of the film as well as d because of the reboots appeal with new audiences particularly overseas where star trek has historically performed very poorly the studio wanted to insure a wide appeal to justify the largest budget ever for a star trek film focus groups were shown cut after cut of the film to give every beat of the movie the maximum appeal to audiences the result is a star trek which is unparalleled in terms of being a very deliberately engineered product the movie is clearly designed as a big budget event movie more than it is a star trek movie removed or thickly veiled are many of the elements of previous star trek incarnations literary references idealistic ideologies and existential themes instead it tries to satisfy fans with star trek references that might not be easily identified by newbies for instance they reference section a plot element from the deep space series and as far as i know doesnt appear in any of the other series they introduce the character carol marcus which is significant if youve seen the wrath of khan a million times and recognize her as the mother of captain kirks son david there is also a quick discussion about the prime directive and then thats pretty much the end of star trek culture outside of costuming so given that the movie is a product more than any other star trek to date the questions become is the movie any good and is this a good star trek movie i have to say yes on both counts this movie breaks the warp barrier in terms of action s star trek had more action than any star trek to date this one starts at a run literally and the viewer has to work to catch up the whole show some in my family felt like the movie was moving so fast it was hard to catch all of what was going on i didnt feel like that myself but i can see their point the trek archetypal characterizations are really well performed by the cast and i really enjoyed the interaction between the characters additionally the screenwriters have done a good job constructing dialog which feels true to each character theres plenty of humor here but maybe not as much as the last film theres just no room time for joking around the plot revolves around a terrorist attack which spurs starfleet brass to mount an assassination attempt kirk fights with his feelings for revenge and as the plot unfolds interesting conspiracies arise the emotional component of the film is another strength of the film characters are given emotional motivations and the stakes are high both for earth and starfleet but also for the enterprise crew all the cast get a nice emotional beat in the film though chekov probably gets slighted a little bit there are obvious references to the best of all previous star trek films which are handled expertly familiar but wholly new i loved the obvious tribute to the previous films as well as the new perspective from the eyes of this parallel universe crew the thing i have always loved about star trek in all its incarnations is the bond between the crew that bond of friendship is at the heart of star trek into darkness and is the movies greatest success 
as others seem to gravitate to extreme verbosity while reviewing ill be brief this was an amazing ride non stop action from the opening sequence to the final scene it has everything great story great characters great villians great special fx humor comradarie grief loss and of course the enterprise the only gripe i have is it became a little fatiguing as they continued to encounter even tougher challenges at each turn but it was very fun to watch them overcome this new cast is the epitome of who these characters are all of them are excellent choices even though bones is a little bit of a stretch lets hope it doesnt take more years to put up another rip roaring adventure because i want to see more of these people playing these parts oh and even though this is a great movie in its own right kirks kaaaaahhhhhhhnnnnnn was much better in the original st to jj abrahms and whoever helms the new movies that are sure to come live long and prosper 
the story line was interesting it definitely deviated from the timeline of the original but time was established as relative in the first movie im definitely interested to see where the creators take the next movie 
i was really hoping this would be as good as the and it surpassed my expectations i love the movie and it is also different too there are some changes in certain events such as who is the one to repair the core reactor on enterprise yet it works with the script too without giving any more away for those who havent seen it yet i will move on to say this i foresee that there will be more in this series and i hope the actors will stay with it to keep it running well the actors can age in this quite nicely as they will in real life so there will be continuation i just cant wait to see what comes next i was a fan of the original star trek on tv and of all the movies so it is great to now see new versions which capture the spirit of the old originals love chris pine as kirk because he carries all of william shatners old mannerisms but also interjects new ones that make him special the other actors have also made their own marks to compile a great new crew for enterprise which can last for a long time its fun and we all need some fun and escapism right now in our lives just one question when will they give cupcake his own action moment just dont kill him off 
 star trek into darkness is the best movie so far this year expertly plotted edited and directed its funny and scary the villain whose true identity i wont spoil is scary as hell way scarier than that nero dude from the first movie and i love how the new films acknowledge the shatner nimoy films that came before its very clever 
this is a great movie awesome follow up to a great relaunch i felt this wone kept me on the edge of my seat i cant wait to get home to watch this 
i think through my long sometimes geekish love affair with all things star trek and wonder how it can continue will i ever grow out of it then jj abrams makes another fantastic star trek movie and i know the love affair will continue the entire cast is just perfect if i were re booting the franchise myself i dont think i could have come up with a better set of actors to represent who i imagine these characters to be i thought that after the first reboot movie and they continue to prove themselves to be the right cast including of all people bruce greenwood as pike love him in the role same goes for all of them i found it comically ironic that peter weller was the bad guy can he play anything else of course i continue to be amazed at how pleased i am at the role of zachary quinto as spock the movie visuals were amazing special effects awesome as expected music great story great ah kahn you genetically engineered devil of the originals the wrath of kahn was the best movie by far ricardo maltaban as khan was great but benedict cumberbatch really did a fine job but this re imagined prequel is pretty great as well nicely done abrams 
let me go out on a limb here and just say star trek into darkness is just as good as the reboot and dare i say a tad better you need not be a lifelong fan to enjoy this spectacular roller coaster ride of a movie but if you are you will enjoy it o so much better the inferences nods to past tv episodes the early movies of the s are in of themselves so richly rewarding you will find yourself unable to control your smiling as you discover the creativeness of the writing as the originality of the story keeps that alternate reality concept going this film is one of the most enjoyable films to come out in a long long time it is thoroughly entertaining the audience i saw it with stood up and clapped when was the last time you experienced that in a movie theater as previously stated stid propels you on a non stop roller coaster ride but also has a great deal of heart as well the friendship dynamic between spock kirk is further developed in a really great dramatic way some reviewers poo pooed the character traits of all the beloved crew as being tired predictable however as a star trek fan isnt that what weve come to expect in fact a true fan would be truly disappointed if scotty mccoy did not behave accordingly a major surprise awaits and is done in such a subtle unexpected manner that you never see it coming thats all ill say on that or ill have to be indited for being a huge spoiler there are a ton of special f x but they are done well and are not over bearing in fact they add give the movie its richness i met gene roddenberry when i was in college and was in awe of the man i know in my heart that he would be very proud of this handling of his brain child kudos to j j abrams kurtzman orci for the respect and dignity they continue to give this much loved story the characters who inhabit the world of star trek chris pine zachary quinto shine benedict cumberbatch is truly one of the best villains to come along in years his malevolence charm are a wonder to behold if you breathe have a heart enjoy fantastic movie making at its best this is the movie for you the whole family this definitely is a return visit movie then maybe even another return after that cant wait for the dvd 
ive been a fan since and this is the best of trek ive ever seen just breathtaking and well acted 
this is one of my favorite movies of all time great plot great acting and amazing filming if you like action drama thrillers or any movies at all youll love it i recommend this to everyone 
j j abrams really does know sci fi boys and girls star trek into darkness is excellent the visuals the sound the story and more importantly the realism to the world of star trek into darkness for the most part we have the usual characters comprised of chris pine as captain james kirk zachary quinto as spock he was born to play this character zoe saldana as uhura and karl urban as bones hilarious they all did great there are new additions including a very gorgeous blonde alice eve as carol marcus but the surprise standout performance definitely goes to benedict cumberbatch as john harrison or for you familar trekkies khan he has the eyes the personality the stance and the voice that you would want your villan to have in this movie i expected the sequel to be just enough to be better than the remake but star trek into darkness took what was already good in the reboot and made an even better sequel i am an avid sci fi fan and this is one for the ages in my opinion the story line is good after the first mins of the movie i thought the main focus for the movie would be kirk to prove that he is still worthy to be called captain but it is not the film goes deeper than that but in short it is sensationally terrific my closing remarks for this review will be star wars episode is in excellent hands and without a doubt it will be great and once again star trek into darkness delivers stars

will of hollywood magic and all conveniently laid out for you dear amazon review reader in an easy to interpret format the humble bowling score furthermore the system can be trusted because it literally has nothing to do with actual bowling and isnt that just great for your peace of mind or pom for those into the whole brevity thing now while i have a sort of template i generally use when writing movie reviews when a movie is a true gem and let me assure you this movie is a pure and true gem i have vowed to write a completely new review while the review is a one of a kind the system is not a bowling score of would be considered eh it was ok while a would truly be a good movie one you might recommend to friends now crack and youve got something and by thunder this be one heck of a great popcorn movie star trek into darkness we own the super cool d blu ray with official starfleet phaser version i added a picture to the customer images seriously people if you dont have a d tv get one it seriously ramps up the omg factor and why else would you watch a movie if not for the omg factor whats the movie about ok i am gonna try my best here to give you what you need without spoiling any of the good parts so bear with me here when questionable judgment leads the crew of the enterprise into some oops did i do that kind of trouble prime directive prime smekertive oh wait youre serious jim kirk loses his beloved enterprise and is busted down to commander meanwhile there is trouble afoot when a top secret installation laying hidden in plain sight as a library is blown up in the way to cool for school looking london circa starfleet gathers its best and brightest only to have them blown away at the hands of the mysterious john harrison yup you guessed it the same dude responsible for blowing up the building in london town its up to kirk and crew to put an end to this renegades shenanigans uncover the mystery of section get a good look at j j abrams version of what a klingon looks like and find out what the enterprise is really made of wow trying not to give away anything is not as easy as it would seem people there are some serious twists and turns along the way and at least one oooh mmmy gooodddd moment i had of those myself but individual results may vary why i loved this movie so much lt total popcorn movie action adventure comedy good friends tonight is kind of special sort of movie that keep me going from beginning to end there was no heavy middle of the movie type dialog quagmire the movie just spilled from one scene to the next without slowing down lt the special effects were simply put amazing so often with cgi dependent movies the action on screen comes off as cartoonish at best which can really negate the viewers immersion not the case here i am for positive that the d helped out in this department as space debris littered my living room spears whizzed by my head and you could see to infinity maybe even beyond which really ramped up the feeling that you were genuinely in space lt while it is this movie dudes opinion that the prime directive is simply awesome i mean really how many of the worlds ills could have been avoided if one culture didnt try to change covert or otherwise make better for your own good anyone elses culture gene roddenberry was a true hero and humanitarian way back in the s when he created a show which featured such novel ideas as equality of the races the abolishment of nationalism in favor of a worldview without borders and a hands off to cultural conversions by way of respectful intellectual tolerance lt the blending of old star trek mythos into a new star trek package dude you have no idea how bad i want to just tell you what happens but that would be spoiling the movie for you trust the movie dude here they did just that and they did it well lt the script feature some wonderful interplay between the core characters of kirk spock and uhura which further developed the characters in a significantly more intimate way not previously seen in any other franchise offeringwhy i didnt give the movie a perfect score lt it just missed a perfect score for a few small reasons first the villain in our story while wonderfully acted by benedict cumberbatch say that three times fast with crackers in your mouth true trekkies may stumble on the apparent whitewashing of the character lt i may be alone in this but ever since the terror attacks of hollywood has seemed completely and overtly obsessed with producing films which show the utter annihilation of skyscrapers usually in some dramatic collapse enough is enough already move on to some other disasters will you hollywood will ya beyond that dude i seriously have nothing to complain about the movie had a quick pace a solid if slightly predictable plot all the action and adventure you could shake a stick at which i can shake a stick at quite a lot all the love interests scandals blowing stuff up star ships battling it out and a gratuitous scene with a blond in her underwear one movie dude could ask for kudos to you mr abrams kudos to you hey if you have a question about this review feel free to leave a comment and i will try to answer promptly i will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews bowling for movies is in no way affiliated with amazon nor do i have a website or other business interest im just a dude who watches movies and dabbles in quasi pseudo science want me to review a movie and score it in an amazon review id be happy to if i have it youll get it 
it is rare that you find a sequel that lives up to the hype or expectations of its fans this movie does if you are a fan of the star trek franchise then this movie is a must have for your collection you do not have to be a trekkie to enjoy this action packed adventure cumberbatch was a great addition to star treks already fantastic cast 
ive always been a trekkie my entire life so i went to watch stid last week with of my friends who by the way arent trekkies and omg we were blown away by this movie definitely a great trek and one of the most beautiful movies i ever saw in my life packed with balanced amount of action and science and comedy not to mention the beautiful visual and sound affects this movie caters to all kinds of audience in my opinion the purpose of watching a movie is to to end up with a beautiful pleasant experience and star trek into darkness delivers that the ncc is still boldly going strong even after years cant wait to get those dvds 
as always any movie by jj is going to be a well written thrill ride and into darkness is no exception he rocked the story and the screen play 
first let me begin by simply stating that this is a fantastic movie featuring a well paced and authentic screenplay that takes advantages of the best audio and video production available the movie features a new villain new in the sense those who watch the first movie have not met him before as well as introduces a number of characters and races we know in ways that are believable and fun while at times the movie is predictable the film includes some twists and turns that keep you enjoying the entire ride while some fan favorites may not feature as central a role as one would hope the characters all play an important role in making this a believable environment for those with families this would probably be good for anyone years old or older the movie features some lingerie well sexy underwear and a few instances of profanity s word being the worst obviously whether this movie is appropriate would depend on your family but my personal opinion would be as stated above the audio in the movie is fantastic and features strong low frequency extensions aka will make your subwoofer work when ships go to warp and other events occur which i wont spoil for you the highs are warm and vibrant and not shrill or harsh the sound field envelopes you a few times in a full experience for those with surround sound with phasers firing characters talking and action occurring on all sides overall the dolby hd track on the blu ray would be considered a reference quality audio that is perfect to show off a home theater or to marvel at with your family this is engaging and purposeful sound that truly transforms the experience the video is sharp and crisp in beautiful p blu ray version with saturated colors where appropriate the film benefits from a larger screen as you can get more details and can truly appreciate the scale and work that was put into this but any device will do there is a little bit of film grain the little speckles on the picture which is really only noticeable if looking for it on the darker scenes and in some of the fog like effects throughout the film the camera is very close to the characters showing detail and color but can get a bit much if the constant camera motion bothers you cgi was well done and never appeared fake all of it blended well and felt like part of the set for some viewers you may want to watch this at night or in a room that you can control the light as the sunlight on the tv may wash out some of the blacks causing you to miss some of the detail that can be found in the dark colors and the blacks overall this film is a wonderful experience it will stimulate all of your movie goer senses auditory visual and touch if you have a subwoofer the script is well written nicely paced and albeit predictable at times wholly enjoyable i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sci fi action and great character interaction 
 star trek into darkness is excellent this is how the story goes when the crew of the enterprise is called back home they find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization has detonated the fleet and everything it stands for leaving our world in a state of crisis with a personal score to settle captain kirk leads a manhunt to a war zone world to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction as our heroes are propelled into an epic chess game of life and death love will be challenged friendships will be torn apart and sacrifices must be made for the only family kirk has left his crew the cast led by chris pine as captain james t kirk zachary quinto as commander spock zoe saldana as lieutenant uhura karl urban as dr leonard bones mccoy simon pegg as commander montgomery scotty scott john cho as lieutenant hikaru sulu benedict cumberbatch as john harrison anton yelchin as ensign pavel chekov bruce greenwood as admiral christopher pike peter weller as admiral marcus alice eve dr carol marcus is excellent the directing by j j abrams who also produced is excellent the story screenplay based on the tv series created by gene roddenberry by roberto orci alex kurtzman damon lindelof all three also produced the film as well is excellent the music by michael giacchino is excellent the cinematography by dan mindel is excellent the film editing by maryann brandon mary jo markey is excellent the casting by april webster alyssa weisberg is excellent the production design by scott chambliss is excellent the art direction by alan au ramsey avery steve christensen james clyne kasra farahani natasha gerasimova michael e goldman andrew murdock harry e otto lauren e polizzi jason baldwin stewart is excellent the set decoration by karen manthey set dressings by rich andrade maxwell britton jack cornelius david ladish steven ladish chris larsen michael c magno merdyce mcclaran edward j protiva set designs by lorrie campbell tim croshaw kevin cross robert fechtman tex kadonaga tammy s lee jeff markwith karl j martin sam page anne porter andrew reeder scott schneider easton michael smith randall d wilkins jane wuu is excellent the costume design by michael kaplan is excellent the special make up effects design by david leroy anderson is excellent the creature designs by neville page are excellent the special effects coordinated by j d schwalm supervised by burt dalton is excellent the visual effects coordinated by maren dolzmann thomas furukawa ali ingham perry kain zhunan li mona mohr trina renee cara samuels marlies schacherl adrian steel yinai sun bill wang shanshan xie sarah yunrong yu momo zhan supervised by kevin baillie david burton simon carr urs franzen ben grossmann jorn grobhans alex henning thomas lautenbach sven martin saku partamies jason richardson patric roos benjamin seide michael wortmann is excellent the stunts coordinated by john stoneham jr fights coordinated by marcus young is excellent this is an excellent well made and well crafted thematically and visually movie and sequel that is just as entertaining and interesting as its original possibly better than it this is also another impressive entry in the star trek franchise chris pine zachary quinto among others are back reprising the roles from the original just as well possibly better than the first time benedict cumberbatchs john harrison is an excellent and well done villain right alongside the star trek villains of the past j j abrams has crafted another entertainingly done film that is among one of his best movies of his career beside the last star trek super also another well crafted sequel on abrams resume alongside star trek mission impossible iii ghost protocol this is one of the best movies of the year so far and it is also one of the best movies of the summer season so far as well possibly the best summer movie yet 
first off let me say until this movie i was a star trek lover but for the primetime series back in the s yes i was very young but remember most of those shows always loved the tv show vs the movies until now this is honestly better than their first movie it honestly seems as if they are getting better with each movie how many franchises can say that then again that is just my opinion take it or leave it 
star trek was awesome and spectacular but close to its original of star trek the cast especially cumberbatch as khan was awesome funny and brutally serious action is fun to watch it always makes sure humor and emotion is involvedduring any course of action i cannot wait to get my hands on this blu ray whenever it comes out probably afterthe summer too bad my wife does not like science fiction but hey i lovethe younger version of star trek it works like a charm even though the oldstar trek movies werent all that bad live long and prosper highly recommended to watch and own this wonderfulpiece of filmmaking history 
ive been a casual fan of star trek for years i went into this with an open mind and no expectations what i walked out with was a smile on my face and a lot of warm memories as i tried to piece together the changes used to create this alternate timeline while still respecting the original id call this movie a success on every level its well written well acted and pays homage to its roots respectfully on another note my girlfriend has never watched star trek in her life prior to the first jj abrams star trek which i talked her into watching on dvd so into darkness is only her second star trek experience she has thoroughly enjoyed both movies and after into darkness shes now asked if we can start collecting the original series so she can watch everything from the beginning in order i now have an excuse to buy all of the tv series i already have all the movies this movie has satisfied an old fan and helped create a new one i dont think i could give it any higher praise than that so i wont even bother trying 
saw this times in theaters and that wasnt enough the best movie of the year by far the first one was great but this one blew it out of the water it was perfect in every way chris pine and zachary quinto were outstanding benedict cumberbatch is always flawless and always amazing he was beyond that in the movie heartbreaking heartwarming hysterical and all around perfect 
i thoroughly enjoyed the first star trek starring chris pine his character of a young capt james t kirk was spot on as well as zachary quintos portrayal of young mr spock usually sequels arent all that good however there are exceptions and this one was its was exciting thrilling suspenseful dramatic and some comedy wrapped into one movie i would recommend seeing the first star trek with chris pine first and definitely get this sequel 
sequels are never as good as the original movie and up until into darkness i really hadnt seen one be as good as its predecessor this movie blew me away from the beginning until the end i was riveted to my seat waiting for the next reveal to occur i am not a star trek fan and only started watching after j j abrams made the first one but for me as a newcomer to this franchise this movie was just fantastic the plot was interesting and easy to follow some of the action was a little over the top at times but then again you are in outer space so i guess anything goes and the camaraderie between the main characters was very fun to watch a couple of laughs and growth for kirks and spocks character made it very enjoyable as well benedict cumberbatch was just amazing in his role of villain and had me guessing if he actually was the bad guy after all i am hopeful there will be more movies to follow that are as good as this one 
j j abrams lost super hit this one out of the park because star trek was an amazingly good character driven and origin story film filled with good drama some comedy and some action star trek into darkness is literally a visual roller coaster of action and fun the d is effective in this film and more importantly the action and suspense does not stop at all roberto orci and alex kurtzman both on transformers and fringe along with damon lindelof prometheus lost to the story to the next level and the stakes are much higher in this film literally watching this film was also an experience of audience participation with cheers tears fears applause and even oooos and ahhhhs and tons of laughter laughter and hysterics throughout most of movie what i really liked about the movie is that once again it took the original series concepts and turned them upside down and twisted them and made them fresh some familiar and yet not familiar moments do occur and you have to see it to understand what i mean what also received a warm applause at the end of the film from the entire audience was a proud dedication the filmmakers give to the post veterans giving them thanks and praise for their past and present service at home and abroad chris pine rise of the guardians this means war does the comedy just as well as he does the drama and his passion for the role is clear with his wild james t kirk agenda which often isnt exactly what starfleet would approve zachary quinto heroes margin call does an incredible spock once again his passionless persona is passion ful and his commitment to subtlety conveying meaning without saying a word is amazing the chemistry between chris and zach is blissfully apparent on screen and their compassion for each other as starfleet officers is fully developed in this filmkarl urban dred bourne supremacy is the cantankerous bones mccoy and karl is having an amazing time with this in this film his charm is burning through his bitterness and sarcasm throughout the film zoe saldana avatar columbiana as uhura really gets to shine in this film as her relationship with spock is tested and it happens in some very funny scenes between their domestic arguments they have and they have them in front of kirk i waited till now to discuss the story and i dont want to give any spoilers away but the plot centers around why the film was dedicated to who it was dedicated to in the first place benedict cumberbatch warhorse sherlock plays a villain that would rival most villains mean sadistic relentless and extremely intelligent all the elements you do not want a madman to have and he has got them in spades he is a terrorist who affects kirk in a very personal way that causes kirk to make his entire mission to get benedicts character and i am avoiding his name for a reason its a real terrorist story did i mention that simon pegg shaun of the dead hot fuzz playing chief engineer scott is one of the funniest things youll ever see on screen in this film even when he resigns oooops tiny spoiler or maybe not youll see john cho american beauty harold kumar has an amazing moment of power when he gets an unexpected upgrade and john plays it to the hilt and even has a moment that impresses himself quite a bit the one who has the least amount to do yet some very funny moments and one truly heroic moment is anton yelchin fright night terminator salvation as chekov he literally fixes and saves and fixes and saves you have to see it for yourself another brilliant performance by the father figure bruce greenwood i robot dejavu as captain pike sole cheerleader for captain kirk and all his troublesome antics bruce and chris also have amazing chemistry as the surrogate father and son relationship that they have developed and joining the cast this time around is alice eve men in balck iii the raven as carol marcus a specialist in a field that defiantly helps in the hunt for benedicts character as well as unexpectedly helping benedict as well now ad an admiral with a mission and a twist or two or three that will very much surprise you and you have you wondering at all times is peter weller robocop buckaroo bonzai adding to the mix of extremely high energy and fast pace and there is a really big surprise too everyone is back and in full form and full force and this is definitely a candy film for the soul take the drama and passion of the first film sprinkle in some suspense plot twists a double extra helping of humor and scene by scene action on top of action on top of action on top of action and you have star trek into darkness a film that will literally have something for everyone of all ages to enjoy and you will definitely feel much better leaving the theatre then when you came in as spock always says live long and prosper 
i have been a star trek fan all my life but with the last movies ive had enough of star trek forever until mr genius abrams reimagined it from a better perspective its not about who is smarter than the villain spock scotty or kirk its about who has the best gadgets and the best hard bodies even the oyster face man was hilarious one word star trek into the darkness is badar e one of the reasons star trek died in the s is because the cast became aged star trek is for young people and it made me feel young again this star trek got a huge face lift and i love it complete with toys and all to be honest about what killed it for me in the s was the constant klingon crap the part where abrams introduces a super enterprise is just jaw dropping i was all over that saying holy cow star fleet admiral kicks butt he pawned kirk i totally enjoyed seeing captain kirk get all teary eyed begging the admiral for another chance there is a scene where the admirals daughter pops into the picture and you say is that her then you all of a sudden remember kirk had a son the love affairs with the o hoorah was funny and the new kirk makes fun of it which elicites a laugh from me i need laughs from st i must say the ending was a shocker no wonder kirk was superior im preordering d blu ray dvd digital right now i cant wait for this to get on my private big screen in d i hope st will explain the rest of kirks early life 
i never was a star trek fan until the franchise was renewed in with j j abrams a head star trek into darkness is a really brilliant sci fi movie and is full of action complemented with the tremendous acting of the entire cast and maybe just for me it was very fresh and unexpected in many ways because i didnt watch the old franchise but i always heard about khan and i never imagine that this character will be so intimidating that made you feel that way im really satisfied with this movie and for the excellent work of j j abrams that put this one to the top of movies of this year so over iron man and over fast and furious too i only think this one could be down from the first place with man of steel which nolan helps write and thats a lot to say 
im a mediocre trekkie not diehard but i do love the old series and original cast movies this movie is equal fave with star trek and the new team of writers and director really get the essence of the original show 
this is my nd review of a movie on amazon i must admit i did order and still have on order the d dvd but when i saw this was available on instant video on amazon well i ordered that one too haha here is my review plot the plot was excellent and it wasnt too obvious the bad guys name remained nameless to me until just before he identified himself it wasnt so soon as to make the movie any less exciting than it was the plot did take a dangerous theme from trek history one that for us trek followers could have been disastrous if not done perfectly some trek followers might even consider it movie blasphemy i admit there were a few seconds that i thought they had crossed the line but it wasnt a few more seconds later where a tear welled up in my eye and was proof to me that it was done well yes they did it right im sure the director jj abrams was sweating bullets the whole time action all sci fi movies should have a lot of action and star trek is no exception this movie had all of that and it did keep me guessing about what was next there is no shortage of action in this movie none and the special effects supported the action from the enterprise shuttles volcanoes alien worlds to things that go boom smash and crash its an eye popping ear ringing action adventure movie that just so happens to be in the future acting i rather like that the actor zachary quinto that plays spock gained some weight from the last star trek movie my guess would be about lbs he wears it well and acted true albeit slightly out of bounds from his historical character but i suppose that was the point anyways since the last movie changed history right chris pine who played james tiberius kirk every time i think of his full name i think of the first movie where the year old version says it high pitched did an excellent job again the not so confident kirk is humbled to death in this one and that too is a turn from the historical version everyone else was excellent too however i did think the tribble was a little out of uniform since when was there ever a short hair version ok wait i have the answer since history itself changed ok ok so if you are a follower of trek you will not be disappointed if this is the first time seeing a trek movie youll be better than fine as long as you like sci fi action and good vs evil have fun i did 
this review is based on having watched the film at home with my family on blu ray star trek into darkness is the sequel to director j j abrams film version of star trek dvd and both are set at about the same time as or slightly earlier than the original series but in an alternative timeline im not going to explain more than that because to do so would be a spoiler for the previous film and star trek into darkness works best if you have previously watched abrams first offering abrams said that the idea now that we are in an independent timeline allows us to use any of the ingredients from the past or come up with brand new ones to make potential stories he does that many times in this film which includes a lot of references to the most popular features and characters from the original tv episodes from the kirk picard voiceover during the title sequence to tribbles but you dont have to be a massive star trek fan to enjoy it i would advise against looking up the cast list on the internet before watching the film because this would give away the identity of the first villain which was such a closely guarded secret before the film came out that even benedict cumberbatch who performs the part brilliantly was not told who he was playing until a week after he was cast i say the first villain because there are more than two sides to the conflict and it is not at all obvious at first who the bad guys are there is some element of sympathetic parody of the original series which perhaps can be best illustrated by two quotes from this film at one point kirk chris pine tells his away team dont set your phasers to stun theirs certainly wont be which rather reminds one of the line attributed to his tos character in a comic song we come in peace shoot to kill on another occasion dr mccoy karl urban asks kirk tell me are you feeling homicidal power mad despotic kirk replies no more than usual zachary quinto is magnificent as spock leonard nimoy has a brief cameo as spocks older self pine and urban are equally brilliant as kirk and mccoy while zoe saldana makes a convincing uhura and simon pegg is an excellent scotty it grates slightly that his accent is from a different part of scotland than james doohans was but never mind special effects are of course superb with the enterprise managing both to look true to the sixties original and like a magnificently sophisticated creation of the twenty third century the film delivers non stop action and excitement and anyone who is at all into science fiction is very likely to enjoy it 
director jj abrams writers roberto orci alex kurtzman and damon lindelof starring chris pine zachary quinto zoe saldana karl urban simon pegg john cho anton yelchin bruce greenwood benedict cumberbatch alice eve and peter weller running time minutes rated pg for intense sequences of sci fi action and violence theres something i really enjoy about jj abrams style of filmmaking yes its flashy and fast and it may come off as a bit shallow but theres something about it that gives off a spark that really gets me engaged he can get establish a lot within the first to minutes of a movie which would take most filmmakers quite a while to build up everything from the big action scenes to the core characters and their motivations to what they do he knows exactly what hes doing behind the camera a prime example of this would be when he did super within a half hour we know just about the entire cast what the kids are doing in the movie the big awesome train crash that was so publicized happens and it happens at full force and it never feels like its overstuffing its self which brings us to his take on the much loved star trek franchise these films of his really cause some weird reactions with people they make nice amounts of money and get excellent reviews from critics but if you went to a random forum on the cesspit that is the internet youd probably find the opposite reaction almost like as if abrams and co spat in the face of everyones mother and other relatives personally i actually really liked hell maybe even loved his reboot of the trek franchise great visuals excellent chemistry fun dialogue fast paced awesome music it did a lot of things right even if the plot was a bit confusing with the alternate universes black holes and what not something that puzzles the hell out of me is why did the sequel into darkness take so long i know abrams was busy with super but maybe he should have put that off as much as i love that film in favor of doing this it probably would be doing better business at the box office and critics than it is doing now now in the event you are wondering if im attacking the film or am going to spew out negative thoughts on the film lets get this out of the way im not while into darkness certainly has its problems and well get to those latter its a worthy sequel to the original and one of the most entertaining things ive seen this year it still has all the elements i loved from the original with a few new things thrown in set a few years after the original the federation has come under attack from a terrorist by the name of john harrison benedict cumberbatch a former starfleet officer out for revenge after he felt that star command screwed him over in the worst ways possible the crew of the enterprise led of course by kirk n spock chris pine and zachary quinto respectively are sent in to take him down by orders of one admiral marcus peter weller but while the plot may seem simple things are not as they seem i feel the need to get the bad stuff out of the way first like in the same way a bratty child is forced to eat his vegetables before he can get to the good stuff one of my main complaints of the film is that i feel it goes on for far too long while abramss previous films have sported great pacing into darkness kind of mess up a bit theres filler in the movie that could have been seriously cut out and it would have been all the better for it like bits where good ol scotty simon pegg gets drunk off his ass or the bar scene between kirk and commander pike bruce greenwood and yes i know its done to show their father son like relationship but it came off as forced another thing that film does that bothers me is that it suffers from being unpredictable to predictable theres some twists that caught me off guard but theres some stuff that can be seen a mile away i think it may have to do with the fact that it had screenwriters doing it the first two being the scribes from the previous film roberto orci and alex kurtzman while the third scribe was divisive prometheus and lost writer damon lindelof i always get this weird feeling like whenever mr linelof is involved the product always ends up spawning weird reactions with people eh moving on as for the good stuff for the film a lot of the things that made the first film great are still here the visual effects and set design are better than ever ranging from seeing things like an incredible fight in hyper space in which we see all sorts of people flying out of the hull as things explode left and right to the now famous scene in the trailers and advertisements where we see a starfleet cruiser crash into a sprawling metropolis michael giacchinos score is still nothing short of incredible bringing out some true excitement and wonderment to the universe and some of the music is bound to get stuck in your head after its all over the performances across the board are quite good as well chris pine and zachary quinto continue to show they have their characters down pat and never ceases to stop being amusing from watching them be bros one moment to bickering about the rules and personal approaches to how the current mission on hand should be accomplished or how karl urban who will always be judge dredd in my mind from now on thanks to to the excellent adaptation continues to be the best replacement for bones mccoy with his quips and grumpy attitude while some have had problems with the character of dr carol marcus a doctor who pops up on the enterprise under a different name dont worry no spoilers and her actress alice eve i never really had a problem with her i thought she did well with the material that was given to her especially her scenes between her and bones but special mention must go to benedict cumberbatch as harrison charismatic intimidating fierce and methodical are just the few words to describe his villain one moment you can go from being fascinated and even wanting to see him defeated to feeling incredibly sorry for the guy quite a performance here hes a true threat and makes the villain of the previous film nero eric bana look like a chump no disrespect to mr bana who played a very fun and dangerous villain but you look like old stuff compared to cumberbatch kinda funny how the guy who has a ship with the ability to create black holes looks less threatening than one man with superpowers one might ask me is into darkness better than the original i cannot say no as due to the problems ive mentioned here that were not or at least werent as big in the reboot star trek was incredibly fresh at the time and sadly with this some if only a little of the polish has come off but thats only minor both films are pretty much on the same plane with darkness coming up just a tad short into darkness is bound to piss people off as with most sacred works in nerdom like whatever joss whedon pumps out or live action adaptations of anime which always almost suck but even with the problems that the film has theres still a lot to like here if you can get past the pacing issues and the predictability of the film youre in for one fun summer movie now that all that is said and done two questions remain how will abrams take on star wars turn out and what will paramount do with the next film in the trek franchise ive got high hopes for his take on sw but im not sure what to think the next trek film will turn out i just hope they get someone whos just as confident and energetic as abrams is 
whomever does not like this movie should be sent to an african refugee camp and have to wake up each morning to a bucket of pig slop splashed on their face for the rest of their lives raising honey badgers
i dont know what the critics were saying in their preliminary reviews i loved this film from start to finish and am looking forward to the next installment as the whole universe changed when nero attacked kirks fathers ship in the first film and that vulcan was wiped out one cannot expect that these movies should follow anything that the original series and movies did and because of the way spock felt his race die he will certainly have more human emotional outbursts at times it is only logical when the movie starts the enterprise is on one of their first missions and two things go wrong namely spock needs rescuing and in doing so the enterprise makes itself visible to a primitive group of people this violates the prime directive of non interference in developing cultures when was this ever a big deal in the original series all they did was interfere kirk does not record anything in the ships log but spock does because he cant lie if you remember taggart in the beverly hills cop movie you will have an idea how this will play out later kirk is briefly demoted and told to report back to starfleet academy for remedial training i was wondering if he was going to meet up with finnegan this lasts until a terrorist attack on london wipes out a bunch of senior starfleet officers kirk is told to get the terrorist harrison who goes by another name that us oldtimers know well who has hidden himself in the vulcan sector of space by admiral marcus the movie moves at breakneck speed as the enterprise goes to bring back harrison despite the lovers spat that is going on between spock and uhura mr scott seems to be on the out with kirk and after an argument quits the enterprise and mr chekov has to get engineering up to speed the character that steals the movie is mccoy the new mccoy goes overboard with spewing cliches that would make deforest kelly proud to the point of getting on kirks nerves he is also worried about kirks health and will pick the wrong times to examine him note possible spoiler there is a brief mention of having to take care of mudds ship so of course we will see a familiar furry friend make an appearence i really hope that abrams will continue with a third installment of this film if this film is any indication then the star wars franchise is in good hands 
i can understand the disdain many have with the rebooting of star trek many people feel as though j j abrams has taken the films into a direction away from the original star trek i on the other hand love the two movies he has released the casting is spot on and it isnt about constant fighting and explosions into darkness took me by surprise and im sure others will be surprised as well im looking forward to the next installment 
all the positive reviews here are true i was a little concerned that this one would veer off into more parallels like the reboot however j j abrams has kept the integrity of the tos the s films intact some liberties were taken with the klingons but not by much if you have seen enterprises th season then the klingons appearance wont be too surprising there isnt much i can say that others havent already said except to say that everyone portrays these classic characters to perfection leonard nimoys cameo was great alice eve definately looks like a younger carol marcus no doubt benedict cumbarach definately has a famous villians mannerism down karl urban definately reminds you of mccoy kirk spock are in perfect form i was convinced this time that chris pine was a younger william shatner the brash charm was there i was a bit disappointed that him carol marcus didnt flirt more after all they are destined to be lovers the parents of david as seen in star trek ii wrath of kahn but then again the pacing of this one didnt allow a romance to blossom even though it is an alternate reality the attraction would still be there overall this one i think is the best one since the wrath of kahn maybe even better somthing i thought i would never hear myself say despite being an alternate reality the ending defiantely seems to predate elements of the s show s films as if there is no alternate reality which surprised me overall this one is one of the best trek films ever made 
although im a casual fan of the star trek series i highly recommend this film it is a combination of excitement thrill fun and a little sadness dont want to spoil it many people assume that you have to be a hardcore star trek fan in order to love this film im here to tell you thats absolutely false its an easy film to watch with friends and families j j abrams does a great job interpreting this film i thought the first film was great but i loved into darkness even more i was a little skeptical at first when i found out that cumberbatch was the villain dont get me wrong i love cumberbatch as an actor sherlock holmes but ive only known him as a protagonist boy was i wrong he did a great job making his character john harrison khan believable he wasnt the typical cheesy villain some of us are accustomed to pine and quinto did a great job reprising their roles and their character development together all in all its a fun film that will not disappoint must see film 
im so glad that i saw this movie on the big screen in my opinion action movies are best seen on big screens star trek had lots of good action the suspense and comedy was great chris pine and zachary quinto still have a good bro chemistry they also brought a good laugh and some seriousness in between all the fighting i just thought there was a little too much fighting that it started to feel overdone thats why i felt i couldnt give it a full stars i liked simon pegg as scotty i felt his attempts to comedy was genuine and i know that benedict cumberbatch played the villain but i liked him the most in this movie i loved loved loved that the j paul getty museum is the starfleet headquarters i went to that museum about years ago but recognized it instantly 
i really enjoyed this movie the cast has great chemistry and i enjoyed the quirkiness included in the dialogue spock was great fighting against khan i was not disappointed i recommended it to my dad and he purchased the dvd and enjoyed as well as my mom i hope there is another one coming 
better than the first one altho the storyline follows the first in the twisting the original movies it does great in filling in gaps previously left open in original 
my wife and i saw into darkness and loved it and she is not a big sci fi st fan this movie has it all great story with great acting action drama suspense comedy andan awesome soundtrack there are moments that make you laugh and then those that will bring a tear to your eye if you are a long time st fan like me going back to tos youll appreciate many of the little things laced throughout this film if you are a newbie to the st universe youll still love this movie ill be going to a second theater viewing then waiting impatiently for the dvd 
the new direction jj abrahms has taken the roddenberry crew is phenominal no spoilers here but this is one star trek that i find the nemesis highly entertaining if not likeable this is a must see if youre a treke and even if youre not its still a great movie have seen several times and keep catching some important info i missed the movie that keeps giving 
basically after seeing this movie i just want to throw money at j j abrams and watch the happy come out as every other review says he does a great job of maintaining the feeling of the original star trek yet with fun exciting and honestly better told versions of the stories all us trekkies have grown to love i cannot wait to see what he does with star wars 
if youre a trekkie youll really love this movie especially if you followed the older tv series without giving everything away you should watch the wrath of kahn old movie before watching this your understanding of the references will enhance your movie experience if you do as always jj abrams does a wonderful job directing next time you can cut down on the glare effects jj and you are the wizard at camera shaking 
the short featuring a strong and incredibly dynamic cast that is both well acted and written a grandeur of delicious special effects and an incredible sense of pacing to match the first jj abrams returns with into darkness only to nearly out do himself ah the summer movie season the time when we are blown away by grand demonstrations of digital artists loud and booming explosions and silly excuses for characters and story thrown into the mix its a summer movie clich eacute one that is fun yet unfulfilling you could be easily skeptical of the sequel to one of s best films star trek but have no fear jj abrams is back in action into darkness has come early in the summer movie season but im sure it is going to be a favorite pick for most movie goers and also trek fans for me its definitely going to be one of the summer blockbusters to judge all others simply because it does nearly everything right returning with a phenomenal cast into darkness goes for a more character driven piece this time which succeeds in almost every way the whole cast from kirk to spock pine and quinto scotty to chekov pegg and yelchin i could go on and on the whole cast rocks dashes of great humor and stupendous writing are the strong points here with each and every character having their shining moment cumberbatch our villain this time around is also fantastic featuring an intense and believable performance that doesnt feel clich eacute or silly above all else one of my favorites scotty gets plenty of screen time and steals the show in nearly every scene its only some of the newer faces on the enterprise are simply there but its cool to see so many different characters get a chance in the limelight the character driven story couldve fallen apart but gladly the characters are written even better this time around and are heroes youll want to root for the story of into darkness is nothing new but its far from boring and dull featuring some interesting twists and incredible action set pieces the story told is one that couldve easily been rudimentary but is instead smart and exciting while the plot of the original is a little thrown in there the plot here is more essential to the experience its just a little less original there are a couple of plot holes mainly when getting closer to the ending but it doesnt distract it simply and sadly mars an incredible experience the visual effects wizards that abrams commands are also back with some incredibly delicious results ships look gorgeous phasers and guns look vibrant and cool and the action sequences are fantastic abrams trademark style shines here too with some sequences that are pretty simple but are shot in such fantastically cool ways that its impossible not to be glued to your seat there are also some simply gorgeous shots from great use of rack focusing and quick zooms to create a sense of realism in even the most cgi enhanced scenes the soundtrack composed by the wonderful michael giacchino is perfect the theme is incredible khans theme is excellent and the booming percussion will get your blood pumping the sound effects are loud and in your face but you also never lose the intimacy of an important dialogue moment its edited to perfection in theaters its only a couple of plot holes and the lack of freshness that made the original so incredible that keeps into darkness just shy of greatness its the characters and thrilling story that keeps you glued to your chair which arguably is more important and thus makes into darkness the superior entry in the series as for now into darkness is a truly spectacular nd act for the enterprise and crew one that takes their relationships to the breaking point and truly tests both the cast and abrams once again to return and try top themselves once again into darkness doesnt boldly go where no film has gone before but it is surely one of the most solid sequels that hollywood has dished out in recent memory but ill stand by this what a fantastic way to begin the summer movie season 
i recommend this movie to everyone you dont have to be a trekkie to like this movie i never miss any star trek movie or tv show and feel that chris pine and the rest of the new crew of the enterprise are perfect in their roles zakary quinto and carl urban have nailed their roles as spock and bones and all the rest are equally good benedict cumberbatch was an excellent kahn truly bringing that character to life excellent movie on all fronts 
if yuo like action movies and know something about star trek this is a movie you must see it has a lot of action drama and adveture and must of all excelent special efects maybe it is not a movie for women but if you are an action guy you must see this movie seated at your favorite chair with a good beer and nachos 
i saw this movie in theaters and thought it was great but when i saw it again on blu ray it blew my mind great acting great story twists and special effects well worth the purchase to add to the collection plus it comes with a digital copy to throw on the tablet for a flight or camping trip
this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie as follows movie video audio simply put super exciting movie excellent video and rocking audio a must have for your collection hands down this blu ray disc is a great demo disc for your home theater system cant wait for the next installment in this series j j is a super director andi hope he continues to direct all future movies in this series hats off to him 
this is a fantastic movie it captured the essence of the characters personalities in the original tv series sometimes would forget this wasnt those guys they sound and act like them that much the plot even reminded me of the ones in the old tv series combined with the special effects and you have a winner i advise you see it in d for it is visually stunning stars
wonderful i am a huge star trek fan and trekkie so of course after seeing in the theatre i had to add it to my collection ive watched it several times since and enjoy it every time 
blu ray picture quality was excellent i liked the story lots of action multiple bad guys very entertaining movie i am a big star trek fan and this is one of the best movies in the series 
this was a great sci fi movie and a great star trek film in general lots of action plenty of humor surprises emotion and a brilliant twist to one of the classic star trek films after a mission has gone bad captain james kirk is demoted to first officer of the enterprise with his predecessor admiral christopher pike reassuming command when starfleet is attacked by john harrison kirk and his crew journey to a klingon planet in search for harrison what follows is an all out war with harrison the klingons and a rogue admiral if youre a trekkie i highly recommend star trek into darkness 
to clarify all articles published to date claim that the single disc dvd only edition contains no special features the blu ray and dvd as well as the d blu ray and dvd combo packs will contain featurettes but from what i have read they will be on the blu ray disc and the dvd disc will be the same single disc in the dvd only pack with no features the blu ray features as noted in press releases are listed as creating the red planet a featurette about the creation of the red planet so basically a special effects featurette attack on starfleet the effects and filming of the attack on starfleet headquarters the klingon home world kronos featurette the enemy of my enemy spoiler alert its about the bad guy ship to ship the space suits only flight jump of you know who and kirk brawl by the bay the brawl by the bay spock and you know who continuing the mission on the continuation the sequel the story after the first trek probably similar to the first featurette on the star trek two disc dvd set from it is a shame but there does not as of yet appear to be a two disc dvd only edition for people who dont see well enough to bother with blu ray or people like me who think film is far more and please pardon the use of such a stupid word magical when it is ever so slightly fuzzy and you cant actually see the pores on mens noses if you want features paramount wants you to buy a blu ray player and kill that hazy cloudy magic of slightly foggy film stock with a bunch of high definition bull in order to see those features the decision is yours 
the gift of a new time line given in the most recent version of star trek is apparently going to be milked for all it is worth here we have the reshaped story of khan and what he did to our beloved enterprise crew though i admit the new crew is less dignified and military minded than the original series and its movies and spin offs the changes initiated by the previous movies story can explain it mind you my take on the result would have been a more disciplined military state but you cant have everything you want i actually like the more extreme entertainment levels we get with the resulting characters and their crazy antics if you havent seen star trek from see that first to re orient yourself to the newer vision if you have seen it and liked it you will most likely benefit from a reckless dive into the sequel into darkness go get it 
this movie gave the feeling of comradery we would experience in the original star trek something i did not feel in the first one true there are many differences that gene might not be so happy about there is a greater feel of action and daring as well as fly by the seat of your pants in jj abrahms star trek with genes star trek there was a greater need to think and use ones brains before brawn here is quite the opposite now dont get me wrong i loved this movie from star to finish but there were things i had many issues with i have been blasted for spoilers in the past so i wont go into the details but needless to say if you are expecting shatners james tiberius kirk you wont find him here though quintos spock in my opinion is dead on he plays spock perfectly while i love the new scotty he is no where near the scotty we all knew and loved played by james doohan i am already ordering this so that i can watch it again and again i highly recommend this film to anyone who likes the star trek universe different as it may be or just likes plain action science fiction spoiler alert i will say that we get to see a whole new take on many aspects of the original star trek for instance this movie has khan noonian sing remember him along with modified yet again klingons and a very inspiring yet i felt ripped off death sequence towards the end with some roll reversal i dont want to give away anymore of the story so i had to erase what i just typed you will also get to see a lovers quarrel sort of between uhura and spock very interesting take on vulcan emotions spoiler alert over listen see the movie youll be glad you did then you will want to come right back to amazon com and buy it i guarantee it its just that good ralph j fitcher a lifelong star trek fan 
satirical emotional and epic are the only words to describe the new movie star trek into darkness i got a chance to visit the paramount lot for an exclusive screening of this movie which left me in awe and thrill although this movie is a sequel to the previous star trek series movie goers who are not familiar with the story will understand the plot clearly the actors portray their characters very well thanks to the director j j abrams the scenery and set for the futuristic year of are so vivid and realistic audience members will forget they are in the year this movie is also produced for the imax d which puts all the explosions and fight scenes in your face the relationship of all the characters on the iconic starship enterprise are deep and meaningful captain kirk chris pine and spock zachery quinto develop a brotherly love through the struggles they conquer the villain khan benedict cumberpatch is a scary two faced character that will leave the audience guessing his fate until the very end not only does the main star achieve his role prefectly but the co stars also do an superb job the writers roberto orci alex kurtzman and damon lindelof successfully add comedy in the script to bring an emotional roller coaster to the audience the set ranges from modern skyscrapers to futuristic spaceships the designers portrayed the theme very well using many computer generated images to create the year of in a way that makes it seem so real the d element is an added bonus because it brings the action up close the beginning scene has lots of running and fighting sequences and yet it is all filmed in such detail that the characters seem like they are going to run off screen after watching this movie my passion for star trek has been sparked i rate this movie out of because it balances the comedy and action scenes so well it has multiple themes taking place but the on going theme the power of friendship can build you or destroy you is present throughout this movie contains a hand full of violence but is not bloody or graphic the action sequences violence and realistic make up could be scary for younger audience members so i recommend this for ages to this movie has sparked an interest in star trek for me and hopefully it will do the same to you reviewed by patrick n kids first film critic video review available at kidsfirst org
it was really good i could watch star trek movies jj abrams has brought magic to this series how about the borg in the next one 
i love this new line of star trek movies reinventing the orginal cast from the original star trek tv series is a brillant idea check it out 
spoiler alert spoiler alert you have been warned others have detailed the plot specifics so i will go with my own perspective as a lifelong star trek fan who started watching tos in syndicated rerun in the mid s star trek ii the wrath of khan is my favorite star trek movie by far and it is in my list of the top films of all time so i was a bit concerned when i read the rumors on the internet that cumberbatch was going to reprise this iconic science fiction role in star trek into darkness i felt that jj company needed to do something different since they had created an alternate timeline with the first movie i think the writing team had given lots of thought of parallel universes and how certain points and people are fixed in time in all possible universes the work they did on fringe pushed them to do several seasons worth of story about an alternate universe peter was their fixed person in the fringe universe who impacted both realities the writers looked at khan the same way i had to think about the plot threads of terrorism betrayal security revenge optimism family and trust that were weaved through into darkness after seeing it wednesday night i then read the novelization and the prequel graphic novel to gain a better perspective before i went and watched the movie again today the main themes hit by this story are many such as kirk being too young impetuous inexperienced undisciplined egotistical etc to command a starship effectively spock still suffering emotionally from the traumatic loss of his home world and his mother while trying to connect with his erratic emotional impulsive captain starfleet command reacting badly to the devastating terror attack by nero against vulcan and starfleet in the previous film causing starfleet command to turn to extraordinary extra legal actions to bring security to the federation despite undermining the very freedoms and ethics espoused by the federation section scotty being the one crew member besides spock willing to take a moral stand with kirk over crossing the line of legality and ethics while kirk starfleet are preoccupied with revenge against khan so to me this wasnt a rehash of wrath of khan because that story was about coming to terms with growing older and feeling that life had passed you by kirks past comes back to haunt him and the enterprise and kirk finally had to face his own kobyashi maru test with spocks sacrifice khan was motivated by his need for vengeance against kirk over the loss of his wife and being left marooned on a doomed planet this too was an issue from khans past he could not let go and it was his undoing st id is about surviving the viccitudes of youth and learning from your mistakes to mature into a better sentient being connected to your friends and society kirk had pike to place his faith and trust in him even when kirk had royally screwed up from the hubris of flagrantly violating the prime directive on nibiru even as kirk failed to recognize this error it took pikes death and the pursuit of khan to bring kirk to the realization that he had to change his worldview and behavior spock was struggling with his inner demons over the loss of vulcan and his mother he also made a personal journey of self discovery in st id especially after kirk sacrificed himself to save the ship spock is filled with rage and pursues khan with a fury never seen before he helps save his friend jim kirk and he can now acknowledge this friendship and let it evolve starfleet command reacted like the us did after they undermined their own principles in the name of imagined security admiral marcus had sent out ships looking for resources to help starfleet defend the federation and they found the botany bay admiral marcus thought he could exploit khans genetically engineered superior intellect and his capacity for violence to give the clandestine section think cia homeland security special forces an advantage in building a capacity to take on the biggest perceived threat to the federation for admiral marcus the klingon empire thus you get the top secret special prototype photon torpedoes and the built for combat uss vengeance along with who knows what else that didnt get mentioned you get incidents manipulated to provoke a state of war with the klingons all justified in the name of security scotty was just awesome in this story he was a moral compass while getting in on the action with the sabotage of the uss vengeance he also got some more great comedic scenes and lines i was a bit disappointed that bones didnt get more involved in this story but since it involved more technological issues i can see why scotty was used rather than mccoy bones still got in some great metaphors and scenes and you know he can deliver gorn babies in a crisis situation sulu gets a taste of the command chair and checkov gets to flex his savant genius abilities as scottys replacement temporarily as chief engineer uhura has some issues with spock talks up some klingons battles some klingons makes some tough long distance calls getting a young carol marcus was cool and they didnt force her to be romantically involved with kirk she gets to join the crew and maybe they will hook up in the next installment the big e gets a refit to repair her battle damage and the crew of the uss enterprise embark on the start of what should be an eventful glorious and historic five year mission to boldly go where no one has gone before so i give into darkness a out of my biggest issue was with how long it took to warp to kronos and then back to earth unless warp speed had improved by a factor of over the old star trek this was a plot device that was just way out of step with the rest of the movie so other than that i am cool with the rest of the film elements as they were explained by the prequel graphic novel and in the novelization book for the film i look forward to star trek to come out in may of to be a part of the celebration of the th anniversary of star trek dvd release addendum i was really excited about the blu ray release of into darkness i had read about the multitude of extras that jj abrams and his team shot for inclusion with the blu ray that would be exciting for the fans apparently the good folks in the marketing department at paramount took a look at this treasure of bonus material and saw a way to extort the fans for even more profit they struck deals to parcel out these bonus features to different retailers forcing fans to buy a plethora of copies to collect all of the bonus features i didnt cancel my order because this isnt amazons fault and i do want the awesome phaser i wont be buying these extra copies to line paramounts pockets full of gold pressed latinum actually if paramount had an ounce of integrity they would make a public apology for trying to screw over the fans of star trek who have made them profits that would make a ferengi blush and offer a blu ray disc with the bonus material to make up for this error in judgement the website digital bits is where i was alerted to this shameful avarice it stated the following yes the seven featurettes listed in the press release are basically everything you get on the disc aside from the usual dvd copy digital copy ultraviolet copy xerox copy and what not the featurettes amount to about minutes of epk style behind the scenes material theres no commentary no deleted scenes no trailers which would be bad enough except it turns out that more extras were created for this release more featurettes and even an audio commentary with director j j abrams and members of his crew none of it is available on the wide release blu ray or blu ray d skus the commentary can only be found as an itunes extra download and those extra featurettes some are on a target bonus disc some are on a best buy bonus disc and some are only available via cinemanow and vudu downloads thats right more than half of the special features created for star trek into darkness were used by paramounts marketing team as retailer exclusives its a terrible way to treat your consumers who are sometimes spending or more for a blu ray expecting to get a little genuine value for their money and no six different versions of the exact same movie isnt value if youre a serious blu ray enthusiast or for that matter a star trek fan of any kind all you care about when you buy a blu ray is getting the movie in pristine quality with lots of extras though its a v quality is exceptional in all other respects the star trek into darkness blu ray is an insult to see the entire column visit www thedigitalbits com columns my two cents 
we are a star trek family we truly enjoy all things star trek but when stories started to sway from the original theme probably really started with the series star trek enterprise stories of an alternate beginning with a time war and an attack on earth that never happened prior in any star trek movie or series then when the new star trek movie came out and romulans get thrown back in time and obliterate the planet vulcan this totally changes the scope of stories to come so this movie goes on from this alternate time line or reality take your pick yes this was a story done in the original star trek series and then in star trek the wrath of khan but keeping that weve skewed from what was to what now is this story does a great job of being told and truly some terrific humor and character relationship building in the original star trek kirk and spock come to be brothers always looking out for each other and this is carried on in this new movie even stronger and when it comes to action it may seem a little slow at times but when it does happen youre not disappointed the dreadnaught class of ship was never built in the original series but in this departure from the old to the new we get to finally see a dreadnaught a british term for a super battleship prior to the outbreak of wwi built and in action which could lend to even more exciting battles to come with the klingon empire and the federation in any future stories this movie builds on the relationship that many old star trek fans kept saying existed between spock and uhura thou it is about time they put seat belts on the ships of the federation they need to put in the walls far too many people keep getting sucked out into space even in this movie crew safety was paramount in the concept of the series but again this movie delivers a good story and action we purchased this from our local best buy store and have watched it half a dozen times so far thou my daughter and i did not like how paramount started this new venture it has gotten our family captivated in the extra features thou this time the outtakes bloopers were not included total bummer because it is enjoyable to watch the cast members having fun even when they make mistakes we wish they would include outtakes with every movie these actors actresses truly create an enjoyable movie experience they do a fantastic job of bringing back star trek for the new generation and those of us who were used to the older star trek with shatner company once we look past the what was can enjoy this alternate universe of the federation and a new spin on stories yet to unfold cant wait for the next star trek movie come on paramount get it in gear 
since the dawn of television greatness when it had but a handful of channels color tv was blossoming and you would wind down the late hours with the star spangled banner before signing off with no other recourse but go to bed or read a book man was journeying a new frontier that series plus a host of many others with good or bad remakes have held our attention one way or another some have come gone some still remain and star trek is one who has a legion of fans still enthralled wanting more the series went through many changes even winding up on those retro saturday mornings when it wasnt retro either live or animated then it had the original crew form a movie series which actually continued the legacy into high gear thus furthered by the next generation but the series doesnt feel truely at home without the chemistry between the original crew headed by james t kirk and that my friend is where the action is and this reboot makes no bones about it this is what star trek is all about 
say what you like regarding the star trek arbrams verse when it all comes down to it this is a great movie we have tons of action ultra high quality production values a story that holds up great acting character moments and an ending that keeps us wanting more some may argue that iron man is the better movie but i have to say into darkness delivered the kind of action i expect in a summer popcorn movie i cant wait to see what he does with star wars 
i have always liked star trek ever since first having seen the original series on tv way back when i was a kid so when j j abrams made the first star trek reboot movie in i had some mixed feelings about it all i thought that the movie could have been a lot better than it was and that it should have also been something completely new and refreshing instead of playing around with already known and well established characters as it did but at the same time i had to admit that it was a much better movie than its predecessor nemesis was after a few more viewings though the star trek really began to grow on me having said all of that i really enjoyed star trek into darkness and actually think that it is one of the best star trek movies ever made i now look forward to seeing a third one in the series and i hope that all of the current original cast members return for at least one more adventure and i also hope that it wont be as long of a wait as it was between the star trek and into darkness was 
pros very little explicit details are shown concerning sexual or violent events im extremely glad for this as the movie will provide entertainment and enthusiasm for the young children unlike most movies created nowadays holds true to the other star trek movies time line and facts almost apparently realistic effects until the last part of the movie obviously the re entry scene is slightly exaggerated audio was pretty good and find i didnt have to continuously turn down the sound during loud bass events maybe its just me i didnt analyze this much or maybe it was due to the amazon hd streaming the movie had an unpredictable plot seemed to mock the legal scenario of telling the whole truth or finding the rest of the story presented or confronted young viewers with ethical scenarios some things i didnt like the eye liner on the male actors on second thought think the male actors had more makeup on then the female actors maybe the male actors required it 
i know some people that claim to be star trek fans will tell you this movie is a disgrace to the franchise i am here to tell you that i am a huge star trek fan and i found this movie to be very good i realize abrams has changed the universe but that is what makes this so interesting we all watched the original series the next generation voyager etc rather than relive the past over and over and over again what we have is something new we have a franchise that is decades old and still relevant today that is what makes these movies so refreshing the fact that they arent predictable and feel new for those non star trek fans you will love the movie it is very fast paced there is humor maybe a bit too much there is a bad guy there is suspence there is great writing and a great story and more importantly these actors have done a fabulous job working together and you can feel the chemistry like you did in all the star trek series even if you are not a trekie this is a great fun movie to watch william shatner once blasted the next generation when it was coming out on tv he said the trek fans would never accept the new series he was wrong just like how the trek fans are wrong about these movies 
most movies dont include great action drama now days but star trek into darkness does it this movie is heavily driven on the emotional development spocks character and the action is undeniably exciting 
to all the obsessive mega fans who claim this is an insult to the star trek universe guess what there is no star trek universe its fiction its a story with plots and characters locations and events all made up sorry to shake the very foundation of your beliefs but from the first episode of tos gene roddenberry was telling stories about truth honor trust compassion intelligence companionship bravery and above all else human emotion we care about kirk and spock we care about scotty bones all the rest they are well written complex characters the plots are mostly well written complex stories you invest your time and are entertained this movie is exciting emotional passionate and you become fully invested in it as long as you dont compare actors who might have played a particular role previously or worry the a character dies who never did in the older versions enjoy the moment its star trek for not tos tng ds or any other incarnation beethoven wrote only one symphony but hundreds of orchestras have played it recorded it and not one interpretation is the same as any other into darkness is an awesome interpretation of roddenberrys creation ive been a fan from the beginning and i left the theater with a huge smile 
four years have passed since jj abrams last star trek film and it was well worth the wait diehard trek fans as well as new fans to the franchise will enjoy this fast paced action packed adventure those familiar with the original series will of course catch more clues and references to the impending story and correlation to the alternate version and this super fan was not disappointed in the least my one complaint is that abrams could stand to tone down the lens flares during the bridge scenes full of intense fight scenes drama suspense intrigue and plenty of humor star trek into darkness is an excellent sequel and while i loved the story the strong point for the film is the characters we had the backstory and groundwork set in the previous film and here we see the characters grow and their relationships develop the cast and acting is spot on once again chris pine kirk zachary quinto spock and simon pegg scotty have great central roles in this film i wish karl urban bones had more screen time i think hes fantastic and of course benedict cumberbatch was brilliant in his complex villainous role while some of the big mystery reveals were a bit predictable especially to fans i think it served as a respectable homage i only hope we dont have to wait another four years to see another installment but with abrams focusing on star wars next star trek will need to pass on to another director for that to happen a strong foundation has been laid here with this alternate crew with limitless possibilities for new stories and adventures whether it be more films tv or novels ill certainly be going to see this one a few more times in the theater especially on imax the d screening was nice but after the first hour i forgot about it beyond the first few scenes i dont think the d is necessary either way dont miss this exciting sequel review previously posted at scifichick 
im amazed at the number of people here who seem to want nothing more than another classic trek tv episode if you dont like it because it violates some minutiae of trek lore get over it already this movie just plain rocks this is star trek for the st century but you can still watch it stoned just like we did back in the s then see it again because you cant quite remember how it was that kirk managed to save the universe 
 review is for the theatrical version in imax some spoilers into darkness is an excellent follow up to the film star trek the alternate history that j j abrams writes still has a lot of the borrowed items from the original tv and movies to make the film interesting to fans yet for those not into the canon the film stands on its own as an interesting science fiction film spoilers as you may have heard by now the botany bay was discovered earlier than in the original time line and someone who knows better wants to militarize the federation and wants to use khan for that purpose lets get a man who knows how a military mind works and use him to handle the klingon threat quite a story end spoilers relationships the film is very character driven now this may seem at odds to you if you enjoy a film full of special effects and warp speed ships even so kirk is the same brash self who will break the rules if it means saving a life the film starts out with kirk swiping a holy scroll from natives white wild natives with eyes that blink backwards weird but i digress and somehow we have his science officer about to blow a cold fusion bomb into a volcano and save the planet yeow and the enterprise having the ability to land on the surface of a planet was a new look as well some fans squawk about spock having a relationship with uhura first its not that unheard of remember in the original series with apollo and second its done in a tasteful manner and really could have been cut out altogether the primary relationship of course is the kirk spock dynamic as in the original series kirk spock and at times mccoy really go at it would have liked this to have been better scripted with more banter and some humor injected here the other relation is between khan played coolly by cumberbatch and the federation playing on others emotions playing them to get what he wants fascinating character as kirk he cares about his crew frozen and awaiting revival and besides wanting revenge on the federation he wants kirk very dead cons scotty in this film is a riot of a scotman but chekov not so much not all characters come off well would have liked to have seen some more romance with the carol marcus character ah well special effects see the film on the big imax screen the cost is prohibitive but the effects are well worth it the chase through a pink purple peter maxx like jungle the new warp speed and the speed chasing with klingon space cruisers is worth the price make up the klingons must mention the klingons they make a brief and exciting entrance half way through the film as they confront a powerless shuttle containing kirk and a few hand picked men who smartly took off their red shirts lol and as in star trek the motion picture the view of klingons have again changed music the score is excellently done the mix throughout was amazing and fit each scene well alexander courages score is inserted where appropriate stay for the end credits and listen to the coda awesome stuff bottom line a must see especially for wrath of khan fans youll see many similarities to an interesting story that will keep you on the edge throughout recommend star trek ii the wrath of khanstar trek countdown to darkness enterprise edition exclusive variant cover star trek countdown to darkness 
i read another review where someone says abrams takes a burned out franchise and renews it i couldnt agree more i am a die hard trek fan been watching since i was years old which was right about the time the series ended i have watched every movie spin off and now yet another adaptation of my beloved show only to see i was ecstatic at the portrayal of things with some gripes mostly minor that exist solely because i try not to be a purist but as a sci fi fan you just cannot help it sometimes the action the re telling of the story and cumberbatchs homage to the timeless montalban villain left you really appreciating the herculean task that abrams took on and that given what when and where he had to work it he did a great job i look forward to more films but will be hesitant since hollywoods endless need for money ruins even the mighty phoenixs ability to rise from the ashes one can debate that pine or quinto didnt deliver this or that as you can pick apart anything but as much as i did not want to like quinto as spock i found myself warming to this re imagined version of him as somehow i know its blasphemy more human in the end if you ever liked anything star trek you must see this and decide for yourself or if you dont know star trek like lived in a cave this would be a welcome place to drop in after you see the first abrams movie 
star trek into darkness is one of the best films of the star trek series of movies to my mind the only two films that surpass it are star trek ii the wrath of khan and star trek first contact the movie is very solid on story characterization and special effect laden action sequences that never overshadow the story or the characters there are two main things that have made star trek an iconic epic over the years the first is gene roddenberrys vision of a hope for a better tomorrow that mankind is not only looking to explore strange new worlds but to explore the unknown possibilities of existence perhaps q in the final episode of star trek the next generation summed up roddenberrys vision better than anyone when he states the exploration that awaits you is not mapping stars and studying nebulae but charting the unknown possibilities of existence the other main component is the relationship between three men that served to demonstrate an unconditional brotherly comrade love between kirk spock and mccoy in many ways these three characters cover the spectrum of characteristics spock the ever logical vulcan constantly in pursuit of knowledge and logic and always seeming to criticize humans for their irrationality and ever present emotions and yet we have seen spock behave almost emotionally when he has saved the lives of his friends countless times mccoy the irascible country doctor who covers the opposite end of the spectrum from spock as the one who yields more to emotional reactions but under mccoys bickering and arguing is a powerful love that he as for both of his friends in the middle of that spectrum we have kirk who is as prone to using logic and common sense as he is to using his gut feeling and intuition and kirk has an almost obsessive love for his shipmates his ship and his friends the film takes place very early on in kirks career in fact he has yet to perform his legendary five year mission so one has to realize that kirk is still a fledgling captain regardless of how tactically brilliant he may be the same can be said of spock who is still trying to control the emotions that always seem to be percolating just under the surface his relationship with uhura is still alive and somewhat well the couples relationship will be tested a bit during this film and mccoy is still the ever complaining questioning doctor who seems to have a millions sayings ready to be unleashed at any given moment because the characters are young and new their relationship has not yet had enough time to gell into the iconic relationship that we know of these three men that being said there is an emotional moment that takes place in the film that unfortunately isnt as powerful as it could have been because of the absence of the strength of that relationship i had almost hoped that such a moment might be savored for another movie later on when the viewer has a chance to become more emotionally invested with its characters and be able to feel more strongly what the characters are feeling on a more optimistic note as a result a powerful bond and friendship will be solidified the story takes place when starfleet utilizes a man who is renowned for his intelligence and tactical abilities however the big prize of starfleet inevitably turns upon his former masters and kirk and company are dispatched to deal with him obviously things are not what they seem and kirk is pitted against all odds anyone who is familiar with the story of star trek ii will remember the famed kobayashi maru test which was also utilized in the last film in many ways this outing serves as kirks kobayashi maru a veritable baptism by fire you might also notice some other parallel elements from that film as well which i wont disclose here for those who havent seen this film yet the cast of the film are as good as they were in the previous film chris pine is a fantastic captain kirk hes arrogant and cocky and pine has a real gift for comedic facial expressions and timing and we get to see kirk begin to feel his affinity for his crew and his ship zachary quinto is playing spock as well as he can i dont know if people understand how difficult a role this is leonard nimoy directed robin curtis lt saavik in star trek iii the search for spock he stated to play a vulcan you must have the look of a thousand years of wisdom in your eyes it is not nearly as easy as it sounds but again spock is very young here in this entry in short however leonard nimoy really did make spock nearly impossible for anyone else to play with as much complexity and depth that he did benedict cumberbatch is the surprise new character here he plays john harrison with savagery and intelligence that really added some wonderful dimensions to the character harrison is a man who is like a grandmaster chess player someone who is always a number of moves ahead of everyone else and it is fun to see if kirk can find a way to outwit him i only wished that he had been given more screen time i really wanted to see a bit more exploration of this character i still think that of all of the characters to really nail the interpretations of their previous counterparts karl urbans dr mccoy is still the best his speech pattern and mannerisms are all nearly dead on he isnt in this film nearly as much as i would have liked but every scene he is in is a welcome one j j abrams has succeeded in breathing life back into a franchise that was all but dead this film is fun exciting and even thought provoking when we consider the kind of people that we help to create if you enjoyed the last film it is nearly a certainty that you will enjoy this one as much if not more so and the fun part is there is still plenty of star trek left to be told 
my dads the big fan ive seen many of the movies but its much more his thing than mine with that said i enjoyed this movie alot when they started the series over again with the first star trek movie i seen and enjoyed it this one essentially picks up where that one left off im not goint to throw any spoilers out there but do want to say those that are complaining about lousy acting or a bad plot i disagree the visuals were a fantastic and the story was pretty believable this new set of movies isnt following the old one to a t and i think thats great new stories or variations for a new generation my dad went on and on about all the old cues from the old movies that were injected into this one although i dont know them he sure did pick up on them for the die hard fans of the movies i think you either going to love it or hate it depending on perspective and what you expecting to take out of it for others like me that are just enjoying a great sci fi movie this new star treck series of movies is very good 
this is to complete out collection of the star trek series i havent had a chance to watch it yet but i hope i will enjoy it 
after about minutes we walked out of the d version fortunately the multiplex we were at had screens in d the manager there told us they now sell more tickets for d than d we had to wait about minutes for the d to start but it was well worth the wait into darkness is a terrific star trek movie i enjoyed all the characters very much to me star trek has always been more about the story and the plot rather than special effects this movie delivers both very well hopefully when the blu ray comes out they will include a true digital copy as opposed to the universally loathed ultraviolet 
i must say ive liked star trek most of life though when they started to make the movies one thing changed peoples do age as when they got to the th movie i was glad they threw the towel in but money kept shatner going an then sttng movies came along only first contact was any good but with these actors saleries the budget in theses films were small then came the re boot i was a nayser i didnt think it would work till i saw the last film into darkness is awesome i saw it in imax d an must say i was blown away wow now i want to get a d dvd player lol this film effects casting cgi are well done though i could never think a starship can go underwater on a planet made me sratch my head but its a movie in movies they are plotholes lol you still gotta love it and yes cant wait for the bluray 
from my wife sarah ive been a fan of star trek since the first series this movie was excellent heres why the story was engaging exciting and had plenty of edge of your seat moments the way it wove the new story together using prior movie and tv themes to build on was kind of genius those who know star trek will enjoy that it had humor with a few good laughs and chuckles but it also brought tears to my eyes i loved the way they developed the relationships between the main characters especially between spock and kirk i very much disagree with the poster who said there wasnt enough character development i felt it was quite the opposite there were surprises especially one big one which i wont reveal i enjoyed that this movie wasnt predictable the casting was spot on its so believable that these are the young versions of spock kirk etc the acting was superb what else can you want i saw it at an imax d theater and id highly recommend that the d was phenomenal on this huge screen there were moments when i could imagine i was in space i think that star trek fans as well as those who are new to star trek will enjoy the movie you really dont have to know star trek history to enjoy this movie but if you are familiar youll get a lot more out of it so star trek fans shouldnt miss this new addition i also recommend this movie to all scifi and action fans ill be purchasing this movie when it becomes available and im sure ill watch it many times 
yes i know this borrowed so heavily from the original wrath of khan that it can be considered a prequel and much talk has already been provided regarding that issue as well as various summaries and opinions i will forego that and write regarding only the quality of the disc on blu ray i have not watched the d version yet so this review focuses only upon the d version watched on a new panasonic zt series monitor video you couldnt have had a film such as this without the extensive use of cgi and other special effects that said the various effects do not cheapen the image with poor production like you might see in those sharkanodo vs dinocroc sci fi films you watch on the sci fi channel all special effects are done very well in my opinion and add to the story line a huge problem with special effects laden films is that often the film becomes about the fx and not the characters or story line not so with star trek into darkness the encode to blu ray provides a very clean image with excellent contrast and color resolution the majority of the color grading is fairly cool to the viewer but tends to warm up with close ups at no point did i see any distracting or noticeable artifacts or dirt in the imaging and details even in the shadow areas are easily discernible mbps rate appeared to average in the low thirties and while some dismiss the mbps rate as being unimportant i find that the higher it is the better the imaging while you may or may not like the film as i did the video transfer to blu ray is quite excellent audio was very pleased that both a and mix was offered and a lossless audio codec was used i watched the film using the audio for my home theater setup there is so much going on in this films audio mix that the dialogue and foley fx battle for your attention this doesnt mean that you have to adjust your remotes volume control once set as both dialogue and foley audio are properly balanced its just that during the many action scenes the surround audio fully envelopes you and creates one of those you are there moments there is a great amount of discreet directionality to all of the surrounds and panning from front to rear and rear to front is frequent never the less the dialogue center channel has most of the heavy lifting as it does in every movie and it does so just fine the lfe sub channel will earn its stripes as it will be in constant use i would suggest that viewers be careful regarding their sub channel as i often find friends who have it set far too high the sub should not be noticeable as a discreet channel as low end bass is non directional the mix of audio was simply excellent in and i can safely come to the conclusion is that if you have a system as most do then you will find the directionality of the audio to be one of the best in your collection the lossless audio really deserves stars extras there are a number of extras on the blu ray regarding many aspects of what it took to make this film however i did not have the time as yet to watch them so i will not comment upon the quality of these usually short docs however there are also several previews of other films that come up when you put the blu ray in this annoys the heck out of me as it forces you to pay for nothing more than advertising which takes up valuable disc space causing for even more compression to be placed upon the film you are buying who wants to pay for an ad i just want to pay for a film in this case star trek all my reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the blu ray disc and i do hope that this review has been of some help to you regarding your purchase if so hopefully my other reviews will as well thanks for reading
im old enough to remember the original star trek series and i have a deep affection for it despite its obvious flaws i was ready to despise this latest reboot when star trek was released in but some terrific choices were made and i left the theater grinning i was delighted with the casting choices four years ago and how this new version of star trek gave enough nods to the original without going over the top so i have been anticipating the release of star trek into darkness ever since the credits rolled on the last entry i was not disappointed what do you want from a star trek movie the world has changed over the past years and action is an essential element of any science fiction movie special effects rule and the budget can be enormous for proven franchises that simply cant fail at the box office there is certainly no lack of action in this movie and it doesnt waste any time in surfacing kirk and some of the crew are shown fleeing the inhabitants of a primitive planet after trying to prevent a volcano from destroying it the fast cuts look like something out of a bourne movie and provide the first adrenaline rush there are no shortage of similar moments over the remaining two hours while i loved star trek it was pretty light on story it served as a vehicle to introduce the new crew and did so splendidly but the actual story wasnt particularly memorable thats not to say that it wasnt tremendously enjoyable what into darkness does is develop on that strong foundation we learn more about the characters and what binds them together but this time were also given a story with more depth the story is built around the hunt for john harrison who is a man that seems out to destroy the federation who is he what are his motivations needless to say kirk is given the task of tracking him with the enterprise and her crew expect chase scenes fights battles and all the special effects you could possibly desire its what you wont expect that will make you smile most of all the theme of family is used in various forms as well as revenge and the lust for power the great thing about this reboot is that thanks to a plot device in the previous movie anything can happen to the characters we know and love part of the fun is recognizing events and people that you know from other versions of the franchise and seeing where their story deviates from the one you expect into darkness introduces a couple of characters that youll know if you remember your star trek history i wouldnt dream of ruining that surprise for you so ill leave it at that youll also an encounter an alien race that you might be familiar with ive mentioned that the movie is action packed its budget also means that the effects are superb but dont make the mistake of thinking that into darkness is all action and no substance there are several exchanges of dialogue which create genuine emotion this cast can act one example takes place in a bar between pike and kirk and its an excellent example of key characters forming a bond my only disappointment with the movie is that simon pegg didnt seem like the best choice to play scotty but he won me over this time my only criticism of the movie is that some of the key characters dont get enough screen time but i am sure they will all have their moments to shine in future entries in the series as with the original series the relationships between kirk spock and mccoy are vital and i think all three actors do a great job portraying them however its also wonderful to see characters like uhura with more significant roles theres really no way to explain the plot without giving away too much if you enjoyed the first reboot and like these actors theres a strong chance that you will love star trek into darkness it seemed to last about an hour but had enough content for four hours thats meant as a compliment you wont see anyone washing dishes for minutes in this movie where will the franchise go next i hope that it is a long and glorious journey i would happily watch another five movies with this crew and can only hope that there wont be a four year gap between them go and see this movie if you care about star trek in any way because youll have a lot of fun oh and be prepared to see more lens flares they are apparently here to stay overall score this is the first movie i have seen in theaters since roger eberts passing normally i would head over to his site to see whether his opinion was close to mine it seems very strange not having that option 
i loved the movie i loved the condition of the dvd came just as advertised good quality dvd glad of purchase
one of my favorite adversaries is khan this was such a good retelling of his story so smart but devoid of compassion for those that are lesser than he and his 
whats the deal with meaningless titles they annoy me the title has no more to do with the movie than it could have to many movies like the empire strikes back could have been called into darkness and it would have held more meaning to the actual movie than this one i get that it sounds cool but seriously the title of anything ought to relate to the thing thats being titled in more than some vague way past that though the movie was pretty awesome abrams knows how to bring the action and keep you tense and on the edge of your seat and hey there was no red matter this time so double plus good without giving anything away i loved best the role reversal of spock and kirk that was pretty awesome i have only two negatives other than the title at this point i do not want to see old spock pop up in every movie as their tiny god in a box i get that the fans love seeing nimoy i do i get it but from a story perspective its gonna get old if they always contact him when theyre in trouble as much as i love simon pegg and love simon pegg as scotty he is the one character that doesnt quite feel right he has moments where he feels like scotty but most of the time the character seems off target i dont blame this on pegg as he has no control over the writers having him do things that are not scottyish speaking of the characters i still love karl urban the most man he could be deforest kelley i swear i cant tell the difference hes just like watching the original bones at work and they gave him the line well not the line but a the line im a doctor not a it was awesome zachary quinto comes in a close second to urban on pulling off the channeling of the original character of course he has had the privilege of actually working with nimoy so he wouldnt have an excuse to not be able to pull it off and well then theres benedict cumberbatch who was a perfect match to the rest of the cast mostly its the voice but he seems to be able to play any kind of role he wants to play see war horse and tinker tailor soldier spy to understand what i mean by that and thats really about all i can say about the movie without giving stuff away and i dont want to do that as someone who is not really a star trek fan i loved the movie i do know that there are trek fans out there that dont like what abrams is doing but really im not quite sure i get that because hes really captured the heart of the original series with how closely theyve managed to get the characters to their originals its actually enough that it makes me want to go back and watch those old episodes and how much more successful can you be than that tribble 
after the release of the number one hit star trek j j abrams and the crew are back for seconds in star trek into darkness this movie is one of the top three greatest movies of the storyline is emotional and well written the characters are well done and well acted the villain will leave you with goose bumps and at the edge of your seat for more j j abrams does not disappoint to fly past the greatness of the first movie a must see and a must buy you have to see this movie 
i loved this movie and so did my entire family it is a great star trek film with a wonderful story line and great special effects too 
j j abrams continues his star trek reboot with this power packed blockbuster this is a must see for any fan of star trek the formats make it super easy to access the feature film from almost any device there are simple instructions to follow to activate your digital copy as if the feature film werent enough there are wonderful behind the scenes special features about the making of the film i cant get enough of it 
for the most part i enjoyed this movie the plot is solid the acting superb and the special effects and sound are top notch however this film franchise is walking a precarious line in terms of being overindulgent in action and violence which doesnt adhere to roddenberrys vision the writers and director of this revamped franchise claim that theyre trying to strike a healthy balance between roddenberrys star trek and what we have now which is star wars where star trek hasnt gone before dont get me wrong i still enjoyed this film but must say that its a bit hard to get used to being a fan of such films as wrath of khan and the undiscovered country with their intellectual approach and lighter on action speaking of khan he was portrayed magnificently in this latest film and was every bit as evil as the portrayal of the character he simply has the right voice to make his character one of the darkest and most menacing in the star trek universe i recommend this film for die hard fans and those who want to venture into this series with an open mind 
after striking gold with hisstar trek movie that managed to be both a reboot and a sequel to the star trek franchise j j abrams hits another home run with star trek into darkness in this newest trek movie abrams manages to give non trek fans a rousing action story outstanding special effects another excellent score by composer michael giacchino and for trek fans all of this plus some good natured nods to previous movies although some were offended by this more on this point later also in the spirit of the original star trek television series andstar trek iv the voyage homeandstar trek insurrection abrams gives us a message movie with commentary on current events minor spoiler in this movie kirk is ordered by his superior officer to destroy a terrorist in enemy territory via the use of long range torpedoes after turning in excellent performances in the movie the cast is once again outstanding in this film chris pine continues to channel william shatner and yet put his own stamp on the role of captain james t kirk a remarkable achievement by a remarkable actor likewise zachary quinto expertly balances leonard nimoys portrayal of spock with his own mix of melancholy and occasional bursts of emotion and even anger after the destruction of his planet in the previous film i completely buy into the idea that his spock would show more emotion than nimoys the rest of the cast also turns in good performances karl urban is very good but slightly underused as bones mccoy john cho as sulu gets a nice scene of his own anton yelchin as chekov makes the most of his screen time and zoe saldana is used well again as uhura alice eve is also good as dr carol marcus but is not given much to do most likely she was introduced in this film with the intent of featuring her more prominently in the next movie simon pegg as scotty is both heroic and hilarious in this film and steals several scenes major spoilers ahead re villains peter weller appears as the corrupt starfleet admiral alexander marcus and makes an effective villain special mention must be made of benedict cumberbatch who major spoiler plays khan cumberbatchs khan is just as villainous as the classic khan and even more brutal but yet manages to explain his actions to the extent that while you may not agree with what he does it still makes a certain degree of sense from his point of view cumberbatch is so good in the role that i think he turns in a heath ledger joker esque performance as khan and i really hope we see him again in a future sequel while some fans object to his nationality in comparison to the classic khans nationality i feel that as with any film some imagination must be used when you go to see a movie major spoiler as i mentioned earlier some fans have been offended by the movies references to previous events in star trek in particular some fans have been offended by the nod to the famous ending tostar trek ii the wrath of khan hd when in this film kirk sacrifices himself albeit temporarily to save the enterprise and then shares an emotional goodbye with spock through a transparent door i know some disagree but i thought this was an interesting way to turn spocks sacrifice in star trek ii on its head while at the same time reverse the ultimate meaning of the farewell between the two friends as screenwriter bob orci has explained in star trek ii kirk and spock are sharing a final goodbye as the culmination of decades of friendship whereas in this movie this emotional moment is really the true beginning of their friendship i disagree completely with the notion that this moment is a copy and paste rip off of star trek ii does this movie edge out star trek ii as the best star trek movie imho in my mind close but for one nitpick the movies use of the enterprise the enterprise has always been as much of a character in star trek as kirk spock picard data etc it has always been much more than an airplane helicopter etc or something simply used to ferry our characters from point a to point b in the story spoiler while the enterprise manages to hang tough in the face of heavy fire from admiral marcus secret battleship u s s vengeance it never returns fire to defeat its adversary which i think is a storytelling flaw in star trek ii andstar trek vi the undiscovered country the enterprise takes heavy damage but also eventually overcomes its enemy starship adversaries in those films in this film the vengeance is eventually disabled in a clever ploy undertaken by spock but i think it would have been more satisfying from a storytelling point of view if its comeuppance had been delivered by the enterprise herself on that subject after the scimitar instar trek nemesis the narada in star trek and the vengeance in star trek into darkness i think the writers have mined the massive powerful battleship versus the smaller less powerful enterprise plotline enough i hope the next film gives us a more evenly matched naval engagement between the enterprise and the enemy vessel where the enterprise prevails in summary star trek into darkness is an excellent film for star trek fans and non trek fans of action adventure films alike and should not be missed live long and prosper 
as a casual viewer i dont dare nitpick or overanalyze anything related to the star trek universe i enjoy it for what it is and i am completely hooked i was in love with the reboot when it came out in and this sequel was so worth the wait as far as i know it still takes place in the alternate time line so liberties were taken and new events can take place because of it this is a fast paced action film but it is also a film about friendship and forging bonds it really is all about spock and kirk and they couldnt have done it better than this zachary quinto is simply extraordinary in this he stays perfectly in character no matter the situation his professional relationship with kirk is just amusing to witness simply for the fact that they are polar opposites they bicker disagree on almost everything and yet you can see the evolvement of both their characters throughout the movie when they are on screen together you know you are in for a treat even when the unexpected happens and the most subtle scene becomes the most poignant the rest of the cast is top notch as well with a few characters getting less screen time than the first but understandable for this particular film however it is benedict cumberbatch that absolutely steals the film you cant take your eyes off of him his voice so dark and full of promise so elegant with a touch of crazy he is perfect and i hope to see much more from him in future films lets talk about the score its fantastic very rarely do i lose concentration during a fight scene to admire the music but here it happens quite often just a great effective musical score the special effects cgi are all done to perfection as somone who is picky about that i can say i dont have any complaints regarding the production value of into darkness i cant wait for the blue ray if it looked that great on the big screen i look forward to seeing how it looks with perfect clarity in my living room star trek into darkness is a great film for those not really into star trek i didnt think i would care much for the reboot as im not a huge sci fi fan but i was hooked from the first scenes and now i am completely open to watching the original films as well if im right i think there are alot of other people thinking the same thing 
i wasnt sure that j j abrams and his crew would be able to pull off another success with this franchise the star trek reboot was a surprise hit with audiences and critics that no one really saw coming when i first saw the trailer for that film i thought i was looking at a last desperate attempt to make star trek relevant much to my surprise i ended up applauding at the end of the reboot it was fast paced well acted and visually extraordinary the most entertaining space opera to hit the big screens since the original star wars trilogy more importantly it managed to breathe new life into the star trek franchise trek was cool and except for some trek purists out there everyone applauded the film now years have passed there is now a high expectation on a trek film that was not placed on the entry i had my doubts star trek was a surprise a great blockbuster that few saw coming into darkness rides in four years later and had to meet expectations set by the film and it did star trek into darkness is what a quality summer blockbuster and sequel should be it doesnt slow itself down at any points and gets straight to what the audience cares about character development and interactions are handled in such a way that the film never gets boring and the narrative moves forward without many stalls at times i found myself on the edge of the seat and throughout the entire film i legitimately felt for the characters and wanted to know how the conflict would be resolved this movie knows how to take a basic plot and transform it into grade a entertainment we cannot address into darkness without discussing its villain many complained about the blue collar villain nero in the trek i personally enjoyed him but the masses have spoken and we do get a vastly superior antagonist in the form of benedict cumberbatch sherlock cumberbatch is a menacing physically imposing charismatic figure who easily dominates every scene he appears on screen for in other words everything nero was not although i think some trek purists may complain about this character for spoiler related matters i think most viewers will just accept him for the outstanding performance the only fault i can think of is that the film isnt any larger in scale than the previous in fact given the last ones villain was destroying entire planets into darkness may be somewhat of a step back in scale but this movie didnt need to be like the dark knight where each film raises the stakes as a continuation of a long running franchise into darkness is exciting has genuine humor suspense visual spectacle superb action and character moments it is what every popcorn film should strive to be of course some fans will complain over the emphasis on action over political intrigue and such i get it i love that stuff in the show but we just have to accept that were dealing with two different mediums if youre going to make a blockbuster movie you have to appeal to the masses and abrams star trek movies do it incredibly well if you are one of those star trek purists who cannot accept the changes made in the reboot youre better off steering away from this entry as it will probably give you more to gripe about but if youre a casual trek fan like me who loved the film you will not be disappointed 
i had read some negative reviews on this movie i just saw it today in d it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time it is terrific just love the characters in it they have been cast so well they all match like it was the lst day star trek was here dont believe any negatives on it go see it ginny
compelling intense emotional brilliant let me just say that i am not the type of person to describe a movie as brilliant but thats all i could think walking out of this movie the good the plot was smart and entertaining not quite something weve never seen before but its still really well crafted j j abrams proves once again he is a great story teller when it comes to directing summary james t kirk chris pine is struggling with his responsibilities as captain but when starfleet is attacked by one of their own benedict cumberbatch kirk must prove if he truly has what it takes to command the enterprise and if his crew can find the terrorist and bring him to justice i know a lot of hard core trekkies are thinking oh great star trek has become a simple popcorn flick dont worry plenty of twists and turns along with a few easter eggs and nods to the original series acting is absolutely perfect chris pine zachary quinto zoe saldana and the rest of the enterprise cast all give great performances as the iconic crew newcomer benedict cumberbatch steals every scene he is in giving an impressive and intimidating performance as the films villain john harrison there are no bad performances in the movie effects are incredible the action is exhilarating while enhanced by the d the cgi is great but the impressive set designs and practical effects should not be overlooked very fast pacing not a dull moment here despite the films length it goes by pretty fast very entertaining beginning to end the bad pacing is great but probably too fast there should be at least a few more minutes in the middle to give audiences time to breathe probably one are two more action sequences than there needs to be although they are all fantastic and well done too much lens flare it works for a lot of the movie but is seriously over used it can be pretty distracting from whats going on at times overall there are very few problems with the movie for me there are certain twists that take the movie back to source material from the original series which work really well there are also certain events from other star trek movies that in a way repeat themselves in this story i wouldnt call this a remake cause this is a new series that takes place in an alternate timeline due to the time travel that occurred in the first movie from point is some of theses events that repeat themselves some fans will love others will hate again there are certain parts of the film for the hard core trekkies that will be hit or miss as a casual fan of the star trek franchise i loved this movie not all of the throwbacks to classic star trek work but i at least appreciated them this isnt just an entertaining action movie its a good movie in general it doesnt quite go where no star trek movie has gone before but its still one heck of a ride 
what a ride taken by itself this meets the highest standards of sf action movies the cast was great even if kahn sort of stole the stage from the enterprisers effects and cgi cant be beaten especially the various starships in distress the plot moved well and kept the pace up right to the end as a part of the star trek canon it works pretty well the various actors representing the younger versions of mccoy uhura scotty and the rest had close enough physical resemblances to the originals to keep the continuity believable im not a die hard fan so i have no complaint about how this script fits with the rest of the star trek universe that said the highest standards of sf action movies tend toward weak spots in a few areas would it have been that easy to forge official star fleet papers not once but twice would scottys approach to that other ship have gone un noticed would well lots of things is it just me or do recent movies demand more in the way of suspending disbelief no matter it was an evening very well spent wiredweird
as a big fan of pretty much anything and everything trek i loved j j abrams reboot of the franchise to a point while i really liked the development of the iconic original series characters the ending of the film spinning it off into the parallel universe left a very bad taste in my mouth i really wanted to see chris pines kirk turn into bill shatners kirk for example not an entirely new imagining of the characters thus during the four year interim i put the onus on j j to completely win me over to his way of viewing the trek story with into darkness he did just that for a basic plot summary this film once again sees captain james kirk pine first officer spock zachary quinto leonard bones mccoy karl urban and the rest of the crew manning the starship u s s enterprise when terrorist james harrison benedict cumberbatch detonates an explosive device in england the enterprise takes the lead in figuring out just exactly what is going on and proposing the best plan to set things straight again this is a tough film to review because of potential major spoilers so the above was about as generic of a plot description as one can give truth be told it is a very complex film that harkens back to many themes running through multiple original series adventures from my point of view though the biggest reason that this may be the best film i see all summer is because it sets j j s trek canon right in accordance with my trek fan dom any doubts i had about his ability to tell an interesting trek story are now completely gone if you like me were left feeling a little bitter after the ending of the original trust me when i say that you will get it after watching into darkness of course all the little things also add up to create a completely engaging experience the visuals are worthy of trek science fiction the dialogue is snappy and contains doses of humor at vital points the acting is spot on and the soundtrack from michael giacchino is as much of a treat as anything thus into darkness may very well be the best film i see for some time to come without giving away any key details of the plot what i can say is that the film has the ability this time to totally please both the casual fan and the hardcore trekkie my only fear that j j will get caught up in star wars and not continue with the wonderful trek franchise he has now nurtured back to life 
loved it one of the better star treks made had a story not just computer graphics and action wont be disappointed if you are a action fan or scifi 
after watching this extended version of the already excellent first installment of the part screed edition of the hobbit i cant remember what the original was like the extended scenes are just as excellent ok maybe the goblin king song was a little over the top and unnecessary and not great and full of back story material from other books that really round out the story just a remarkable and largely faithful retelling of a wonderful story 
i put off seeing the hobbit movie in part because i read all of the critics reviews of it you may know what they said too slow paced too stodgily faithful to the book overwhelmed by extraneous material thrown in just plain silly and just not up to the prequel sequel now that ive taken in a matin eacute e of the movie i have to ask this question what movie did the critics watch the hobbit an unexpected journey th auj was the most fun that ive had at the theater in a long time yes folks i did use the f word just now let me use it again fun fun fun i wont say that the first hobbit movie was better than the lord of the rings lotr trilogy but i will say that it was more fun as a book the hobbit presented a challenge for being filmed its both a childrens book and the prequel to the lord of the rings the acme of high fantasy given such a source a movie based on the hobbit had to combine whimsy with high adventure without letting either overwhelm the other im here to say that peter jackson rose gloriously to the challenge i fell in love with th auj from its introduction intercutting bucolic scenes from the shire on the eve of bilbo bagginss one hundred and eleventh birthday with majestic marvelous and tragic scenes of the mannish trade center of dale and the dwarf kingdom of erebor the lonely mountain these scenes showed all of the loving attention to detail of the lotr movies and beautifully set the scene for a sixty years younger bilbos adventures in the inimitable perfectly faithful to the book which im completely rewriting peter jackson style he pitchforks us moviegoers next into bilbos meeting with the wandering wizard gandalf and with thirteen dwarves led by the obsessive thorin oakenshield heir to the lost kingdom of erebor jackson captures beautifully the mirth and mayhem of bilbos unexpected dinner party as well as the dark drama behind thorins quest on which the reluctant bilbo is supposed to go as a burglar soon bilbo is running out his front door without a handkerchief and he and we are off on an adventure that wont let up some critics complain that each scene th auj is longer than scenes were in the lotr trilogy but what the critics call a fault i call a virtue we have a chance to see a whole storyline play out rather than watching telescoped bits and pieces of scenes that we got in the trilogy the pace and the flow of th auj made it seem to me far shorter than its two hours and forty some odd minutes of running time for me the movie never slowed down parts of th auj are over the top but more often than not gloriously so i found sylvester mccoys portrayal of radagast the brown a portrayal in which he largely reprises his take on dr who far less intrusive than critics have made it out to be even his rabbit drawn sleigh had a mad logic to it as for mad logic the battle in the halls of the great goblin under the misty mountains wont be believed but may well just be enjoyed between scenes of adventure there are scenes of elvish wonders and of middle earths beauty that will bring tears of joy to tolkienphiles eyes at its best th auj is a visual extravaganza that makes the prequel sequel look drab th auj goes only through chapter seven of the hobbit purists may sniff at the enhanced role given to bilbo in the movie compared with what he played in that part of the book in which he was mainly baggage my response is hey the enhanced role works along with it you get to see gollum as scene stealing as ever and even glimpses of the dragon smaug who must carry the next movie and looks as if hell do so with style ill be the first to admit that th auj isnt as respectable as the lotr trilogy on the other hand as bilbo baggins learns its not until you give up being respectable that you have adventures 
mind you ive never read the lord of the rings series nor the hobbit all i can say is that ive had the opportunity to watch the lord of the rings series quite a few times and have thoroughly enjoyed each viewing having leaned something new each time i will say the hobbit fells a lot less serious and a lot more fun the dwarves tearing up the hobbit house was a lot of fun makes you want to be there celebrating in the festivities my wife and i saw it in the funky d which we very much enjoyed despite it taking a little getting used to being a blu ray enthusiast i am eagerly awaiting the blu ray d version if you like the lord of the rings you will love the hobbit march th cant get here soon enough 
this review refers to the hobbit an unexpected journey blu ray d d dvd combo pack and no other edition readers please take note of this update october the extended version of the hobbit has a running time of min whereas the theatrical cut is min so the extended version has only extra minutes of added footage as i mentioned previously in my review the additions are not expected to be as huge as those of lotr it was a pleasure to return to peter jacksons middle earth after nearly a decade the last time it was lotr hobbit is hugely entertaining exceptionally well done movie that has been created by carefully handling the original subject here is what you get in this product what is this movie about and a little food for thought if anyone wants to wait for extended version of the movie which is supposed to be released sometimes at the end of this year the product hobbit blu ray dazzles by all means the picture ans sound quality is reference grade and the details are exceptional this set has both d and d versions of the movie a special feature blu ray high def dvd and the ultraviolet digital copy hence this gives you an options of watching the movie in all possible formats the d quality is superb with exceptional depth and clarity having owned many d blu rays i would rank this among top blu rays out there the movie hobbit is a prequel to the lord of the rings trilogy and is based upon the childrens book by jrr tolkien of the same name hobbit an unexpected journey is the first installment of the trilogy and the next two movies are as follows movie hobbit the desolation of the smaug scheduled for dec movie hobbit there and back again scheduled for dec the book is classic there is no doubt about it however peter jackson did an exceptional work in bringing tolkiens creation to the celluloid his passion about the subject is known to the world and equally admired hobbit an unexpected journey is no exception though there will be debates whether the movie was completely true to the book or not i personally feel that making a trilogy over one childrens book is no joke and only peter jacksons vision would have made this possible the movie appeared slow to many which i can understand because hobbit in general has little less material than the lotr however i felt it was about the right length as i like to stay in jacksons middle earth for little longer most importantly the movie doesnt get bore at any time and has the exceptional art of storytelling imo you do not rush when you tell a story the most important part is to keep the audience engaged and this movie does it brilliantly hence if you loved lotr hobbit is a must buy as this gives you the opportunity to visit the middle earth one more time extended edition should you wait and if yes then how long and that too for mere extra minutes there are announcements being made about the extended version of this movie being launched in dec with the lotr history i wouldnt be surprised about it however before you completely ignore this d edition there are few things i would like to point out a even if extended version gets out i doubt it will be in d looks like d would be the only option b only a true fan of the movie would wait for the extended version right in that case think there are two more movies yet to come so your wait is not going to be over by dec there will be two more theatrical hobbits and lets assume even they will have extended counterparts i understand i am going too far but i said only because even i have those movies in my wish list already hence even i am thinking of making a wise buy than double dip so think a little ahead before you make any decision c as of today what i hear is even if the extended edition is out it will have min of extra footage not huge addition like lotr i dont doubt that those additions will be great but they dont seem to be as huge as they were for lotr d even with theatrical vs exdended movies i dont think they will be sold together most likely it will follow the lotr saga remember you still dont have theatrical and extended lotr on one blu ray blu ray set due to space limits summary if you like to see hobbit in d go for this edition i really doubt the extended version if its out and whenever its out will get a d blu ray release you will have plenty of d regular blu ray editions to come in future by making all permutations and combinations but i have not seen d versions of the trilogies being sold seperately with the exceptional lengths of these movies i doubt there will be an all in one pack make a wise choice considering your personal preferences 
i found out that this directors cut will only contain extra minutes are u kidding me minutes more i know there is much more than that in the lord of the rings trilogy there was much more than that that was put back in those films why is this the shortest extended version 
i was truly confused with the trilogy but this new addition seems to glue everything together i look forward to all the other additions and then will re view the trilogy 
what will we see in the extended edition more of dale including the black arrows director peter jackson mentions a previously unseen character girion who is defending the city of dale using black arrows against smaug and the black arrows play a part in an ongoing story for they are the one thing that can pierce the dragons hide more king of the wood elves thranduil peter jackson there are also issues with thranduil we get some of the reason why he and the dwarves had a falling out to do with these white gems more of hobbiton producer phillipa boyens you are going to get more of hobbiton we always wanted to wend our way through hobbiton but in the end bilbo has to run out of the door the old tooks party in which we see a younger gandalf meet bilbo baggins as a young child convincing the wizard of the young hobbits bravery and courage i wont spoil it for you but it involves a dragon and a bit of magic dwarf antics at rivendell peter jackson you are going to get some serious dwarvish disrespect of the elves at rivendell a scene between bilbo and elrond in which elrond speaks to bilbo about his quest the song of the goblin king producer fran walsh you are going to get more goblin town and the great goblin singing his song it is a great song but it was just another delay in terms of moving the story along peter jackson a number one hit from the goblin king barry humphries is going to rise up the charts well all looking good on these fronts the roads lead ever on and on 
exciting adventure but just wished it covered the whole book instead of stopping midway through luckily part will be in the theaters soon 
when i heard they were making the hobbit in parts i said oh great theyre just going to milk it to death arent they to quote thorin ive never been so wrong in all my life this isnt just a simple milking of a series for every last dime they can squeeze out of it this is an amazingly well fleshed out spectacle of pure awesome it reminded me of indiana jones and all of the best parts of the lotrs trilogy combined five stars 
since it was announced that the hobbit would be made into a trilogy of films the negative criticisms and excoriation have hardly ceased i will not address that whole aspect of the chatter about this film because i believe it is both incorrect and inappropriate peter jacksons adaptation of the lord of the rings sought to take a humongous novel and reduce it to three three hour films to the extent that jacksons accomplishment visually is stunning and an unrivaled technical marvel is by now beyond question however given that tolkeins accomplishment is primarily linguistic in nature jackson and his writers chose to chop most of that language out of the book and substitute a grand sequence of visual set pieces for all my admiration of the visual accomplishment it has always bothered me significantly that in replacing tolkeins language with an endless series of dialogue fragments that the whole point of the work was essentially lost or disfigured beyond recognition one marvels at the technical accomplishment but at the same time becomes weary and shell shocked at the unending relentless battles blood and guts gore almost exactly as howard shores wall to wall score creates unforgivable aural fatigue i say all this to point now to jacksons rendition of the hobbit here tolkeins exquisite detail has been given the time to be presented much more completely and when for example one comes to the riddle scene it is very rewarding to see it presented in full sentences and without simplistic textual redactions howard shores score is regrettably still wall to wall and very annoying at that and for the same reasons as above the hobbit an unexpected journey as a film seems to me just about right in all its aspects especially when compared to the reductio ad absurdam of jacksons lotr trilogy even its its extended versions the argument that the original novel was a slim short work and that jacksons adaptation is far too dark is absurd on its face there is plenty of humor here but the truth is that many of the episodes in the book which tolkein describes only in general terms and which would be fleshed out later in lotr are given the full forward looking treatment and deservedly so by incorporating other directly relevant materials from the rest of the lotr cycle jackson has taken tolkeins sketch and fleshed it out it is altogether a satisfying rendition of the novel whose minutes fly by rather quickly im eager to see the next installment and rather expect that it will maintain the same high standard 
the extended edition feels like the right way to watch this movie its so much better than the theatrical version i am now determined to buy all of this series in blue ray extended dont miss out get it 
five star movie zero stars for double dipping again with extended version sigh i remember discussing this years ago with the original lotr releases gotta double dip and release a theatrical version and then the extended edition anyway enough about that quick spoiler below but seriously you didnt see this already the movie brings back the magic of lotr in a big way not quite up to par but very close really i think some of the comedy was just stupid such as when gandalf killed the goblin king and the goblin king said thatll do it whoever wrote that gem should be drug out on the street and thoroughly flogged other than that silliness actually just that one part gets to me the rest is lotr goodness i saw this in fps and also regular imax and i gotta say fps was like being inside the movie after a minute adjustment period to get used to it i hope the fps extended edition bluray comes out quickly thats what im holding out for and that is what i recommend you hold out for 
let me start by saying that im a big tolkien buff and that i went into this experience very apprehensive given the liberties jackson took with the lotr movies that as a purist did not sit well with me why omit perfectly good material old forrest barrow downs etc and make up new material that is only introduced to make up an action beat and shake things up aragorns little warg detour in the second movie as well as frodos visit to pelargrir come to mind but i digress of course jackson added material here as well the difference is it wasnt specifically already introduced by tolkien differently or if it was the changes were more forgivable and served the story better i e azog as a villain its believable and it allowed jackson creative freedom w o interrupting the flow of the book i e if a scene was described in the book the movie usually followed that fairly closely the new material was introduced using the annals of the lotr and only hinted in the hobbit which in my opinion was a genius move to lift a fairly light hearted book into a somewhat darker and more interesting realm of middle earth considering tolkien wrote this before the lotr as a story to read to his children and not as a prequel to lotr per se i found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience and for me the hrs flew by ending a logical closure point at the carrock i watched it in hfr d and quite frankly i have no idea why professional critics knock this new format the picture quality was amazing the slight headache i usually experience after a long d movie was a no show and the experience was immersive it felt like you lean out of your window and watch middle earth pass by below you absolutely breathtaking and the visuals alone would be reason enough to watch it again for me it was a rare true star experience that im planning on repeating in a few weeks 
you wont be surprised to find out that things look much as they did in lord of the rings youll recognize the peaceful scenic shire and bilbos burrow mckellen comes across as ageless in the role of gandalf looking for all the world as he did as gandalf the grey in fellowship as the movie progresses the dramatic landscapes of new zealand will also be familiar as the adventurers travel far to reach the ancient dwarven home eredor now known as the lonely mountain for any who dont know the set up for the hobbit is thus decades ago a dragon chased the dwarves out of their prosperous mountain home with the dragon not having been seen in years a group of dwarves including the heir to their throne decide the time is right to check out the ancestral city gandalf decides they are correct to do so he enlists bilbo a hobbit to be their burglar for the expedition his reasons for this unusual choice are explained as you watch the film i havent read the book in a long time and i dont want to provide spoilers but if there were any details left out from the part of the story told in unexpected journey id be surprised were going to have to hours devoted to the telling of the hobbit which isnt nearly as expansive a tale as the lord of the rings books the filmmakers allowed the story to take great patience with teaching us the history and introducing various characters the cgi is just as seamless as in the lord of the rings your suspension of disbelief whether a troll orc worg or goblin is in your face will be complete the action scenes are lavish extended and frenetic in fact they were maybe a touch too frenetic making for some very large differences between the very slow pacing of establishing scenes and the frantic action of the battles the movie goes to great lengths to try to satisfy everyone from purist fans of the books to a general public who may know nothing about the hobbit other than it is a prequel to lord of the rings it may do a little too much to fill all plates a dwarven song near the beginning of the movie was enough of a lullaby to have me nodding before it was done lol the riddle game between bilbo and gollum possibly was too generously paced it is a bit like you are getting the extended version right from the start with this film there are some terrifying sequences here and those scenes may not be suitable for young children orcs are just as unattractive in this film as in lord of the rings and the close ups of goblins especially the goblin king might be enough to make some just a bit queasy these are small quibbles this is one impressive movie it will grab your attention and keep it unless the dwarves put you to sleep with their lullaby and no one pokes you to wake you back up the character building with its relaxed pace gives you a real sense of getting to know most of the dwarves along with galdalf and bilbo there is a very strong growth of character in this film for bilbo and in his relationship with his unexpected traveling companions you were going to go see this film anyway but for the record highly recommended 
i had heard mixed things about this movie and being a huge fan of the original trilogy i was curious to see how this would stack up im happy to report that it lives up to the originals in every way stunning visuals excellent story brilliant acting ill wait and buy the extended version later at almost three hours this flew right by me i loved every second of it and i was genuinely sad when it ended recommended 
i wanted to see all the extra scenes not shown in the movie and i wanted it in surround sound this fit the bill love these movies 
are you ready to return to middle earth why wouldnt you be peter jackson with the lord of the rings trilogy brought us to a place that many thought wasnt possible except in the written form a product of many of our childhoods j r r tolkien constructed an elaborate world of wizards trolls elves dwarves humans and most importantly hobbits it is an elaborately detailed world of maps homelands stories and adventures it couldnt possibly be realized anywhere close to what j r r tolkiens imagination did yet jackson pulled it off better than anyone could have hoped now hes trying again the hobbit is a step backward into the history of middle earth it is quite simply the adventure that bilbo baggins takes that leads to him writing his book there and back again peter jackson is trying to do the unthinkable with this trilogy duplicate the magic he pulled off before much can be told from this first installment and whether or not the magic is still there the movie filmed at twice frame speed as traditional film frames has many geeks talking about how it will look too real ultimately at frames it could look as crisp and real as a soap opera well first of all with a film like this it takes a lot of guts to attempt such a thing a movie with such obvious special effects and makeup yet the opposite could also be achieved a level of escapism and realism that not only delivers a quality movie experience but also sucks you into a world that you dont want to leave peter jackson has learned a few things from his first trilogy and you can see it in the hobbit this world is even more realized the characters are more fleshed out richard armitages depiction of thorin is full of heart and passion the faithfulness to the book itself is even more realized more importantly the journey is even more colorful and creative the hobbit is a lot of the same its another journey full of adventure and trolls dwarves and orcs but again it is a quality journey the escapism you feel in this film is like nothing youve ever felt before when it was time to go at the end of the film i didnt want to i was there i was in middle earth ready to take the journey ahead with bilbo gandolff and the band of dwarves i didnt care about length or how long i had been sitting there i was invested that is really all any movie can do 
i only have this two days and ive watched it times what fun it is to be back in middle earth now ill have to go back and watch the lord of the rings set again peter jackson and to all the people who worked on this just wow cant wait till dec for part 
meet bilbo baggins a little hobbit ignoring his own business when he gets unexpected guest and starts an amazing journey that he will not forget this movie is amazing i think the hobbit trilogy will be better than lord of the rings im not saying that lord of the rings is bad i love lord of the rings but i thnik the hobbit will be a little better it is about time they made it i was really happy to see that they stuck pretty much to the book they added a little bit to it but they did not shy from the book which is good thats why its a trilogy i was amazed by the actors performance and i was glad to see the original cast come back this movie is awesome if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
ive been a fan of middle earth for several years now and have looked forward to the release of all of the movies at first i was disappointed when i learned the hobbit was to be turned into three movies but now im excited and pleased by the prospect of three movies for one thing it will give three more opportunities to visit the movie version of middle earth this particular set of discs has something for everybody the d version is effective and i found myself dodging a burning pinecone as it flew at my head the blu ray d version and the dvd also have excellent audio and video and are each enjoyable in their own way one feature that i particularly enjoyed was the special features disc it is filled with fascinating shots of new zealand and most importantly for me the progressive story of the making of the movie told in production videos hosted by peter jackson the videos carry the process of producing the movie from the pre production phase through the production and post production phases to the world premier in new zealand if youve ever wondered what all of those people with strange titles do then you have a chance to not only see what they do but to meet some of them as well i was filled with a new respect for the incredible effort required to produce a movie like the hobbit and get it to the screen it was fun and very entertaining to watch and i recommend it along with the movie itself i look forward even more to movies two and three this one is a keeper and will stand up to repeated viewings i recommend it for the entire family 
i am looking forward to this gift set i dont have the d tv yet but i do have a blue ray and the weta statues are amazing i think this set will be worth every penny i spend on it 
this was an awesome movie and it was neat to see the extended scenes definitely worth buying enjoy it i did
like the extended versions of the lord of the rings films this edition adds back in footage which was deleted primarily to make the theatrical film shorter but whereas each of the lotr extended versions were minutes to an hour longer than their theatrical counterparts the extended edition lengthens the hobbit an unexpected journey by only about minutes i ll speculate this is because the relatively late decision to make the hobbit into three rather than two movies meant there was less leftover material i don t like that there apparently isn t a version which has both the blue ray and dvd extended editions together and so you have to choose one or the other i also don t like that unlike the lotr extended editions this set doesn t include a chart telling you which scenes were added or extended the only documentary included in this set is called new zealand the home of middle earth it s basically a six and a half minute travel promotion which shows how various places on the island nation were turned into parts of tolkien s middle earth it includes an animated map and has various members of the cast talking about the appeal of the country s spectacular scenery it s actually entertaining but it s short the best i can tell the few totally new scenes added in this extended edition are mostly located at the start of each of the two disks the movie has been divided into for this set although they ve all been added to this presentation of the film in sequence of the story rather than as a separate menu of added scenes this means you have to watch the whole film to see the new stuff but it also means you see it in context towards the beginning of the disk one there s a brief new scene where a very young bilbo meets gandalf after the scene where adult bilbo encounters gandalf outside his front door there s a short new scene where bilbo goes into hobbiton to buy the fish which dwalin the dwarf eventually eats at bilbo s table at the beginning of disk two there s four short new scenes all set in the elves city of rivendell in the first bilbo is enjoying a view of the waterfalls from a veranda and lord elrond comes along and has this little conversation with him the two share a moment of humor and depart but it s nice because the theatrical version didn t have these two interacting on a one on one basis at all then there s a wordless scene where bilbo wanders into the hall where the shards of isuldur s famous sword are kept and he sees a painting depicting sauron wielding the one ring then elrond and his assistant come upon the dwarves frolicking in a rivendell fountain there s also a new scene where bilbo and thorin overhear elrond talking to gandalf about the history of mental illness in thorin s family the rest of the new material consists of extended versions of scenes already in the theatrical version in the early scene which sets up the backstory the dwarve s city of erebor and the surrounding human town of dale the extended edition shows a little more how the dwarves and wood elf king thranduil came to be at odds and slightly more of the destruction of dale by the dragon smaug although it really doesn t show any more of that character in the scene where gandalf meets with suramon elrond and galadrial there s an extra bit of conversation where they reference the rings of power and the one ring and suramon expresses his belief that it was washed into the sea and will remain lost forever also in rivendell but towards the end of disk one the scene where the dwarves are eating dinner hosted by the elves is extended with new footage where bofur interrupts the elves harp and flute music to jump onto the table and sing a bawdy pub song and the scene ends with a food fight much to the elves dismay when the dwarves are captured and taken to goblintown this sequence is extended by an additional song by the great goblin and a little more conversation with the dwarves there may be a few extra seconds added elsewhere but these are the ones i noticed a long debate could probably be had over how much the new material really enhances the film after all it really doesn t change anything or add significantly to the plot but for me peter jackson s version of middle earth is a place i love to visit and any chance to linger a little longer is welcome especially when the added footage melds relatively seamlessly with what was in the theatrical version in my opinion if you only want to own one version of this film this would be the one to have 
some background on me its been nearly years since the first time i read the hobbit the hobbit and the lord of the rings are my two favorite novels of all time i own paperback versions that are so old the covers are torn i own newer versions and i bought the kindle versions okay im a little crazy about these books i went to see an unexpected journey with mild trepidation i had read some of the professional reviews my brother saw it before i did and said it dragged but it was peter jackson the man who brought lotr to life so well and id bought the tickets for my year daughter and i to see the imax d version so we went and we loved it can i ask a silly question whats wrong with a story taking its time to tell its tale one can hardly claim that an unexpected journey doesnt have action it certainly does and plenty of it orcs and goblins fighting with dwarves not to mention trolls and giants but the story isnt afraid to breathe to draw things out a little to let us gaze in wonder while we contemplate the wonders that peter jackson crew have bestowed upon us my favorite moment gliding on the wings of eagles through the misty mountains id pictured that moment when i first read the book almost decades ago and jackson captured it perfectly have we been so inundated with movies like transformers with so much action and so little plot that we all have adhd when it comes to watching a movie and for the record i didnt care for the transformers its a fair point that an unexpected journey is not completely faithful to the source material theres a lot of added material and most of it jackson made up on his own but he did that with lotr and i dont see people whining about it now and for the most part the changes made work if pressed id have to say that i wish the troll scene was more like the book maybe its not your cup of tea or pipe weed to smoke but for this hobbit fan i was enthralled i cant wait for the desolation of smaug and my daughter absolutely adores richard armitage my only conundrum buy the theatrical version now or wait for the extended edition thats a tough one no wb im not buying both im leaning towards the theatrical version because although the deleted scenes might be interesting this isnt the lotr where im hoping to see scenes cut from the movie that were in the book like galadriels gifts to the fellowship update conundrum solved thank you directv and pay per view i recorded an unexpected journey off pay per view and burned to a dvd and at i can justify getting the extended edition in the fall hooray now im off to blunt the knives and break the plates 
nothing will ever be as good as the book but that said i really enjoyed the movie it will really take you away on an adventure that you will adore dont listen to the naysayers it is great 
great actors great story cant wait for the next he did a much better job on this first installment of this book than on the lotr series hopefully this trend continues 
classic movie for me and had to have for myself enjoyed the effects and look forward to seeing more in the future check it out for yourself 
the reviews for the lord of the rings the hobbit movies are very confusing this review is for the extended edition disc blu ray of the hobbit an unexpected journey the dvd version is discs if in doubt check the minutes shown in the details of the page i did a review of the extended edition fellowship of the rings it was fantastic and well worth the money as were the extended editions of the other two movies the extended edition for the hobbit is not as fantastic there are a couple scenes that really make you think ohhhh now i get it but thats about it in spite of the minimal changes it is still worth the money in my opinion the additional material is also good not as good as the lord of the rings extended editions but still i have never read the books and he read them but a long time ago so we can not speak to any differences between the books and the movie if you are choosing between buying the extended edition and the original definitely buy the extended edition if you are not a big fan and you already own the original version you might not want to bother if you are a fan even if you own the original version you will probably appreciate the extended edition its a borderline call the packaging is a little different than the extended editions of the lord of the rings but it was designed to be part of that set and that shows i dont care about that really but i understand collectors do until now we have not purchased blu rays but we happened to need another dvd player and the prices for the blu rays have dropped so much we decided to go ahead with the blu ray player we had seen the blu ray movies in stores displayed next to the dvd version of the movies and the difference was amazing still with neither of us being fanatical about picture quality and sound beyond the quite good point it is still more expensive to buy the blu ray discs although they are dropping in price we came to the conclusion that it would be worth it to buy blu rays of movies that were particularly graphic intensive such as the hobbit but for run of the mill movies we would stick with the cheaper dvds we were disappointed with the hobbit on blu ray we had watched the hobbit before on pay per view and we could not see any real difference between the hd and the blu ray in this case the blu ray was actually a dollar or so cheaper so no big deal but dont expect to be stunned by the blu ray this came with a code for a free ultraviolet copy if you dont know what this is please do your research since we did not go out and buy brand new latest and greatest equipment just to watch this movie the free ultraviolet copy was useless it would not play on anything except our new blu ray player and why would we need it for that we have the blu ray disc personally i see the ultraviolet copy as utterly useless and not a selling point for anything at all 
i think its important to judge movies or books or anything else really not based on what i want them to be but what they are attempting to be and thats particularly relevant here peter jacksons the hobbit an unexpected journey is not a direct adaptation of j r r tolkiens beloved childrens story the hobbit and if thats what you want you will be disappointed this is a prequel to the movie trilogy the lord of the rings something that became apparent within the first minutes of the movie its clearly framed as that if you didnt like those movies you wont like this one it is not a stand alone story if you want something that is complete in and of itself you wont like this movie on the other hand if you enjoyed the lord of the rings movies and you like spending time in that vision of middle earth theres no reason why you wouldnt enjoy the prequel visually this is clearly the same place and while the tone is lighter you can see how it would progress to the darkness of lotr a lot has been made of the fact that a small childrens book has been turned into three movies to be honest i always thought it would need two in order to be done thoroughly because the hobbit at some pages depending on the version you have is not actually that short most movies if directly transcribed would really only make up a short story one of the pleasures of an unexpected journey was that everything was there it was frustrating to me in the lord of the rings movies that so much had to be either skipped or rushed and im not even talking about tom bombadil who i dont particularly care for that isnt a problem here in fact the humor and lightness of the hobbit is actually present in the film particularly in the earlier scenes complete with songs and yes we get dwalin balin dori ori nori oin gloin bifur bofur and bombur fili and kili and of course thorin oakenshield all introduced in suitable and largely comic fashion and its a huge credit that despite the huge number of dwarves many of who are not terribly distinctive even in the original text and who in some cases only get a few lines of their own each of them does seem quite distinctive but what jackson fran walsh and philipa boyens have done is to blend those lighter elements into the grimmer back story we get to see what was going on while gandalf was not with the dwarves and this isnt just made up it is based solidly on the material in the appendices from the lord of the rings i should know i read them often enough perhaps that is why i enjoyed the movie as much as i did i love that material and i loved the time it got here i loved that they were able to finally slot radagast in after he was removed from the original trilogy speaking of radagast the brown he had some of my favorite moments in the movie despite that being perhaps the biggest stretch from any actual tolkien text yeah maybe they over egged the drug user references with both the pipe weed sequence and the mushrooms comment but sylvester mccoy honestly did some of his finest work in this movie by this point the tolkien purists will be ready to strangle me im sure but this was not a movie for the purist tolkien in fact would have hated it but then i suspect he hated most movies he disliked technology he didnt like noise and generally speaking he was a grumpy stick in the mud and the movie wasnt made for him either the introduction of the additional material actually helps the narrative considerably in truth the hobbit is a story about a bunch of random events that are tied together with references to luck and fate by emphasizing the back story we get an enemy and something driving the plot forward there are some liberties taken with characterization probably less than in the lord of the rings but the dwarves in general and thorin in particular are less incompetent than they were in the book the same is true of bilbo here who by the end of the movie actually stands up for himself the party are still heavily dependent on gandalf to arrive in the nick of time and save the day but you do get the feeling that if he hadnt they would have gone down fighting rather than totally ineffectually what youre getting here isnt a childrens movie its a modern action movie complete with scenes that might have appeared in a video game jacksons signature swooping camera is very much in evidence and the scale of the sets is huge in terms of acting ian mckellan is of course always brilliant and of the dwarves kenn stott as balin in particular just nails his role in fact if i had seen this first i would have been much more affected by the tomb scene in fellowship of the ring because you can feel a connection between balin and bilbo and you can see why hes respected james nesbit as bofur aidan turner as kilie and richard armitage as thorin all excel in their roles as well and of course there is andy serkis returning to the role of gollum the riddles in the dark sequence is another of my favorite bits in the movie a tense sequence that blends comedy and tension right down to the ending thief thief thief baggins we hates it we hates it we hates it forever which brings me nicely to bilbo baggins himself as portrayed by martin freeman freeman gets to use his comedic chops throughout the movie but also has to dig a bit deeper for some scenes and while some of his mannerism the same ones we saw in the office and sherlock are there within the first minutes i was watching bilbo on screen not martin freeman which brings me on to time this is a long movie the running time is minutes so almost hours i can see that in the cinema i might have found that too much but sitting in the comfort of home with the ability to stop whenever i wanted to get a drink or use the bathroom i had no trouble with the length at all the movie kept me interested the whole time so where does that leave us i loved the movie enjoyed all of it purists will hate it people who just wanted the hobbit will hate it some people may well find it too long and just not be as interested in the middle earth background as i am 
when i heard that the movie of the hobbit had been made into three parts i was totally dumbfounded as to why given thatthe lord of the ringswas made up of three books all of which were longer thank the book of the hobbit but i have seen now the skill in which the hobbit was fleshed out and parts taken from the lord of the rings the silmarillionandunfinished tales of numenor and middle earth the book the hobbit itself lighter in tone than the lord of the rings nevertheless contains many references to things deeper and darker than on the surface such as gondolin the last white council the necromancer and the ring the movie actually brings some of these references into the story much more fully especially the last white council and brings in the great friend of the trees and animals radagast the brown played by sylvester mccoy this movie was certainly as good as the lord of the rings the hobbit is the story of the adventure of bilbo baggins a hobbit of the green and pleasant country of the shire recruited by the wizard gandalf once again ian mckellen excels in the role and a company of dwarves led by thorin oakenshield played with majesty and gravitas to wrest the dwarves lost homeland of erebor from the dragon smaug under the lonely mountain the company must first battle trolls goblins wargs and comes into contact with elves eagles men and other inhabitants of tolkiens wonderful world each of the dwarves has its own character and is played with skill and entertainingly so great recreation of rivendell the reappearance of hugo weaving as elrond and kate blanchett as galadriel the full grotesque loathsomeness of orc chieftains such as the revolting great goblin barry humphries and the sheer evil of the orc king azog manu bennett highlights include bilbos encounter with gollum andy serkis and the great concluding scene with the eagles a must see visual feast and does the magic of tolkien justice 
i got this to go with my lord of the rings series i do like the d in this my grandson told me it was supposed to be good in d and i was not disappointed 
watched the first part as soon as i got done reading this portion of the book its not exact to the book but the script definitely follows true to the spirit of the story they did a great job the cinematography was great it always amazes me how they scale the hobbits in to the film and make it look absolutely perfect great movie and a must own if you are a tolkien fan

fans of tolkien can argue about peter jackson s handling of the beloved stories of middle earth what he left out or changed but no one has accused him of getting in wrong and considering the legions of fans all working from books that is a heck of a thing a fan himself jackson treats tolkien s works with the love and respect any fan would hope for after lord of the rings films fans were looking forward to the hobbit the first prequel to lotr s in which we see a younger bilbo baggins get swept up in an adventure with the wizard gandalf and a troop of dwarves to rescue their home land from the dragon smaug who captured it years ago as with his earlier films jackson does not disappoint ian mckellan returns as the wizard and martin freeman known to most as dr watson from sherlock is wonderful as the easily flustered fish out of water gentle hobbit who finds himself in the wilds that having been said if you bought the dvd of the hobbit when it first came out months ago sad to say there really isn t a reason to buy the extended version with the three lotr films jackson was unsure of his audience so the theatrical releases were only hours long with his true vision coming through on the hour long versions released on dvd it was worth it to buy those with the first of the hobbit films though jackson knew what he had and that audiences would support him it was about hours long and when i heard extended version one can rightly ask what the heck extra was there a very brief scene of the young bilbo meeting gandalf there is a scene of a flustered bilbo in a market in hobbiton and i m not really sure why it was included it was obvious why it was cut a little more a very little more development of some of the dwarves who got little exposure in the film version a bit more development of rivendell the elven strong hold which plays up the dwarves being someone uncouth compared with their hosts an over heard conversation between gandalf and elrond where they see this as a move in a long war against sauron not just a quest for its own sake and a conversation between bilbo and the elf lord elrond lastly a song by the goblin king about being down in goblin town yes it was in the book but on the screen you suddenly feel like it s a s b film that has to have a musical number shoehorned in the behind the scenes discs are interesting if you haven t seen them on the original lotr s discs but if you have seen those older ones there really isn t too much new on these still my point is jackson has once more created a beautiful version of the works of tolkien that any fan would be happy to own and if you didn t buy the original version when it came out but held out for the extended version then yes buy it you ll love it but if you bought it when it first came out then there really isn t enough here to justify the additional expense 
right before christmas i asked my mother if she wanted to watch the lord of the rings trilogy and she said yes we got done watching it a couple of weeks ago now we are ready to watch this the hobbit part i saw it by myself and it was awesome cant wait for the nd and the rd one if you liked the lord of the rings trilogy you will love this and the remaining movies to come 
peter jackson has laced together a delightful film for the young at heart stodgy oldtimers forget the times when the world was a mystery in which youngsters feared every day would be the same as yesterday absolutely nothing that ever happened was ever unexpected all the giants had been slain and all the dragons gone away taking on a classic is admirable stuff approaching the hobbit in what seems to be so soon following the monumental lord of the rings trilogy was simply courageous expectations are immeasurable individual demands are often impossible to meet and finishing even the introduction to the hobbit tale in this oversized age of media hype can be deemed missing the mark yet those who love the masterful telling of a great tale will be enthralled with joy at the spectacle of new things found in old attic boxes and for any who battle against looking to the future take along a young one with you and watch the wonder of life unfold through their eyes if youve seen lotr you must see the hobbit if you havent you still must see the hobbit more holiday viewing sherlock holmes blu ray sherlock holmes a game of shadows movie only edition ultraviolet digital copy blu ray tl farley author distant reaches autobiography from a pub in ireland to a state police interrogation 
i already have the regular version i have a d tv and so i got the d version of the hobbit i really enjoyed the d version the landscapes look beautiful in d 
peter jacksons extended editions are always worth the wait and the hobbit extended edition is no exception in addition to adding back scenes that were cut for the theatrical release which other reviewers have mentioned there are an amazing discs of bonus coverage totaling almost hours just as j r r tolkien had appendices to his books jacksons movies have appendices these extraordinary making of features for the hobbit carry on the numbering from the lord of the rings trilogy the extended edition release for return of the king ended with appendices part so the hobbit begins with appendices part these are extraordinarily detailed glimpses into the creation of this movie from the very beginning to the very end long before any actors were notified they worked on production design and concepts character designs and concepts scripts were changed right up to the day of shooting motion capture was brought to new levels costuming and the decisions that went into it are fascinating you see clips from rehearsals and clips from rushes clips from meetings and makeup and why this was done instead of that very often they start with quotes from tolkien how he described something someone and how jackson writer director coproducer could work off of that commentators include every actor and i think just about everybody on the crew too from the concept creature sculptor to the animation technician desperately trying to finish azog almost right up to the day of the new zealand world premiere you will not be bored by watching these many hours of extra features all features can be listened to in english subtitles are available in english francais espa ntilde ol portuguse and four more languages bonus disc the appendices part a introduction by peter jackson minutes b a long

studios i cant say we actually panicked its fabulous watching the rehearsals of frodo and gollum in the cave with andy serkis in his motion capture suit and doing that voice ian mckellen plays gandalf remembers that when filming the ring trilogy years earlier he was made to look larger by putting me the larger character closer to the camera but as the hobbit is shot in d that system doesnt work alex funke motion control supervisor describes how it was done for the hobbit the only way we can make a person bigger is to put the camera closer to him so effectively in the dinner scene in frodos home we have a camera that looks at the dwarves and bilbo in a set built to their scale and a camera that looks at gandalf on a green screen which is closer to him on a smaller scale kitchen set except it isnt really a set because everything is draped in green fabric the two cameras are synchronized but mckellen could not hear anything on the other set this was very disconcerting at first and when you look at the conditions its amazing it works its touching as mckellen describes how he was so upset after the st day of shooting in the green room bag end that he considered hed have to leave the movie ikhf id ursu khazad feel the fire of the dwarves nevui penim miruvor we are almost out of wine c the songs of the hobbit minutes one of the most fun songs in the movie is down down to goblin

more idyllic time i mean the darkness that descends on this world in lord of the rings is brewing but it hasnt yet expanded to the levels its going to for the ring trilogy most of hobbiton was made of styrofoam and torn down afterwards and still tourists made pilgrimages this time around they built the hobbit holes and structures as in real life they are made to last now you really can visit a bag end bonus disc the appendices part return to middle earthyou can watch the four parts individually or play all a the company of thorin hour minutes tolkiens books dont give a lot of definition for many of the dwarf personalities for a movie though each of the dwarves in the party has to have his own characteristics which drives his costume and weapons so it was left to jackson team as well as the actors to fill everything in adam brown plays ori says this is my first movie i thought id aim high b mr baggins the th member minutes ian mckellen the old pro says of martin freeman his most remarkable quality as an actor is to be able with absolute clarity to convey that hes thinking two things at the same time c durins folk creating the dwarves minutes richard armitage plays thorin went through many mutations on his costuming tolkien described thorin as having a full beard that he tucked into his belt we have had to depart from that i know this is controversial because the king of the the long beards people felt he should have a long beard graham mctavish plays the bulkier even for a dwarf dwalin i just thought that dwalin would have names for his axes because hes that kind of guy i remembered that emily br ouml nte had two dogs called grasper and keeper what an extraordinary pair of names and they became the names of his axes d the peoples and denizens of middle earth total hours you can watch the four parts individually or play all the stone trolls radagast the brown goblins azog the defilersylvester mccoy plays the wizard radagast whos practically turned into a forest creature himself mccoy didnt learn he had to say a spell in formal elvish until he got on set mccoy says they tell me when i first arrive and i misheard and i thought it was elvis and he goes into an elvis impersonation he is better at the elvish in the book azog apparently dies of his injury at thorins hand in the battle for moria with a little artistic license they brought him back for the hobbit lusting for thorins head manu bennet the actor whos motion capture was used for azog talks about his character the necessary thing that peter wanted from azog was what we maori call mana the size of the guy the spiritual strength of the character 
i liked the original theatrical cut but i very much liked the additional footage that peter jackson seemlessly added to the film for me the most important addition was the added encounter in the prologue between the elves and the dwarves giving an explanation as to why the elves dont come to the aid of the dwarves but i loved the goblin song they added too in my opinion completely worth the upgrade 
seems like with the hobbit movies its like it was with the lord of the rings trilogy each movie was better then the previous one so we cant wait for the third movie in this series because if it holds the same as with the lotr movies its going to be even better then the desolation of smaug so hope to see you all at the theaterbc
love this movie love all of tolkeins work and peter jackson really is doing a great job with it i cant wait for the second one which happens to be coming out on my birthday 
after slogging through all hours whatever of the extended lord of the rings i avoided the hobbit in theaters yes it is too long no it really doesnt need to be a trilogy but the d is excellent almost as good as hugo and i actually enjoyed it more on the nd and rd viewings martin freeman i thought was an odd choice as bilbo until about minutes into the movie freeman was brilliant casting and his performance is a revelation his expressions and reactions establish the character and enhance the viewing the performance is so good it almost makes up for the clunky pacing a couple of minutes of walking a couple minutes of talking a few minutes of fighting followed by a few minutes of walking i am really looking forward to the next film in theaters even 
we thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was very well done great visuals scripting was well thought out and moved along and the script was full of adventure and true to the original book the visuals were seamless from the lord of the rings trilogy all and all it was excellent looking forward to the next three installments of peter jackson 
i usually dont review something before it comes out but as one reviewer already mentioned i feel i should balance out some of the negative reviews for something that i have enough confidence and knowledge of to know its going to be a great buy for people especially the fans the additional scenes mentioned by a reviewer can be verified for those willing to do a little searching on the net and like the lotr extended editions they will make an already great movie better im a big tolkien fan and i dont think anyone could have put these books to movies any better than what peter jackson and his team have done the statue and the work put into it looks fantastic its theme riddles in the dark is one of the best parts of the book and now movie for those who are big fans of lotr and the hobbit i feel its worth buying editions like these because this time with the hobbit it is confirmed by jackson himself the last time through middle earth for him and the movie theaters there wont be any simarillion movies etc its great the hobbit happened at all because it was looking like it wasnt going to happen for years 
you may read that some will say this isnt worth getting if you have the original version i completely disagree the additional scenes add depth to the characters which i believe may prove to be of value as the story progresses i will be purchasing the extended edition for all the hobbit series 
okay lets be honest here this movie is waaaaay too long there are too many battle scenes characters are not developed enough the story line is a little thin and yet i loved every overlong minute the incredible acting by ian mckellan who else can bring such gravitas to a fantasy role and martin freeman loved him in sherlock and love him even more as bilbo and the breathtaking landscape make the hobbit an unexpected guilty pleasure feel free to hit pause every once in a while and take a break if you need to its well worth the journey the bonus features at the end are funny and informative too although i am left wondering if peter jackson ever combs his hair 
three hours in middle earth pursued by orcs pummeled by rock hurling giants evading goblins and trolls is exhausting but so satisfying the hobbit an unexpected journey is close to perfect in the spirit of the book its a gentler more playful adventure than lotr though the perils are no less deadly martin freemans bilbo is marvelous in turns petulant vulnerable and heroic and his evolution from complacent comfort seeker to resourceful rescuer is wonderful to watch as good as freeman is andy serkis steals the movie the riddle scene between bilbo and gollum is some of the most riveting screen time ever serkis so deserves a major award not a leg lamp for his tormented schizophrenic gollum that scene alone makes this movie a must see all the acting is splendid and cameos from lotr characters preserve the continuity of the story but somehow the hobbit manages to be more fun than was lotr if at all possible see it in d the only thing missing is smell but after bilbos and thorins reaction to essence de goblin thats ok peter jackson never ceases to amaze and the hobbit is a must see i cant wait for the next installment 
fans of tolkien and fantasy films rejoice director peter jackson has conjured the impossible again in this long awaited return to middle earth the hobbit an unexpected journey that serves as a most compelling prequel to the lord of the rings trilogy and as a spectacular start to his the hobbit trilogy purists may decry the fact that jackson has added some characters from the lord of the rings films but they will have forgotten that virtually all of them are accounted for in tolkiens appendices to the lord of the rings and in the unfinished tales whatever liberties taken by jackson and his screenwriting collaborators including his the lord of the rings collaborators philippa boyen and fran walsh and guillermo del toro who was designated originally as the director of two the hobbit films remain consistent with tolkiens spirit and vision of middle earth especially with its prior history before the events chronicled in the hobbit and then sixty years later the lord of the rings once more we are treated to epic filmmaking of a grand scale with new zealand standing in for middle earth those who are especially familiar with the first movie the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring will recognize much of the middle earth countryside from the shire to rivendell and beyond but the scenery is merely the stage for the events which unfold for which jackson has assembled again a most impressive cast of actors to tell a gripping saga of truly monumental proportions ample praise should be bestowed on richard armitage for his heroic portrayal as the dwarf king thorin oakenshield leading his small band of dwarves on an all but hopeless quest fraught with ample danger and martin freeman as the younger more vigorous bilbo baggins portrayed by ian holm in the lord of the rings films fans of doctor who will barely recognize sylvester mccoy hidden in his nature tinged makeup as the wizard radagast but his fine performance as the middle earth wizard will remind some of his decades old portrayal of the doctor of the other returning cast members from the lord of the rings films cate blanchett galadriel hugo weaving elrond christopher lee saruman and andy serkus gollum are splendid in their all too brief screen appearances so too are two others whom i wont mention simply to prevent myself from divulging any further spoilers there are intense scenes of physical and psychological combat throughout much of the film the war of words that persist with signs of mistrust between dwarves and elves between a dwarf and a hobbit are almost as riveting as the sword fighting between dwarves and orcs or in a spectacular battle deep within the bowels of one mountain as the dwarves flee the great goblin portrayed by barry dame edna humphries and his army much of the films cinematic pacing will remind fans of jacksons the lord of the ring the return of the king especially in its battles which are fast forward climatic and intense despite a rather sluggish first half hour or so accompanied by the familiar sounds of the london philharmonic orchestra playing howard shores almost wagnerian film score which is compelling to listen in its own right even with frequent borrowing of musical leitmotifs from the ring films jackson his cast and technical crew held me spellbound for hours with barely a dull moment or two save for the films first half hour dont believe any negative reviews written by professional film critics and others if the hobbit an unexpected journey can be seen by most as a compellingly first rate example of cinematic storytelling at its best then i have high hopes that the other two films in the hobbit trilogy will be compared favorably with the lord of the ring trilogy a feat that no visionary hollywood director or producer has ever accomplished especially george lucas in his star wars prequel trilogy welcome back peter jackson and thank you for leading us on yet another spectacular cinematic adventure through middle earth long time tolkien fans will truly feel like they have left home and come back again i for one know that i will take an unexpected journey again soon at my nearest movie theater 
after seeing the lord of the rings trilogy in all its glory i was not expecting any less from peter jackson for the hobbit i was a bit aprehensive about how it would come across in d some d movies are great but some really fall short of being successful this movie was phemomenal it is the best d movie i have ever seen and the action is non stop from beginning to end special effects have gone far beyond lotr in this film and i am really anticipating what they do to smaug it has to be the most fantastic dragon ever created i first read the hobbit and the lord of the rings trilogy back in the sixties and still own the original paperbacks as well as some very nice hardbound collector sets i never expect any movie to be just like the book it would be impossible as a serious lotr fan i was very pleased with the lotr trilogy on film and i am equally happy with the way the first segment of the hobbit was translated to the screen it is just so exciting seeing so many of the characters i read about come to life and the best part of owning a movie like this is being able to watch it as frequently as i wish i have been waiting patiently for the release of this movie in blu ray d i have invested a great deal in a big screen d tv and home theater system and even though there arent many truely great d movies available yet this one has moved to the top of the list it is an outstanding film and i can hardly wait for the extended version to be released i dont mind investing in both the theatrical version and the extended version i am a lotr collector and have every version of the trilogy that was made i will most likely do the same with the hobbit trilogy 
wow this film was a great rather long adventure but its only the beginning ha this film unlike what everyone else is saying is trully a work of art this film is sadly under estimated everyone is really just angry because they had to sit through a hour film but hey my motto is the longer the film is the more money its worth unlike the lord of the ring series this film can be easily understood by people like me who have not read the book i understand this movie might be alittle to much for everyone to like but if you clear your thoughts and just think to yourself this is going to be the best then it will be the best but if you dont go in open minded you are going to find everything wrong with the film now on to the actual reviewing i only have good news to review to you all the good stuff includes the acting cast visual effects length costumes new frame rate and much much more ok the acting is excellent i loved it the spotlight is on martin freeman richard armitage and andy serkis martin freeman plays our funny little hobbit man in this jorney out of the three he is the best i loved him and his acting skills in the film he put lots of effert into this film and he did well just as in sherlock he is great in acting and even though andy serkis is only in the film for about minutes he uses his time wishly to make an impression on the audience and he succeeds very well he is the most memerable acting of the three and finally richard armitage who gives a very realistic proformance sorta a sad angry man with mixed emotions he really expresses his charactors emotions dont get me wrong everyone elses acting was great too but those three stood out the most to me the cast was super peter jackson knows what he is doing when casting the actors every actor matches the charactors personalitly which is often rare but peter knows what he is doing the dwarfs actors looked like they would as dwarfs and its just great casting the visual effects are so great they are so well detailed i meanman peter score two you made the monsters look so real it is just so cool the animation is beautifully done they looked like they were worked on for close to a year it was just oh my god great like life of pi it was really good visual effecst that look so real and well detailed that it looks like they are really getting thrown or coming after the dwarfs i dont know why everyone is always so angry and hating peter jacksons length in his films everyone hated that king kong was hours but i didnt i just thought it was even better that wed be able to see more excellent film this film needed the longer running time to give us enough to walk out of the theater feeling like oh my gosh i must see more ad its true that how i felt the costumes were like really cool and well detailed they looked really old fashioned and neat they just blended with the actors really well and fit with the time period most people hate the new frame rate saying that it looks to really or the charactors move to fast well you want to know what i say i think it makes it look great and more clear and realistic looking in a good way i just loved it really i dont care how fast the charactors can pick up items i dont pay much attention to that i mean does it really matter all i know is that it works well the only other things i have to mention is the goblin king scene and the dwarfs i found the line the gobin king says stupid as well as him being so easy to defeat he says well i guess it is that easy when he takes a swing and gandalf hits his head and then slits his belly like he was nothing but he was like huge the other thing is they didnt spend any time really on developing the dwarfs there are just to many maybe if they had acouple die by the end then it would have been better but they didnt and that is not good well all an all the hobbit was put in the hands of excellent people who knew what they were doing and actually cared about making this film a winner p s i recommend seeing in theaters a 
evidently those writing negative reports have never read the book that the movie is based on this movie follows the book well and even some scenes are straight from artwork about the book and also included in the book this movie is treat for any real tolkien fan 
where elijah wood played his hobbit frodo as a picture of childlike innocence in a big world martin freeman plays bilbo as a flustered everyman his essential edwardian englishness based on predictability and decorum and stability is almost the exact opposite of the dwarves he accompanies led by richard armitage who will surely become a name star behind this film and that tension drives this story forward tolkiens mythmaking which is perhaps less sophisticated than in the lord of the rings but no less compelling relies on two visions of england the dwarves eager to reclaim their homeland are an older more virile england that of shakespeare wellington and the norman conquests bilbo with his corduroy jacket and pipe is the inward turning england of the years after the empire take away either and england would lose its englishness bilbo thinks the dwarves savage unkempt and barbaric the dwarves consider bilbo sedentary effete and useless director peter jackson plays this out longer and more explicitly than tolkien did in his book which took such distinctions as written this film is about how the young man and the old man cant stand each other even as they need each other and the one gradually turns into the other jackson takes pains to emphasize this films connections to his previous lotr trilogy finding ways to incorporate sets and characters from the prior films whether or not they were in the book but he also distinguishes this film from the prior its humor is more explicit and its characters more archetypal less gritty and as a story involving no humans this movie is more absolutely fantasy than jacksons prior trilogy it would have been easy for peter jackson to produce lotr redux and it probably would have made him even more famous but he thankfully makes this a different movie with its own identity and themes he takes risks where he could have played it safe alternates smartly between boldness and subtlety and spends more time than before on themes that difference is what makes this movie work so well 
i wont wade into the war currently being waged between tolkien purists and peter jackson loyalists over the changes jackson made to bilbos story as told in this film adaptation at least not very deeply suffice it to say that these changes are many and some of them are huge departures from the original story that were hard for me to swallow the first time i saw this movie in a cinema however i have to say that much of the extra footage in this extended edition is crucial and i wish it had been included in the theatrical version if you are wondering if the extra for this extended edition is worth it i would answer that as an unqualified yes if you have never seen this film and your purchase of this bluray will be your first viewing of it let me just say that martin freeman does a very good job of portraying a younger bilbo baggins he doesnt look like ian holm did as bilbo in lotr but i think he projects the spirit and attitudes of tolkiens bilbo very nicely if you can accept that this film was made to make oodles of money for the producers and appeal to and entertain as wide an audience as possible and if you keep it in mind that years have passed since j r r tolkiien wrote the original story hopefully you can keep an open mind about peter jacksons handling of the plot lines and story and just enjoy it as an entertainment you might want to consider that the additions in this film flesh out some characters like radagast and saruman that were barely mentioned in tolkiens novel of the hobbit and that other changes add links to tie the hobbit and the lord of the rings together more seamlessly whether or not these changes were too drastic is up to you to judge personally i appreciate the extra element of pure storytelling pleasure i got from most of jacksons additions i also want to note that ian mckellan gandalf cate blanchett galadriel hugo weaving elrond andy serkis smeagol gollum and christopher lee saruman all reprise their lotr characters wonderfully and the fact that this movie actually takes you inside the white council which the novel just barely mentions is great and im glad that peter jackson provided time for it in the screenplay without the white council scene cate blanchett and christopher lee would not have had parts in this film and their characters are fun to watch so throw some popcorn in the microwave and get settled in your most comfortable chair this is a long movie hours minutes and you wont want to pause it at least not on the first viewing enjoy 
naturally this is a wonderful film with beautiful scenery shot in new zealand i enjoyed the extra footage with interviews with the cast director and production crew 
im pretty sure that its hard for anybody not to like this so this review probably wont matter much to anyone probably since there are like reviews on this move so this review will probably get overlooked but id still like to say a few things on how good this movie is first i really like how close to the book it is sure there is allot of dialogue added and a few scenes that are added on to the original ones but for the most part the plot itself is pretty faithful to the book ive seen allot of movies made off books that are just so messed up because theyre like different from the original book and most of the scenes added are just plain stupid but they dont do this here just goes to show how committed the makers of lotr were carful to make this one just as good and pure as there previous lotr trilogy and for any scenes that were added on that werent original theyre just as good as if they came from the original book second the characters are really well developed and personalized for example in the original book allot of the dwarfs are only used one or two times and it doesnt go into allot of detail about allot of them but in the movie they make each dwarf unique and each one has there own memorable specialty that would make tolkien proud its easier to connect with the characters in a story when you know each one well and are able to start caring for them tolkien wasnt able to do all of that since he had so many characters to deal with in his story but this movie shows the characters in full colors showing there personality special look and so forth you can actually have a favorite dwarf in the movie when in the book you didnt know each one will enough to decide and third the movie itself is just really good it seems like this days all the movie producers will just take the cheap way out and do all there filming in the studio but not in this movie the previous producers of lotr lived up to the legend of the previous middle earth trilogy making this movie a real grand spectacle among allot of other movies made today the wilderness scenes look so real beautiful and captivating and all the structures buildings and such look very real the clothing isnt done with cheap very fake looking material but done with professional patterns that really fit into that world the props used such as weapons hats plates and other stuff also look quite real and thats hard to do as this movie was shot at a frame rate of frames per second making all the details really stand out that means that they hade to pay extra attention to the detail of the sets props and all the other aspects of the film really makes you appreciate more the work of its producers and it does look fantastic so with that said it looks like this is a very great movie call it what you want you may just not like it for the story the characters or anything like that but you must gives high starts for its production and i dont see how anybody could not like the story im pretty sure that pretty much everybody has seen this move so everybody should have there own opinion but i hope that this review helps add on to your opinions and helps shape them more i think ill just close out with this this is a very good film and a masterpiece that surely stands out as one of the greatest films of all time 
ill admit im not all of the way through things yet but there is a heck of a lot on this set to get through ive watched the film i was certainly curious what new footage would be added to what was already a somewhat embellished some less kind people may even say bloated version of the tale of the hobbit the additions actually worked quite nicely the addition of the goblin town song was worth the proverbial price of admission alone i havent listened to the commentary track but i look forward to it it is a bit disappointing to only have one track as i enjoyed the each of four that were on the various extended lotr films but i wont hold that against this release i will enjoy what we do have rather then lament what i wish we could have had what i have done is gotten part way through the appendices im three hours into the roughly nine hours worth of documentary footage this is what i was most looking forward to on this release and most worried might not live up to my expectations what were those expectations well when it came to the lord of the rings the excellent behind the scenes material within the appendices wove a tale that was in my opinion just as compelling as that within the narrative of the films i felt like i got to know not only the usual suspects of the actors and the director but many of the other usually invisible people who worked on the film i felt like i was taken along on the journey with them i became emotionally invested in their tale i felt genuine sadness as the filming of the return of the king came to the end and everyone started saying goodbye to each other i felt as if i was saying goodbye to them as well it had just the same if not greater emotional impact as within the film itself when frodo was saying goodbye to sam as he was preparing to pass into the west this was a lot to live up to would the behind the scenes tale of the hobbit be able to recapture that magic well i am only three hours in about a third of the way into what will theoretically be only a third of the final tale once the last part of the hobbit comes out and i am pleased to say that it looks like the magic has been recaptured i feel like i am seeing old friends once again and meeting new friends along with them i feel like i am reliving fond memories and forming new ones their tale can still tug at me and i am glad to be along for the ride once more 
this movie is freaking amazing i was getting really worried before going to see it because of some negative reviews but there is nothing to worry about if you loved the lord of the rings movies especially the extended editions then you will love the hobbit too a little bit about me i grew up on the animated movies read the books when i was in sixth grade and have reread them several times over the years im a huge fan but not a purist and saw each of the live action films several times in the theaters i took a class on tolkien in college and knew more about the books than even the teacher lol went to view the original manuscripts at marquette university in milwaukee twice and borrowed most of the history of middle earth books from the library but just skimmed them im pretty familiar with much of the appendices deleted chapters abandoned attempts at revising the hobbit and sequelizing lord of the rings etc ive been waiting for the hobbit since and have been following the production online when it was announced months ago that peter jackson was splitting the story into films after already completing production on the film adaptation my heart sank its not that i was opposed to turning the hobbit into a trilogy despite that its meant to be a childrens story and not an epic but i just didnt think there was enough story and it seemed like a cash grab that would probably destroy the pacing but peter jackson hasnt let me down before and so i held out hope in fact the more i heard him talk about giving the dwarves a bit more character development and backstory and adding in all the stuff about the white council i began to look forward to it when a couple weeks ago reviews starting coming in saying that as i had first feared the movie dragged and the pacing was terrible i prepared myself for disappointment even though hardcore fans on messageboards like theonering net who had seen the movie early kept saying it was terrific the negative reviews from professional critics kept coming in the movie is bloated and dull and misses the point they said and so i was very nervous going to see the movie this afternoon im pleased to say that not only is the movie incredible but its on par with the lord of the rings movies i havent felt this way about a movie since fellowship of the ring years ago i havent been able to stop thinking about it all night and i cant wait till i can go see it again i sat in the theater for nearly three hours with the biggest grin on my face the entire time the movie didnt feel bloated or stretched thin to me i was worried that there would be all these scenes that went on too long or belonged on the cutting room floor but i cant think of anything i would have left out it was like watching the book acted out on the screen in front of me with really great acting music and production values the cinematography has really improved in the last years wow this movie is beautifully shot howard shores music is once again great though there are some little deletions and changes from the original soundtrack the only one that really bugged me though was the use of the nazgul theme over thorin fighting azog there was better music there in the original soundtrack and changing it was a horrible decision i love the added stuff with the white council necromancer its all there in tolkiens appendices and in unfinished tales and blasphemy for saying so depending on how this continues to play out over the next two movies i may end up liking this even better than the book either the next film or the one after that will have the battle of dol goldur and from what ive heard we will see gandalf saruman radagast and galadriel battling werewolves and giant spiders as they try to drive out the necromancer i can just imagine how awesome that will be if peter jackson pulls it off and yes this felt to me like a complete movie one of the reasons i originally hated the idea of a trilogy was i expected to feel short changed by only seeing a small fraction of the story and then having to wait another year but i felt like there was plenty of story and they got into plenty of adventures my only nitpicks are few i liked the design of the great goblin but i thought he acted way too cartoony my other is there were a couple times where bilbo and the dwarves fell from a height of like feet and just got back up they would have been killed i also thought the character azog was fine but why did he have to be all cgi why couldnt it have been an actor in makeup like lurtz in fellowship of the ring those are really my only nitpicks though as i sat in the theater i had a feeling like this is one of the best filmgoing experiences ive ever had i had the same feeling watching lord of the rings as someone who originally hated the idea of making this into a trilogy now i say bring it on update i got to see the movie in frames per second hfr d yesterday i had only seen it in regular fps d before fps has been the standard for film since the silent movie days the hobbit is the first movie to be shot at fps to give it a sharper look unfortunately the technology is new so only a few theaters are equipped to even show it at fps many of the reviewers were saying they hated it that it looks like a bbc tv movie i was still curious to give it a try because its new technology and its how peter jackson intended you to see the movie but i didnt want it to distract from my first viewing if i ended up not liking it so we saw the movie first at fps d anyway i liked it and i didnt think it looked cheap or like a soap opera at all it looked really sharp and there were some parts where the people looked like they were really right in front of you in addition to that motion blur is completely gone now and ive heard from other people who get headaches from watching d movies that they were fine watching this one thanks to the fps peter jackson has confirmed that there will be an extended edition dvd blu ray like they did with the lord of the rings movies so you may want to hold out from buying the theatrical dvd when it comes out and get the extended edition 
this movie is the first of three movies about the ring seen in the lord of the rings i havent seen it yet
i want to have tea with ian mckellen kbe the reason i say that its better the second time is because in part of bilbo baggins martin freemans performance is like a new pair of shoes that after time become your favorite i must say i was not comfortable at first with him as bilbo such large epics now i see a extended version is on the way have so much going on you have to see it more than once to appreciate all the details this is true with mr freemans performance i now totally appreciate him as the younger bilbo thank you mr jackson for another adventure 
peter jackson has done it again this movie is just great simply put i saw it times in the theater i liked it so much 
loved this movie great action and story the hobbit is fun to watch just like the lord of the rings movies 
i bought this and when i got it i realized i had already bought this movie a while back lol well guess i will give this as a christmas gift to a friend of mine love the cgi in this movie awesome awesome awesome no more words to express this movie havent seen the new one yet but i will and look forward to it 
i have a feeling the next two films in the hobbit trilogy will be even better but an unexpected journey is still a beautiful and engaging piece of movie magic the acting by martin freeman as bilbo baggins ian mckellan as gandalf and all the dwarves were great the man and voice behind gollum also has a memorable minutes of screen time the cgi is of the highest calibur but i did miss the real make up effects used for the orcs in lotr almost all the faces and bodies of the orcs are pure cgi here i think many critics are being far to harsh though the majority still liked it this is much smaller in scale than the lotr but its is still filled with wonderful characters action music and another amazing quest we will have to wait another two years to complete imax d is the way to go if possible which includes a minute scene from the new star trek into darkness film 
the hobbit on blu ray is one of the finest looking blu rays in my collection as to the d version i cant say since my projector doesnt support d but on release day it was the same price as the d version so i bought it as my next projector will most likely have d support if you like the lotr movies you should equally enjoy the hobbit ian mckellen is excellent and martin freeman is brilliant as a young bilbo while im slightly annoyed by the fact that they are stretching this into movies i love middle earth and would probably keep going to see the movies if they are well made and there was a hundred of them 
who could not love this movie if you like movies at all 
the short wonderfully cast incredibly shot relentlessly adventurous and an almost spot on adaptation of the beloved classic the first chapter in this highly anticipated trilogy doesnt disappoint in the slightest while it does stumble slightly in the beginning the experience as a whole is one of the most enjoyable films of the year and while it does take some getting used to the fps presentation in d imax is absolutely the best format to experience this journey its been nearly a decade since we last entered middle earth as envisioned by peter jackson theres no denying that the return of the king was going to be a hard act to follow so lets just get this straight right off the bat the hobbit an unexpected journey is no where near the caliber of the final chapter we saw in what the hobbit an unexpected journey turns out to be is an unexpected but necessary and welcome change to peter jacksons landscape of middle earth the hobbit an unexpected journey features a memorable cast but the standout is no doubt martin freeman as bilbo he completely nails bilbos character armitage is also fantastic as thorin and ian mckellen as gandalf is back again and still great the rest of the supporting cast is good but only a handful of the dwarves get significant screen time the technical wizardry is also of note no doubt its not truly noticeable until the latter part of the movie where the special effects are absolutely incredible the rest of the movie is absolutely stunning the battle of erebor the escape from the goblin stronghold the fights with orcs everything is incredibly animated and beautifully done in fps the action does take some getting used to the higher frame rate removes the standard blur of special effects in the higher frame rate one can see all the nuances of the special effects making each animated character or item look ultra artificial or incredibly real but a good minutes into the movie and the presentation felt completely normal and in fact made some of the later scenes look absolutely spectacular i cant stress enough that once your senses have adapted the fps visuals are unlike anything else howard shores original score is his bet yet for sure every bit of his original music captures the sweeping scale of the adventure but its the new theme that is still playing through my head even now the first time you hear the haunting new theme it will stick to you but by the time it is blasting over action scenes it will send chills down your spine original themes from tlotr trilogy make brief returns in just the right places as well overall its howard shores best work yet the hobbit an unexpected journey is more of a change of scenery from the past trips to middle earth its subject material is much lighter the action is much more sparse and the character building is considerably different and in terms of being faithful to the beloved classic aside from the added radagast sub plot and the added white orc which made more sense from a cinematic adaptation standpoint and a change that i prefer the hobbit is pretty faithful to the original story i will admit that the beginning is sluggish and overall a little too drawn out the goblin king looks like he was stripped out of a video game and there are some inconsistencies here and there so when it comes down to it the hobbit an unexpected journey is not perfect far from it actually it wont win any awards it wont be favored among the critics there are some silly choices made and it isnt the most tightly crafted piece of film but i could care less this movie is adventurous exciting funny all while capturing the original essence and character of the classic novel the stunning special effects great performances and incredible score make this a memorable return trip but what truly stands out is peter jacksons eye for adventure there just hasnt been a quality adventure movie in a long while the hobbit an unexpected journey is the perfect antidote its big epic filmmaking with a purpose to tell a story albeit the long winded way thats grand in scale rooted deep within its characters make time to see this movie and go into it with excitement because the hobbit an unexpected journey is a great deal of fun and makes one thing inevitable above all else the wait for the hobbit the desolation of smaug is going to be incredibly painful while flawed the hobbit an unexpected journey is tremendously entertaining 
peter jackson delivered the first film of the hobbit trilogy to a great deal less acclaim than was received by any of the films in the lord of the rings cycle when i first saw the hobbit in digital frame per second projection i did not understand the disappointment i thought the film fully delivered and the extended edition delivers even more without doubt i can say that this will become the version i look to when i wish to screen the series this film down not have as much new material as was added to the films in the first trilogy undoubtedly jackson has the confidence of the studios and can now create and deliver a tolkien film of virtually whatever length he wants theres no need to leave out a story line to save time i cant imagine a studio executive getting nervous over peter jackson and fran walsh and phillipa boyens working with this material consequently there is less meat to pack onto the bones whats there though is at least pleasing and at best thrilling i never thought id get lotr or the hobbit on film with such care or that the films would become such popular successes my son to whom i read shelobs lair at age and i agree that this is a multi million dollar fan project and everyone else can just come along for the ride thankfully there are millions of fans i have not yet completed the appendices but what i have viewed gives me full faith and confidence that team jackson is packing in detail far past the ordinary making of featurettes the package also includes this little statue little hah of gollum regarding bilbo from above just before starting their game of riddles in the dark its lovely and worth the cost of the item entirely on its own the video and audio viewed on a dlp screen with dts hd master sound is delightful the package is a total winner and makes me even more eager for december and the next film in the series 
book purists will never like any movie adaptations of their favorite reads im not a book purist but i do read quite a bit that being said i love this movie for what it is entertainment based upon a literary classic i like the first edition of this movie saw it several times in the theatre this version is even better briefly spoilers backstory is expanded with more background on thorins ascension as the dwarves leader the time in hobbiton is expanded and justly so while not quite as good as the scenes in fotr it does recapture the essence of hobbit life even a young bilbo and gandalf face not seen the arrival of the is expanded as well i love the interaction between them as i watched these scenes i could not help but feel there was some message to it as in screw you pompous book purists and elitist middle classers just have fun and dont take everything so seriously very happy to have the in almost book form more time in rivendell the great goblin song and dance is back the rest of the movie had bits and pieces of extra footage but not much to decsribe in any length here to digress again this movie is about entertainment sure there are issues i have with it but it does not change the fact that this is entertainment at its finest visually stunning great actors as well as the excellent story that is it based upon i can only look forward to the next movie book aside hang up the negativity theres too much of it in this world take a breath and enjoy life 
i havent watched the special features yet but the extended edition is the version of this movie to watch the extra bits range from incredibly important plot enhancers to just fun additions i was a little hesitant at first because i honestly thought it was a bit too long in theaters but i will now be selling my theatrical version minor spoilers there was one extended bit that was embarrassing to watch kind of like how phantom menace is awesome but the jar jar parts are embarrassing to watch especially if someone comes in on that part and you basically have to defend yourself for liking some serious cheese i digress the troll king guy sings and while being very tolkieny it is uncomfortable to watch kind of like if your grandma put her hand way too high on your leg and just left it there for far too long also as far as extended content goes there is more violence notably a few more decapitations and the fleeting nudity mentioned on the back of the box its there look at the back cover youll see it was just the dwarves playing in a fountain from a distance it was funny and harmless but something to keep in mind if you dont want younger viewers to see cg dwarf butt 
loved the lord of rings and so glad they did the hobbit cant wait for next one good actors great cinematography gorgeous location attention to detail special effects action fun lines go it all 
this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie as follows movie video audio great blu ray disc all around i know that i will be viewing this moviemany more times highly recommended for your collection cant wait for the other parts of the hobbit to be completed 
i didnt want the movie to end loved the movie and i can hardly wait for the sequel to follow 
this is up there like the lotr i like how he added what gandelf was doing in the book he just leaves then pops back but he ties in other books that are not lotr nicely 
i was thrilled and a bit nervous to see the hobbit an unexpected journey would the movie follow the book would it be entertaining and worthwhile while staying true to what tolkien created for me the answer to all these questions was yes while the order of events was altered somewhat and many new scenes were added to turn the hobbit into a trilogy the changes only made characters deeper the plot more exciting and the story more full plenty of action laughs and stunning scope make this movie a winner more importantly it keeps the tolkien spirit alive and is very inspiring for fans of the book and others who have never read it the hobbit will be entertainment at its best 
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen the actors are are simply wonderful and captivating each is unique in their character and so likeable it is a masterpiece in visuals and the story even if your not familiar with the books draws you in effortlessly i very much enjoy lord of the rings trilogy however i can honestly say the hobbit an unexpected journey has taken a higher rank than any of the lotr trilogy i believe this is suitable for a wide variety of audiences with parental guidance as rated this magnificent movie is sure to be a liftime favorite for many this disc edition is excellent and the making of video blogs and journey of all those involved making these hobbit movies is also wonderful to watch very informative and allows you to view some of the actors in their true forms the heart and spirit of all those involved making this movie really shine through i purchased this on amazon and i will also purchase the extended version being released in december this has become my absolute favorite movie a sincere thank you to all those involved in making this you all did a magnificent and outstanding job 
i really enjoyed seeing this at home in bluray i dont have a player computer that will support d the extended edition has lots of additional material making the movie hours minutes im looking forward to the next of the trilogy 
this is a really great film i have the trilogy and love this am looking forward to the rest of this trilogy 
if you liked the lord of the rings the hobbit is the beginning of the tale of the one ring being found if you arent familiar with the lord of the rings the hobbit is a wonderful adventure with dragons included i highly recommend the movie 
get a hot cup of tea and a good hearty snack sit in your most comfy chair with a soft blanket and settle into this most beautifully rendered movie of middle earth youll feel right at home in the hobbits cozy welcoming home under the hill the men who gather there for adventure eat and laugh and sing their deep low song of mournful history so you want to just jump in and join them it is so exciting and good for the heart to see baggit spelling the dear peaceful happy to be bored hobbit embrace courage and go the extra mile as he grows to show such bravery and consistant devotion to the king in the group he is not trying to be a hero but falls into that position over and over and rises to the occasion the filming is extraordinary and gruesome and just awe inspiring youll be so happy you have it in your library if you get it wow connie
wonderful movie the plot keeps you in suspense the hobbit is definitely a great addition to lord of the rings 
 the hobbit an unexpected journey is a unique film that appears to obviously stir the concept of benevolent forces colliding with malevolent elements ian mckellen returns in the pivotal role of gandalf the grey he persuasively plays the wizard who strives to foster unity among bilbo baggins and the company of dwarves cate blanchett elizabeth ponyo hanna and hugo weaving the matrix films captain america cloud atlas also play important roles with the characters of galadriel and elrond the artistic detail of the orcs and goblins are done in a one of a kind fashion but i admit that they also remind me a little of some of the villain characters from my husbands world of warcraft computer game many of the characters played an integral part to the plot of this film however two of my personal favorite characters were that of bilbo baggins played by martin freeman and thorin oakenshield played by richard armitage they both seem to be two sides of the same spiritual coin and challenge each other in way that brings out their spiritual growth the hobbit an unexpected journey is great for those who enjoyed any of the lord rings trilogies or like fantasy movies 
the hobbit has got to be even better than lord of the rings the way the movie is woven into the later is seamless 
the lotr series set the template for this film it incorporates many of the same characters sets and sound track lotr was arguably the best film s ever made no one expected this from peter jackson whose films before and since have left little to rave about there were scenes where i felt jackson was resting on his laurels not wanting to do a second take while there were other scenes which left me breathless in case you didnt realize it this is a prequel to lotr in this story a younger bilbo martin freeman joins gandalf ian mckellen and the slobbish dwarves regain their mountain taken by a dragon in this episode bilbo acquires his sword sting and the ring they do not reach the mountain gandalf appears to be our only source for truisms and memorable lines your house is now behind you the world is ahead or evil will always look for a foothold in the world or true courage is not knowing when to take a life but when to spare one this written with wwii in the mind of tolkien i couldnt help but think of the dragon as germany or of the elves appeasement philosophy that the world was at peace while battles raged on the only real question is to watch it in d imax or the regular screen as a fan i thought the headache from the d imax was worth every penny however there were only a few scenes where i thought the d really made it you wont be too cheated watching it in d martin freeman has a very strong british accent unlike the other hobbits initially i thought his character was a weak link similar to elijah wood as frodo he grew stronger in his role as the film progressed although i am not convinced he was the best choice sylvester mccoy plays radagast the brown he is a wizard peter jackson cut out of the original screenplay for the fellowship of the rings the year old christopher lee returns to his role as does cate blanchett ian holm elijah wood andy serkis and hugo weaving a worthy effort 
this is what happens when a classic work of fiction gets the attention to detail it deserves in a movie because it is filled with lore from middle earth enough to satisfy even a tolkien nerd like myself thankfully jackson didnt follow the typical hollywood paradigm of taking it to a whole new level with a sequel technically a prequel in this case because the story is smaller in scale than lotr and should be that way from an unexpected party with the stirring song about the dwarven homeland bilbos reluctance and sense of loss as he rushes out of his comfortable home without even a handkerchief the terrifying episode of roast mutton as bilbo begins to prove his worth against the trolls to the titanic battle in the mountains followed by a short rest and the arrival at the last homely house all building up to riddles in the dark with the danger and creepiness of gollums cave coupled with the daring escape and finally the breathtaking cliffhanger of out of the frying pan into the fire and a logical ending to part one its difficult to go wrong when youve got a cast starring ian mckellenmacbeth mckellen dench thames shakespeare collection returning as gandalf the wandering wizard supplemented with an excellent performance by martin freemansherlock season oneas bilbo baggins as well as richard armitagerobin hood season oneplaying thorin oakenshield not to mention sylvester mccoy as radaghast the brown cate blanchett as galadriel christopher lee ian holm and on and on yes the acting is superb and as with the lotr series every character is cast to perfection truly bringing each character to life and i really have to say that nobody can do dwarves and elves like jackson its as if hes found some secret notes from tolkien that gives him special insight i was slightly disappointed that all the orcs are now cgi and the flight from the goblin king did approach being over the top at times but these are very minor complaints given how amazing this film is overall apparently based on some negative reviews ive read peter jackson is unable to live up to some peoples expectations of absolute perfection but for those of us lifelong fans of tolkien lovers of great cinema or anyone that enjoys being swept away by fantasy there is the hobbit an unexpected journey o update tysm amazon for releasing this on instant video so ridiculously close to the end of its theatrical run lol i think ive already watched it a couple times since i bought it i honestly think i like this movie better than lotr blasphemy ikr the included making of docs are so enjoyable and made me realize just how much of a labor of love this film was to jackson and the entire cast crew 
i absolutely love these moves and cant wait until part two comes out for the price and length of the movie it is well worth the money spent 
this was a great movie in the theaters it was especially good in the high frame rate version i hope all the others are going to have a hfr version its the best way to see this 
my biggest disappointment when i purchased this for instant viewing was i thought the movie was actually long i purposely made a point to not catch any previews or see any trailers im honestly not to unhappy i am a true old fan of the books having first read them in the early s the fellowship et al was beautiful to see however the story was imo butchered beyond belief i am truly a vicious critic and while i could watch the movies i still cringe at some of the directors choices to be honest he did much the same with the hobbit yet this time around it did not matter so much im not here to rant or rave about fps or all the other silliness hey im watching on a tv not hd at my comp the movie was very entertaining killed almost hours very nicely after work and left me waiting for the second real bucks was well worth the investment and ill watch at least once more with a fairly newbie mindset if you want or demand the big screen effect well there are still theaters to go to i however enjoyed this very much it isnt the book verbatim but honestly the hobbit or lotr is realistically way beyond the capacity or ability to do as written enjoy and if you never have before afterwards treat yourself to the real treasure the books 
when peter jackson adapted the lord of the rings trilogy from j r r tolkien onto the big screen it became one of the most epic film series of all time full of drama action adventure and fantasy now the hobbit is back on the big screen once again from jackson and manages to fully recapture that old magic for a basic plot summary the hobbit is the tale of bilbo baggins martin freeman who is unexpectedly called upon by gandalf the wizard ian mckellen to participate in a grand adventure to help a group of dwarves regain their long lost treasure along the way the group encounters such creatures as trolls orcs goblins and even a sad slimy little creature who seems to have multiple personalities and is in possession of a very powerful item though many reviews of this movie were quite negative calling it overblown strange or even outright boring it had the complete opposite effect on me as a huge fan of lotr i felt as if i had been transported back into that fantasy universe once again and i loved every minute of it though the decision to break the one tolkien book into three movies is controversial from a number of different viewpoints from ticket sales to subject matter i can now say that it will at the very least be fun to have two more theater experiences inside that lotr realm perhaps the most interesting part of the hobbit experience however is the fact that its role in the overall scheme of things in comparison to the book is actually just about as opposite as it could be the hobbit book was written as a tale for his children and thus had a very lighthearted tone when it was eventually published and achieved great success tolkien then decided to write the much more serious lotr however seeing as how the lotr series was put on the big screen first it was a challenge to the filmmakers to get the tone right stay true to the tone of the book sometimes goofy and the lotr geeks will cry foul be too serious and the book enthusiasts will discount you overall i felt as if jackson did a solid job of walking that fine line as this one does have more fun moments than any of the lotr pictures overall i really have nothing bad to say about the hobbit i have enjoyed the story since i was a child so to see it done right on the big screen is a treat beyond imagination to me it was neither boring nor stale but rather exciting and intense though strange that the journey will not be complete for nearly two years i will thoroughly enjoy the next two films if they are anything like the quality of this one 
this movie was eagerly anticpated by me and did not disappoint a great sci fi prequel laying the foundation for the alien series the only thing it lacked was sigourney fighting the devils spawn dont you just hate it when people youve grown to love get old the bluray was great 
i have been a fan of the alien franchise since i first saw alien i have been a fan of ridley scott since then as well my expectations were obviously very high for this movie and for me it exceeded those expectations first those expecting an alien movie were forewarned by ridley himself that this was not going there and that the story was focused on telling that of the space jockey and his race that is what i expected and that is what we got the elements of alien that give a nod to the xenomorph was just fine for me in explaining where they evolved from and what they were engineered for which has been obvious and foretold in prior alien movies which was to be used as a weapon starting out as a killer bacteria and just like any bacteria they eventually grew from their first incarnation but honestly who cares about that this movie explores a much deeper element of that universe which i feel is way more thought provoking where do we come from who are the creators i do not want to give away to much because i want to keep this spoiler free all i can say is i love where ridley scott took this movie and i hope that he follows through with two more sequels to continue this story line i am fine with where the xenomorph story was left and personally feel it is time to move past that and move towards this story line those who have seen the movie and get it will understand what i am talking about those who were expecting a return to xenomorph alien sci fi should either pass on this movie or just set themselves up right now that this movie does not go in that direction and only a fraction of it explains their entry into the universe painting a much bigger story line that is way bigger then the xenomorph to begin with bravo ridley scott 
ridley scotts triumphant return to the science fiction genre may have started off as a prequel to his classic alien but prometheus is a very different type of picture a suspenseful and captivating film with provocative concepts and thematic material that challenges the viewer as much as it satisfies on a rich aesthetic level its alien aspects and there are some are secondary to a story that asks where the human race came from how we got here and where were going jon spaihts and damon lindelofs screenplay posits these eternal questions in a manner thats positively refreshing in our current age of soulless blockbusters opening with an utterly beautiful prologue set on earth at the dawn of time shot in iceland by scott and proceeding to follow a spaceship crew in the late st century setting out to uncover the answers among the crew of the ship prometheus are scientists noomi rapace and logan marshall green gruff captain idris elba icy cold weyland corporation exec charlize theron and a curious android named david michael fassbender the work of the elderly charles weyland guy pearce himself who funded the mission to track down the whereabouts of beings who left calling cards on ancient cave paintings around the globe upon arriving on a desolate planet rapace and company find a dank deserted chamber with remnants of an alien race that fled the scene some time before as well as a gooey chemical substance thats anything but benevolent its easy to see why some viewers expecting a straight ahead alien prequel may be turned off by prometheus this film isnt just a variation on its predecessor with a group of disparate characters running around in the dark from a monster its brilliance is due to scotts blending of familiar genre conventions with a story line thats deeper and more involved than most viewers may be prepared for granted there are times when you wish certain plot points were clarified more than they are especially in a mid section that seems a bit rushed but whats left unanswered arent so much flaws as they are concepts left intentionally dangling for viewers to further contemplate it may be less accessible to the masses than alien but its also emotionally stronger and deeper in terms of what its attempting to do and say rapaces sensitive performance resonates strongly here in the latter regard giving her character an emotional vulnerability thats wholly sympathetic not just a ripley clone her elizabeth shaw is the moral epicenter of a crew that watches as their lofty hopes of finding out where life came from turns into a nightmarish assortment of questions about why the would be gods are trying to destroy them shaws unshakeable faith is intriguingly tested by both the circumstance the crew finds themselves in as well as her unusual relationship with the mysterious david whose motivations are never entirely made clear in an otherwise fine performance from fassbender scotts penchant for amazing visuals are of course on hand throughout the film and there are a handful of dynamic set pieces a thrilling storm that threatens the crew is later followed by a harrowing medical sequence and a sensational finale with a truly miraculous sense of scale the director said in pre publicity that he wanted prometheus to be big and the film is indeed that both in the messages it develops and the visuals on screen spectacular effects and haunting creatures include concepts that resemble the work of h r giger giving fans a taste of the universe that scott first brought to the screen with alien but here in a very different context in fact if theres a moment that feels somewhat out of step here its in a quote from jerry goldsmiths unused main title from alien that comes across as unnecessarily shoe horned into the picture dariusz wolskis cinematography and even the score credited to marc streitenfeld but enhanced with a lovely theme by harry gregson williams thats used throughout the picture so much that its surprising he only received an additional music credit are likewise effective this is a film thats filled with so much artistic invention and memorable images that one can see sci fi fans returning to prometheus for some time to come both to dissect its narrative as well as take in its amazing artistic design throughout his career ridley scott has shown himself to be a master craftsman in terms of imagery not just in his classics like alien and blade runner but also in the commercial failures of legend and white squall throughout them all scott has brought the beauty of nature and indeed different worlds and even whole universes to life very much like an artist painting on a blank canvas while not without its flaws prometheus ranks not only with those films visually but has one of the most compelling story lines from any of scotts works as well as an emotional range thats particularly surprising at its conclusion its a movie that stays with you long after the credits have rolled a film that entertains and engages a sublime mix so rarely seen at the movies any more 
saw it imax d the way it was meant to be seen cant wait to own it the d was so effective that i found myself trying to look around objects and actors to see behind them in scenes i love michael fassbender and he is absolutely perfect as the android david i believed he was david he really made the movie for me noomi rapaces performance was memorable and her gory scene was seriously disturbing in just the right way i wrapped my arms around myself and curled up as if i was feeling her pain charlize theron was good but not great idris elba and all the remaining cast delivered outstanding cinematography so much beauty to behold in every expansive landscape made me wish my eyes were bigger there was so much to take in visually the music was perfectly scored swelling at peak moments causing my body and mind to involuntarily react and swell with intensity in the same way the story was engaging and moved at a good pace i was on the edge of my seat the whole time so much more to mention but simply put amazing 
having lived in barrow alaska for over years i was especially struck by the arctic like background in this film the harsh tone of a distant arctic land actually iceland can grab the viewer i went back to the movie theater twice after the first viewing and still marveled at the cold and dangerous place director ridley scott once again showed his touch for the artistic and stunning he also did the original film and then no more like some other reviewers i long felt that alien was one of the best all time science fiction movies right there with and in some ways much better scott said he wanted to go back and find out more about that giant pilot with an exploded chest in a crashed ship on a distant moon where was that alien from and on what kind of mission to make up for lost time scott loads prometheus with lots of high tech plot and characters the ship now has a crew of but you will still find the evil corporation reps there along with a very determined ripley type played by noomi rapace of the girl with the dragon tatoo she really carries on the ripley determination and dont forget the robot here identified right from the start but which side is he on there is a new dimension to the alien story which where prehistoric cave paintings seem to point toward that distant moon and our ancestors or creators lots of excitement and very scary moments you might wonder whether the certain sequel to this prequel will develop the distant ancestors as the prime feature such questions can lead to many ideas while you are out on a summer night with your telescope or naked eye just looking at the stars and wondering earl
you can see the beginning of alien in this movie it is beautiful to watch and very very bizarre i enjoyed the film if you like alien you will enjoy this 
ive been waiting for this one so good im a big fan of the alien saga and i am very pleased with the way prometheus turned out ive had friends of mine say that they were disappointed with the lack of fright that the alien series gave us and i agree that it wasnt scary but ridley scott took questions of evolution versus creation to a whole new level at least on the big screen all star cast sweet action and special effects that put the old alien movies to shame prometheus is not for everyone but i cant wait to watch it few hundred more times 
love prometheus great cast awesome sets location i think its even better then alien and the alien movies are hard to beat thank you amazon 
others have reviewed the disk release of prometheus and have done so more thoroughly than i could prometheus is a superb film that integrates very well with the alien films it held my attention throughout and left me wanting more it is not an action film but that should not be taken as a criticism prometheus blu ray d blu ray dvd digital copy 
i went into this film with no expectations at all a free and clear mind and i can truly say thank you ridley scott having read quite a few reviews here ive noticed many lackluster or negative reviews well to each his own its been some years that ive gone to a film that has truly blown my mind most of science fiction today is so poor and embarrasing that it hurts to watch this is the return of true sci fi genius and done by a master of the genre some people are saying they didnt explain that or i dont get it or that doesnt make sense well not all films explain everything and to me thats a good thing i was glued to my seat the whole time and my palms were so sweaty i dropped my pop im not going to go into a massive rant about the effects or the plot or the macabre sets theres plenty of those reviews here thumbs up to michael fassbender whos performance as the android david was extrordinary so my point is basically do what other reviews have said dont expect oscars and go into this with a clear head and forget about alien even though youll want to watch alien as soon as you get home from the theatre i want to give this stars but i have to go with my gut and give it and a half stars still a remarkable accomplishment this is truly unbelievable filmaking and this is what sci fi is all about take it for what it is a spetacular ride from start to finish and thanks again ridley for a truly remarkable film cannot wait for blade runner and of course prometheus 
the storyline ploty is really great goes along with the discussion around creationists and darwinists as well as conspiracy theorists around alien invasions besides that any movie with charlize theron is worth watching so we have a good story goddess actress in a supporting role and excellent special effects and execution of the movie this gotta be a new standard in science fictions would rate that same or higher than gravity not sure why prometheus has not gotten as much attention 
whats it about a team of scientists arrive on an alien planet to uncover the origins of humans and the earth but what awaits them is something deadly is it any good prequels have been the flavour of the last decade as an easy way to extend the life cycle of a particular franchise some of them decent but mostly bad so leave it to sir ridley scott to create a smart science fiction film that sets the film in the alien world but doesnt rely on it as a cheap way to market the film naoomi rappose from girl with the dragon tattoo is a breath of fresh air with her excellent performance as the crew leader shaw but it is david the robot played by michael fassberer which deliveres the performance that most people will be talking about simply amazing for me what makes this film so great is the perfect balance between the amazing action and exploration allowing audiences to fully immerse themselves in the world the controversy surrounding the film in regards to being confusing is quite ridiculous so if you do get the chance make sure to see the film in imax d for an out of this world experience best bit giving birth to a human child is the most wonderful and joyous occasions that could happen an alien child not so much a horrifically cringe worthy scene to say the least did you know the androids names in the alien films follow an alphabetical pattern in alien its ash in aliens and alien its bishop in alien resurrection its call and in this film its david 
i think some people who are true sci fi fans and either didnt like this movie initially or were confused on how to feel about it should watch it again i watched this the first nite it came out in theatres and everyone was super quiet after the movie ended i think everyone was processing this movie doesnt use the typical sci fi tactics to engage the audience there isnt really a constant feed of mind numbing visual action one would assume this movie was done tastefully for the most part and speaking of good taste wow there is a really freaking hot guy in this logan marshall green is so friggin hawwwwwwt he made me smile just watching him but prepare thyself because there is a price to pay for those good looks of his i will not spoil anything but if youre squirmish get ready initially it was hard for me to accept noomi as the female protagonist for a few reasons ill just come out and say it there is something off putting about her facial structure and hair for me her bone structure is maybe just bad on film i wanted to slick her hair back the whole movie because it was always in her face not to mention her accent in this in the end she won me over with her perseverance for answers despite the obstacles and her ability to survive i cant say im sold on the idea that she would have pushed through all she did due to how her character was presented but i accepted it and kept my eye on the idea her character brought up which is you may not like what answers you find that reside beyond your faith but the truth is freeing she really is a pretty good actress so eventually my shallow reasons for not liking her fell by the wayside i love the guy who plays the captain of the prometheus idris elba he has a few cheesy lines but i think he was good for the role and ya gotta have the black guy charlize theron is as usual wonderful to watch fassbender was pretty good but i never got why he was such a vindictive android plus i had just recently seen him in shame and the transition from a sex crazed sad guy to android was a little cough hard to shake guy pearce was okay at best being a gross old rich man i wish they would have just used an old man though older actors need roles and this would have fit the bill for the right old man and i really wish they would have better visualized the ship itself since the movie was even named after it i never got a good sense of the layout one of the things i didnt like about this movie spoiler alert the aliens in the movie are well done i got so frustrated when the alien doesnt answer dr shaw in some way after she pleads for answers and pours her heart out in his facial expression the alien seems moved by her briefly but then the android steps in and just pisses him off youd think mr weyland would have a better plan for first contact than to use an android as ambassador asking for sh t that is not how you get what you want no less from an hr giger represented alien species despite the stereotypical plot twists and tactics i really enjoyed this film i wish there were more sci fi movies in general and ive always been a fan of aliens and im not too big on scary stuffz dont expect perfection from it despite my star rating compared to all the thoughtless garbage hollywood makes these days this is a gem you might just need to give it a second or third chance to let it charm you 
after having watched all of the aliens movies numerous times this movie does a fantastic job of both explaining there they came from without giving away too much 
those who are familiar with the names ridley scott h r giger alien got a slow trickling of information about the movie release of prometheus its story plot and origin were a complete mystery and should remain that way until you view it the mystery surrounding the movie is as intense mysterious and teasing as the trailer included with this review in fact the trailer is a fair depiction of what you will get with the film you will get great science fiction intense gut wrenching scenes and mysterious cave drawings that lead scientists to another world dont talk to many people who have already seen prometheus before going you dont want to know if you enjoy great science fiction and you enjoyed the alien series of movies just go prometheus is beautiful and horrifying at the same time it isnt for the squeamish i will be ultra careful not to tell too much as well those familiar with the alien series are also familiar with the name weyland industries they are the corporation behind the original alien movies they are the money and brains behind the operation to explore alien life forms so when elizabeth shaw played by noomi rapace who rose to fame with the swedish the girl with the dragon tattoo movies finds cave drawings all over earth that are similar it leads her and her boyfriend charlie holloway to question our origins who are we and where did we come from prometheus is more thought provoking than action movie not to say that the action isnt plentiful but the thought and development that went into the film are top notch as well as the acting direction and cinematography there really isnt much to criticize about the film prometheus is pure and simple great escapism cinema you will be gone away for two hours to a place that will have you thinking wondering and cringing there have been a great variety of summer movies this year and hollywood has finally learned a valuable lesson about moviegoers we want variety prometheus is possibly one of the best science fiction movies of all time emphasis on the science it mixes the alien genre with a great movie like a space odyssey it does what every great movie should do make you question and make you think go before you hear anything more about it 
when we ask someone you wanna meet your maker were basically asking them if they want to die you hear that phrase a lot in action movies take that phrase and let us consider its meaning in a literal sense do you want to meet your maker most people would answer a definite yes and that is the underlying theme of this ambitious thought provoking movie throughout the eons man has been longing to meet his maker various belief systems have arisen to address this very desperate longing but what would happen if technology has advanced to the point where this desire of the human heart can now be fulfilled this movie was inspired by the works of the swiss author erich von daniken he was the one who had originally proposed the idea that an advanced race of space travelers have visited earth in the distant past and not only that these ancient visitors have had an impact on the development of civilization technology and perhaps even the human species itself the works of zacharia sitchin have also had a clear influence on the themes of the movie sitchins works have claimed that a group of advanced humanoids called the anunaki have influenced ancient humans and their ways of life the premise of the movie is that a pair of researchers uncovered ancient clues that space travelers may have visited earth in the past cave paintings and drawings from diverse geographical locations and different time periods all indicated the same symbol the symbol is a unique star formation a star map within the drawings there is always a figure of a tall humanoid pointing to the stars the researchers concluded that this meant an invitation from the star people to mankind with the help of weyland industries the researchers embark on a long journey to the distant star system shown on the star map after a two year journey onboard prometheus the ship the research team is woken up from their deep sleep and arrives at the destination among the crew is an android david david is an advanced synthetic humanoid created by the ceo of weyland industries the prometheus descends on the planet entering its atmosphere analysis showed that the atmosphere will not support humans donning on their protective gear the crew sets off to investigate a mysterious structure on the planets surface the structure seems to have been artificial not natural upon entering the structure they discover the remnants of what appears to be an alien scientific base camp further exploration took the crew to a temple like room littered with metallic cylinders an unknown black substance is oozing out of some of the cylinders david with his superior intellect discovers a recorded hologram of events that took place on the facility more than two thousand years ago meanwhile drs shaw and ford decides to bag a preserved alien head in order to take it back to the prometheus for further study i dont want to spoil the plot for you suffice it to say that the ending will be a surprise the reasons for davids mysterious behavior and strange choices will be revealed as the plot unfolds yes the crew will end up finding a living specimen and those acid blooded creatures from alien do make an appearance technically ridley scott has said that this movie is not a direct prequel to alien however it was inspired by that film franchise as well as by the works of the authors mentioned above hr geigers artwork and style also dominate the movie sets as you may know geiger designed the original alien he also designed sil creature in the movie species and clearly the same ferocious creatures in the alien franchise also are present and wreaking havoc in this film the special effects are what you would expect of a high budget ridley scott movie everything about this movie is top notch and that includes the nearly all star cast this is the best science fiction movie that i have seen in a long time if you are looking for movie in this genre that offers more than action thrills and special effects then this is it and you will be pleased to know that unlike some of those other cerebral sci fi movies that start off slow this one actually gets off to a fairly fast start oh and great performances from noomi rapace michael fassbender guy pierce and charlize theron 
you cant judge prometheus by watching it just once its not that kind of movie there are too many nuances i love ridley scott my blade runner guy and hope hell follow prometheus up with another quasi prequel to the alien franchise even if youre not a fan of prometheus you must at least recognize the visual beauty of the scene in which michael fassbenders david expresses childlike joy when he holds earth in his hands gorgeous scene 
i must warn you all this is a movie for only the original alien fans this film is amazing in ways story special effects musical score acting and visually this is a truly is the sci fi film of the year but spoiler alert the original alien is not present but the other creatures make up for it i only recommend this to ridley scotts alien fans forget the other films because this one kicks them in the balls 
i cant stress that this movie is the introduction to how the aliens were made so if your expecting the alien queen to rip out of someones chest then yea your going to be disappointed almost every negative review i have read was about how they expected to see the aliens from the original in it and lots of death and murder and blood this movie had a ton of graphical love and science fiction that made me want to learn more and toward the end your like oh thats how space jockey ended up the way he did and how the aliens were brought up you can pick this movie apart but if you just watch it for enjoyment and artistic value you should love it i watched this movie in imax d and holy cow blown away 
please dont take advice from people that most likely have not seen alien there is going to be a part two i recommend this movie for all the true real alien fans not the ones that watch alien vs predator idiots the real and i mean real alien movies 
this is a great prequel to the alien series maybe the next movie if any they will show where she went i would recommend for all you alien sci fi fans out there 
this movie has been getting ripped apart by people with their hopes just way too high i feel this is a prequel film to the alien series yes but come on people your just being way too judgmental anyway thats what i wanted to say off the bat this movie is fantastic great cast very good storyline yes its not perfect but and it has its plot holes but it fits the alien theme well and has great potential to relaunch the series which was kinda faltering on its own anyway any real sci fi fan should check this movie out its worth it 
great back story to the alien saga breath taking visuals and fantastic acting looking forward to seeing where this story leads 
 prometheus in this eerie prequel to the aliens franchise director ridley scott shows himself firmly in command a skillful dynamic auteur with a capacity to evoke wonder and inspire awe although tied to the alien films prometheus is creepy and suspenseful but doesnt dwell in the high octane gore of the original films its there but its not the whole point of the film instead big concepts about the conquest of space cosmic seeding and the spiritual yearnings of aliens androids and man are probed and examined and many big questions are left dangling tantalizingly in need of further exploration i cant remember a recent movie ive wanted a sequel of more than this one im itching to see what happens next in addition to the direction and special effects the acting is also pretty good i did not care much for the pair of lead actors noomi rapace and logan marshall green the scientists behind the expedition although charlize theron is fine as their unlikable corporate minder and idris alba is fun as the noble spaceship captain with major props to the supporting actors who played his crew the breakaway star of this show though is the steely eyed michael fassbender who plays david the films obligatory android who is a spine tingling combination of s hal and star treks data one of the best portrayals of an ai being youll ever see truly delicious the aliens look cool too bravo for ridley scott who is back in the saddle again hopefully the studios will be smart and keep him at the helm for the planned sequels cant wait until theyre out dj joe sixpack slipcue film reviews 
ive been waiting for this film since i read about it a couple of years ago ridley scott damon lindelof noomi rapace link to the alien franchise im there when does it open saw it in imax d and thats the way it was meant to be seen a great use of that median especially fassbenders scene with the interstellar map you feel like you are in the room it is a spectacular gorgeous film the fly by over iceland in the beginning is remarkable and the action horror scenes have an added impact due to the sight and sound technology kudos to scott for using all of it lindelofs script revisits a lost theme science versus and faith rapaces shaw is at the center a scientist who believes in a god and wants to find the creator where did we come from is her big question rapace is surrounded with a great cast including fassbender who delivers his part excellently theron elba pearce and even kate dickie crazy lysa arryns from game of thrones its ridleys ride and he takes you from feeling whistful and optimistic to being horrified and scared in the space of hours it does have all of the elements of the original alien space jockey face hugger chest burster robot evil corporation its all there noomi rapace as lizbeth shaw fulfills every expectation i had of her she is the motor to the movie the one to watch ive read where some folks dont like the film because it doesnt answer any questions i wouldnt see this movie in that light since when do we ever get the answers we want with anything lindelof writes it is a great sci fi film and you should see it if you are a fan of the genre and especially if you love the alien franchise see it on the big screen then buy the blu ray sit back enjoy i was years old when i saw the first alien movie in the theater i remember how it made me feel to this day scared horrified anxious suspenseful and finally thrilled when the hero turned out to be a woman it was the first vhs tape i bought it was the first dvds box set i bought i even named my dog ripley i love this franchise and prometheus is a fine addition edit i was so fascinated by this movie in imax d i went and saw it again knowing that i would probably never have that chance again i spent the week in between reading reviews and interviews about the film i enjoyed it as much the second time and believe that this is one helluva sci fi film id say its scotts best film in years prometheus manages to find a balance as a beautiful thoughtful clever film with some very visceral horror thrown in the action snaps along at brisk pace the music score is great and there are some interesting techniques used to move the story along that ive never seen before i eagerly wait for this blu ray dvd to be released id love to see the directors cut 
sc fi fans are the biggest whiners of them all just like those who trashed tngs insurrection and nemesis the prometheus whiners are ccomplaining because all of their expectations havent been met to be honest prometheus is certainly not at the same level as forbidden planet but its not that bad the visuals were incredible on blu ray and the sound was amazing sometimes people expect too much from a film and then they end up not getting what thry are looking for one should view a film by letting it tell the story instead of trying to bend it to fit your needs when you do that you just end up hating it this film was pretty cool you just need to open your mind a little and let the film serve its purpose otherwise you will never see what the rest of us see 
it is rare these days for a movie to both entertain and make one think not only were the visuals stunning the plot was interesting even if it was just another take on the ancient astronaut theory and the special effects were remarkable i was expecting another crappy mindless alien movie with nothing but a bunch of predictable mindless beasts lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce i think a lot of nerdy fanboys got butthurt because it didnt turn out to be just that aliens have been done to death brought back as a zombie and then done to death again and then some i find it humorous that fanboys think the alien films were wonderful and without plot holes and inconsistencies the same basement dwelling virgins that have posters of bladerunner on their walls forget that that film was also ripped to shreds by their ilk when it first came out it wasnt until the directors cut came out and a few years had passed that it became a respected sci fi classic fanboys are a lazy lot want only mindless nonstop action and just dont want to think they want everything spoon fed to them on a silver platter with nothing left to the imagination nerd fanboys are ruining chances of more great sci fi movies being made because producers know fanboy losers will hang out in their darkened rooms and pick the movie to shreds frame by frame so they can go online and tear it a part in a vain attempt to sound smart when it just makes them look pathetic and when the day comes that the only movies being made are stupid rom coms and cheesy disney flicks the butt hurt nerds will complain to no end but theyll have no one to blame but themselves that producers wont want to make anymore sci fi flicks i really hope they make a sequel because the engineer universe can be expanded upon whereas the alien universe is dead so if youre a pretentious fanboy dont watch this film watch the alien movies that have already been made because theyre all the same and there is nothing new to add to the alien universe because aliens are just mindless beasts fought by undeveloped characters with big guns that nobody cares about 
i actually only got to see the last ten minutes of this movie in the theatre i was waiting for another movie to start and i took a peek i was mesmerized by how visually stunning it looked i never got a chance to go back to see it so i figured i would just buy it in d when it came out sometimes you know youre going to love a movie before you even see it after some of the negative reviews i was even more fascinated the meaning of life connected to the alien movies wow it upset people because everything wasnt clearly explained i have to get this movie after viewing it i was exhilarated from the experience d at its best there are quite a few movies with d with cheezy in your face gimmicks if they did that with this movie the cheap distraction would cause a huge suspension of belief i drifted right into the screen the depth was enthralling it was like watching imaxs space station and hubble with a great suspenseful story i didnt want it to end i didnt expect it to be a shocker like the other alien movies it had that same intense prolonged suspense that alien had i love ancient aliens and such subject matter so i was fascinated with the idea what if at some point we actually found them what would we learn would they be kind could they help us understand our purpose who made them and so on this alone being the foundation for one of the best sci fi movies ever made time will tell when people stop scratching their heads i wasnt expecting the meaning of life to be revealed what was revealed made sense within the realm of the story itself with video you can go back and you can subtitle things you have trouble hearing and i found certain things could easily be missed with a straight non stop viewing i cant wait to see it again and watch the hour documentary i did watch the deleted scenes and understand why they were cut great job ridley scott i would like to see this the beginning of what should end with aliens im sorry like so many i just didnt like the post aliens movies you can probably pop in alien after this one and find a flow but i know there is more the tech in alien seems older more like prometheus without the touchscreen lets just say that crew got a second rate vessel because it wasnt as highly financed as the first maybe for some reason certain technology plateaus at some point the similiarities of the crafts are very obvious i love this movie and highly recommend it i have a feeling it will age very well and become a classic alien fans will see the saga come full cycle finally i never thought they were just monster movies this movie proves there is nothing cheezy about it the aliens are just a characters in a big story 
i found this to be a wonderful deeply philosophical action movie that leads us to think about our own existence our uniqueness in the universe and our ultimate relevance i think many have a problem because the role of god is left to our speculation but this actually elevates deity beyond human understanding just where it should be the feeling of aloneness this leaves makes us shudder before the here and now our immediate progenitors are spacemen who apparently have scorn for us and want to wipe us out to denude earth of human life strong as they are they are mortal and they can be eaten alive just as humans have been in previous alien films by something they wished to use to wipe out humanity yes humans perform some silly deeds in this film just as humans often do we wouldnt have tragedy if humans always acted perspicaciously the point is that were human and although we can be brilliant we can also be very impulsive and foolish i dont see that the plot shows anything other than human fallibility and a fragility of intellect under the pressure of emotions such as fear lust for power and superiority and sexual abandon finally we are led to ask why we are here why our engineers creators have found us wanting and where do we go from here where are you god we need you the d is glorious the effects stupendous i couldnt have asked for more i saw it with an adult goddaughter who had asked to see it and she couldnt stop saying wow i think that if youve seen this in d you owe it to yourself to see it in d the pq is sharp clear revealing of detail and the audio is perfect we played it on my oppo on a passive system lg with a home theater setup much better than being in the theater dont let the naysayers dissuade you this is a truly fine film which will ultimately rank up there with ridleys best it makes us long to know how we can somehow make ourselves count for more than teardrops in the rain 
this film is about finding ancient art work on tribes who contact with tribes years ago and the people from are future travel in space to the location that was painted on the walls well its a good film lots of action the graphics is awesome a must see film
where do i start do i praise the visual effects and amazingly detailed sets do i call out the haters and point out that the bulk of their complaints were based on the movie not being what they thought itd be what about the epic soundtrack and score the ferocious noomi rapace the synthetic david the fact that the prometheus ship looks like a firefly on steroids there are a few hundred reviews that wrongly wax on plot elements and acting heres the film and the bd review this is an alien movie we are watching the start of it all while the film takes place in the same meta plot it is easy to see the creatures presented being some how related to xenomorphs maybe with a dose or two of cthulhu mentality tentacles a plenty the bd release has some great features by way of deleted scenes some that might have done better to have been kept in the film commentary tracks ridley scott pretty much narrates the film but its not as bad as it sounds he gets really excited about this film and a background featurette that focuses on wayland the visuals are amazing on an up to date bd player and as i said we get the treat of which shook my apartment literally at normal volumes so be mindful of the volume unless you want your photos and whatnots to get shaken off the walls at what you might consider a normal volume its overpowering at points but it sounds great despite the heft of it enjoy this for what it is a long awaited reunion to the alien epic universe were just going to be experiencing some elements that were never covered in the alien franchise where does that leave us where else but in the trusted hands of mr ridley scott it seems this new trilogy is going to answer more than the questions left open by the film prometheus were getting to see some answers that have gone unanswered for over years key word there some ive waited this long the promise of two more films in this series have me waiting hopeful that mr scott can deliver the next movies on the same level that is prometheus beautiful epic eerie and more than a little alien 
the controversy and criticism of prometheus pretty much centers on two things movie fans expected a straight up alien prequel complete with queens face huggers and worker aliens and the film does not have a neatly laid out simplistic plot like the usual fare we see nowadays director ridley scott decided to go his own way not taking the easy and simple route the result is a masterpiece of mystery and questions lost by the critics is scotts examination of human nature and the desire for absolute power and immortality contained within the search for our origins prometheus asks big questions about the creation of life on earth as well as what might be out there in deep space beyond our present technological capabilities human civilization has existed for a mere few thousand years but the universe is billions of years old the foolish belief by many of us today that we somehow have it all figured out is exemplified in the film by the monumental hubris of peter weyland who selfishly set up the expedition to somehow cheat death and to profit by whatever else it found the fact that the engineers in prometheus were able to create magnificent technologies on such a vast scale only amplifies the mysteries of what we dont know the universe is vast beyond our comprehension and the world ridley scott creates in this film with its monsters spacecraft and buildings reinforce his plot device the ending of the film with the robot david and dr shaw leaving lv in the engineer spacecraft tells us in no uncertain terms that there remains a great deal still to be discovered think about it humanity has only begun to scratch the surface of space travel weve only landed a few men on the moon and the sum total of our exploration beyond that is limited to our own solar system which constitutes a tiny portion of the milky way galaxy we humans are like a speck of sand on the shores of a vast ocean but one must remember it was only a few centuries ago that we thought earth was the center of the universe it takes a bit more than transformers or the avengers which is a good movie for its intended audience to touch on the kind of questions scott is tackling here he assumes his audience will consider the questions his film is asking many critics condemned and the original alien for the very same things people are saying now they werent easy to understand they didnt fit into established categories etc prometheus thus fits into something the ancient greek philosopher socrates said years ago i know nothing except the fact of my own ignorance scott asked us to open our minds and see beyond the usual formula stuff it seems some lack the imagination to follow where he leads thats okay im quite willing to go on the journey 
prometheus was the prequel to alien and the alien franchise sorry no ripley in here as it was set years before a team on an undisclosed mission have been sent out to find the possible origins of earth and mankind what they find however is something that should have been left unfound swedish actress noomi rapace is a young scientist and member of the expedition idris elba the wire british detective series luther plays the role of janek the captain of the prometheus and an ex military man fired from his job for dereliction of duty janek is not a member of the scientific team and tells the crew his only function is to fly the ship this movie drags at time and hauls to a point of not quite getting it however all in all its a darn good flick and gives the alien universe some meaning 
other than the seemingly forced appearance by one of cinemas most famous monsters at the end prometheus is very much a film that stands on its own apart from the alien universe sir ridley scott and co i think were very wise in going toward a different direction for the franchise and to focus on the engineers as a result those like myself who is a big fan of the alien movies are introduced to a much richer universe i am intrigued by the character of dr shaw because she not only is a person of science but a person of faith as well and this dichotomy i think is the basis of her journey which is the search for truth to humanitys origins to me i think the true horror in this movie are not the horrible creatures that wreck havoc on the crew of the prometheus but the revelation that the gods or god have forsaken their creations and even worse intend to destroy what they made what if you found out that you were a mistake dr shaws discovery does not make her want to run back to earth but instead drives her to find the source of the engineers thus her journey continues for answers and sets us up for a sequel which i certainly hope happens this is another winner from ridley scott the cinematography is awe inspiring the art direction is superb the effects enhance the music by marc streitenfeld is channeling vangelis composer of scotts bladerunner and the most thrilling scene of the movie is dr shaws self surgery to remove an unwanted embryo from her body definitely a keeper michael fassbender treats us to another great performance as the artificial man david who himself was engineered by humanity which introduces us to another potential dichotomy that can be explored in the sequel he is definitely more interesting than most of the human crew you can call him a hal with legs as a film prometheus truly stands apart from the rest of the alien films in fact the presence of the alien or xenomorph in the film is almost questionable if you remove that then the only thing that ties this movie to alien are the engineers so what we have here is really a spinoff which makes it all the more interesting for fans of the alien universe highly recommended 
alien must have a lot of pretty hardcore fans because i saw little reason to hate this movie i enjoyed it quite a few fans had an issue with the engineer ship scene its quite clear that there was exploding debris all over the ship forcing them to stay on that path watch the scene again it makes perfect sense this is a fine example of overeducated overgrown children who think theyre smarter than everyone else especially the people that made this film its a shame because i thought the movie was extremely well done and deserving of a sequel thanks to the ridiculous complaints this probably will never happen just dumb the next film down and make it pg fox clearly your target demographic is too ungrateful to deserve great r rated sci fi 
i saw the two original alien movies when i was young enough that they would forge my lifelong love of movies these films transcended the science fiction i was used to seeing and offered a grown up more cynical and dangerous version of star wars star trek and the like so i was one of the first in line to get tickets to prometheus which i hoped would reboot the franchise and erase the memory of the later inferior alien films overall there are moments of supreme cinematic greatness combined with a few gaffs of bad science and plot logic but largely its a fusion of some of ridley scotts most brilliant themes potential spoilers ahead first the weaker parts scientists discover a drawing of dots in a cave in scotland which theyve seen in other caves throughout history they take the massive leap of logic to presume that not only did these come from aliens as a map but these same aliens were the creators of humans these scientists use this flimsy thesis to convince a death obsessed rich guy to funnel one trillion dollars into developing the technology to reach the dots the really bad science doesnt end there once we reach the alien cave they continue to make one bad decision after another despite some very scary things happening this is where it lurches more into the teen horror flick genre where characters disband poke around the dark and inevitably meet their alien oriented grisly endings there are also some weaker moments of dialog that seem like a tack on from test audience screenings not understanding whats happening one has shaw discussing her infertility with her partner in a conversational segway thats really off later charlize theron reveals her true relationship with weyland which is a little tired im probably being a little harsh because i expect so much from this film but on the plus side this is an excellent movie in any regular context but also a welcome addition to the alien universe there is so much overlap from alien and aliens that there is a sense of having seen much of it all before but large parts of the idea do stand on their own there are some truly great horror moments that are simultaneously gripping revolting disturbing and original and its these handful of scenes that stand out after watching the whole thing the visuals have never been better featuring an alien landscape thats seductive fluid and organic supported by the invisible use of first class cgi and it looks even better in d whereas alien pulled back from the full sexuality of h r gigers designs this film doesnt pull punches in the creature designs and attacks of the face huggers the design of the engineers the creative use of holograms and look of the ship are all extremely well conceived this is also an exceptional cast noomi rapace reminded me of how great sigourney weaver was and delivers ferociously in this role similarly michael fassbender crafts a delicate performance as the ships android treading the line between its appreciation of the beauty of lifes designs and the psychotic nature of something that can think but not feel his character is essential in connecting the themes of death being a part of life and the desire to meet and sometimes destroy your creator this is all wrapped in a very very complicated backstory about how the engineers spread life around the universe like space travelling gardeners there are mythical connections to prometheus wiki it to see and some not too subtle religious parallels shaw is a barren woman made pregnant by god there are strong themes of selfishness and self sacrifice natural death and immortality and many many references to other science fiction works its worthy of five stars since its a league ahead of anything else ive seen this year and its good to see ridley scott at the top of his game 
many people are saying that this movie has really nothing to do with the alien franchise but it is actually feels like a direct prequel to alien the audience finally knows information on the space jockeys and the space ships they fly people will find anything to criticize this film if those naysayers find one thing odd about it they will say its a horrible film pundits of this film are angered at all of the plot holes in this film but in actuality it may not be a plot hole because if a sequel is made those questions will be answered this is a truly great film and ranks up with the original alien movie for me its the best movie of the year by far also the d effects were the best ive seen since avatar i usually complain about d movies because the effects arent all that great but this film pulls it off extremely well its an edge of your seat thriller and youll be mesmerized hours after seeing it it wont leave your mind so go out there and see it you wont regret it 
the first time i saw this movie i did not like it but i have watched it a few times and it really grew on me as a prequel to the alien movies it makes a lot of sense and adds a completely new direction 
the movie is one of the best sci fi movies in years and the story a brilliant one that gets better with each viewing forget the people who only half watched it they are not paying attention to a hundred little things that the film handles so well it all makes sense is beautiful to look at and one of the most suspensful smart movies in years i wish we had filmmakers out there that would put this much energy and love into the genre highest rattings from me 
i am a syfy fan and love great imaginative films this was really worth the money and worth watching more than once
great visual impact story line actors all in all a great movie would definitely recommend to anyone i know 
prometheus is an amazing scifi epic with the best visuals ive seen in film to date simply put ridley scott shot a breathtakingly beautiful film the real d is amazing and isnt poorly done like in some converted films every frame in this film is beautiful and although limited the computer generated images are stunning also the soundtrack matches the film at least in my opinion i thought it sounded epic as the crew made their discovery the music from the trailers and the teasers isnt actually heard or at least i dont remember hearing it the acting was great from the whole cast i didnt see any notable flaws in the acting the actions of some characters were questionable though why would you move toward a snake like species when youve seen so many unexplained dead bodies already aside from a couple of silly or stupid character choices the actual story is amazing the story is the search for the engineers that may have engineered us the search for our creators it builds a very creepy yet fascinating atmosphere filled with the mystery of life there are many unanswered questions but i think it was done purposely it leaves the door open for the very likely sequel regardless i actually enjoyed the mystery this is the best film ive seen all year and possibly last year as well i dont recommend going into this film expecting a direct prequel to alien since it really isnt it can really standalone but there is a cool treat for alien fans at the end that i actually enjoyed i highly recommend it 
i know people say it isnt logical or a block failure but i really got a kick out of watching the film lots of suspence a pretty good story good and bad motives behind the characters and one hell of a weird twist at the end of the film that you will either make or break your opinion about prometheus the characters also have pretty different personalities and thoughts on the mission they are going on so the film is also pretty dynamic prometheus in my opinion is one of the best sci fi horror films i have seen since battle l a you can say that this review was not helpful and even talk to me about how it has so many flaws but then you would just be taking it too personal and over thinking about it just enjoy the film for what its purpose was meant to be like scream or nightmare on elm street 
i was a bit apprehensive as i had heard and read so many mixed reviews of this film when it was first out so i had waited for the disk release i really liked this movie beautiful visual effects in the movie i hope it gets an oscar for those visuals i read that this was supposed to be a stand alone film and not a prequel to the alien series but to me it is more of a beginning with the possibility of a whole new story arc i dont think it will or should be a restart considering where the alien vs predator series went and just go with the beginning of the entire franchise my opinion if you like this kind of movie and havent seen it yet i along with many others recommend it 
i will try to be brief and without spoilers prometheus is a truly great film and responsibly presented it does have scares and vicerally challenging images there is also some fine acting especially from rapace and fassbender the senseless criticism of the story presented here can be summed up as follows i dont understand what was happening in scene they didnt explain why did i wouldnt have done this doesnt remind me enough of the cameron movie aliens folks that dont want a visually splendid movie that is highly provocative yet accessible should stay away from this film and most films by scott altman etc there are plenty of decent non challenging movies out there for you please let the rest of us have a mature sci fi experience without all the prattering with all due respect 
one of the few movies my wife actually raved about we both thought prometheus was an excellent movie the only things i can say bad about the bd is it took almost minutes for the disc to load on a fast loading machine and the previews were far too many with no way to get past them but to ff but neither of those faults detract from our overall enjoyment of this movie original captivating suspenseful great sci fi adventure we had a good time with this movie great escapism kd 
i believe a lot of critics didnt like this prequel but it left me wanting more i watched the last mins over and over again ridley scott really knows how to create tension and fear in a scene and despite everyone saying it doesnt live up to the original in my opinion it doesnt have to it is a new and thoughtful concept for how it all began that said i found it as riveting and scary in parts as the original what i have always liked about his work is the strong female leads and the fascinating way he creates the creatures with this sort of hybrid sexualized male female anatomy and behavior he always picks fine actors too noomi rapace is great as the lead and michael fassbinder is excellent as the villainous but likable humanoid the visual effects are superb and work to tell the story creating a fascinating environment mood and space if you enjoy thought provoking films then watch this a couple of throw away characters bulk up the cast but as i said it left me wanting more 
 prometheus is excellent this is how the story goes a team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on earth leading them on a thrilling journey to the darkest corners of the universe there they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race the cast led by noomi rapace as elizabeth shaw michael fassbender as david is excellent the directing by ridley scott who also produced is excellent the story screenplay by jon spaihts damon lindelof who also executive produced is excellent the music by marc streitenfeld is excellent the cinematography by dariusz wolski is excellent the film editing by pietro scalia is excellent the casting by avy kaufman nina gold is excellent the production design by arthur max is excellent the art direction by alex cameron anthony caron delion peter dorme marc homes senior art director paul inglis john king supervising art director adam oneill karen wakefield senior art director is excellent the set decoration by sonja klaus is excellent the costume design by janty yates is excellent the stunts coordinated by rob inch stuart clark is excellent the special make up by jo grover josh weston prosthetic make up by valter casotto susie osullivan valentina visintin aacute slaug dr ouml fn sigurard oacute ttir prosthetic effects supervised by conor osullivan is excellent the creature effects coordinated by katie newitt phill woodfine design by waldo mason is excellent the visual effects coordinated by vanessa armitage vfx production coordinator charise e angone jignesh mehta brendan savage jack george jane kyung lee issac lipstadt lara lom abigail mendoza matthew sakata supervised by richard stammers everett burrell paul butterworth vincent cirelli trent claus dick edwards charley henley martin hill edson williams is excellent this is an excellent sci fi film that keeps you thinking and entertained as well it is also a well crafted well made film that is conceptually different than other sci fi films of its kind ridley scotts return to sci fi after years is impressive another excellent film for him as well noomi rapace michael fassbender lead a well rounded cast of characters this is also one of the best movies of the year and of the summer so far 
i just got done watching prometheus and i was blown away i dont know why so many people who have seen this have such a problem with it i thought it was in the top ten of the very best science fiction movies i have ever seen the affects were amazing and it actually made you think instead of just being a mindless horror movie my family and i were on the edge of our seats and were thoroughly entertained 
 i still enjoyed the hell out of it anyway first lets get a major or not considering how often this is covered in movie reviews spoiler out of the way this is not an alien movie it is however set in the same universe do you recall the ship on lv in the first alien movie discovered by the ill fated crew of the nostromo ever wonder who the other aliens were the ones who originally piloted the craft which included the well preserved remains of a giant humanoid featuring a chest wound that only foreshadowed what was to come ridley scott answers those questions you may not like the answers but the answers that ridley scott does provide are plausible and yet raise more questions at the same time where did humanity come from did we originate from elsewhere does life exist elsewhere do ancient sigils hail from somewhere else two archaelogists would love to find out although their opinions differ from the scientific on one end and from faith on the other ridley scott doesnt usually make the same movie twice and if youre expecting a blade runner or alien out of prometheus you will be sorely disappointed prometheus unlike the nostromo is lavishly appointed by its funder mr weyland and features state of the art navigation and equipment unlike the funded for blue collar workers ship the nostromo our crew is also well equipped to map out the areas although they do take questionable risks at times even so what they encounter ultimately will change the origins of the alien mythos and their intended purpose may not be as far off from the vision that weyland yutani had in mind for them later on in the franchise yes youll read in some of the reviews that some characters are cardboard cutouts some lines are cliched and it is also not a game changer in the sci fi genre but what ridley scott still manages to accomplish is an enormous sense of scale in both his world creation environments and scope of story this movie certainly invites additional outings to be sure and with additional questions to be answered i hope that hes on board to continue the ride 
i didnt kno what to expect watching this but wow def a good ridley scott movie the story is good you def should not get up as you may miss a key line or so so make sure u stay seated ok lol get your popcorn n drinks ahead of this movie ppl spec effects are great i love noomi apace she rocks in this film omg most under rated lady actress around in my opinion the film is just different i honestly hope a part is on the horizon i need to kno what comes next at the end of this movie so please dont leave the real fans hanging ok ridley lol
interesting movie story line enjoyed the movie and looking forward to afollow up film enjoyed the pace of the film and seeing idris elba performance inanother film liked the character played by noomi rapace another great filmfrom ridley scott 
not sure what all the hubbub is with the negative comments i loved this movie great space adventure make no hesitation in spending your nickels and dimes on this one do it 
ignore the pretentious sci fi geeks this movie is a great thought provoking picture that adds genuine depth to the alien universe alien is a haunted house movie in space aliens is a terrific sci fi action flick and prometheus is a brilliant piece of modern cinema thrilling scary and beautiful 
despite the mixed reviews we loved this movie and are very happy with the package good packaging and nice to have both blu ray and dvd 
if asked what my favorite type of movie is im apt to respond science fiction yet the genre is a relatively small percentage of my film collection the fact is that they are rarely done well having said that a few rank high on my favorites list two were directed by ridley scott alien and blade runner scotts prometheus will join that list it is no secret at this point but this film is a prequel of sorts to alien not that there is a direct linkage but as scott says theres common dna indeed human dna is a source for this story numerous discovered cave art from across earth have been analyzed to suggest a common cluster of stars and perhaps the origin of human life two prominent scientists who happened to also be romantically attached are hired by wayland corp also from alien to travel to a distant moon to investigate the possibility waylands representative on the trip is a stone faced meredith vickers played by charlize theron reenacting a similar sinister character from the recent snow white and the huntsman as in all the alien films the corporate representatives are never there to help other key characters include scientist charlie holloway logan marshall green a true evolutionist and god fearing girlfriend scientist elizabeth shaw played by noomi rapace the girl who played with fire in another memorable performance the other performance to watch is the amazing michael fassbender haywire as the android called david in an early scene check out how david acquires his personality he emulates blond peter otoole from his favorite movie lawrence of arabia ridley scotts return to the franchise allows him to follow up on the neglected sequence when the space jockey is found in the original film who was he what was he after how did he die where did he come from some questions are answered some will have to wait for a probable sequel and before we get the direct connection to alien scott who always seems to direct films with strong female leads makes no exception here rapaces dr shaw is no shrinking violet and takes the most courageous actions of the ships crew aided by captain janek idris elba she even undergoes a self directed but machine automated surgical procedure which will get you squirming in your seat there are some ever engulfing scenes of the ship prometheus the vastness of space and the confines of caves that are in a word magnificent i saw this movie in d and it looks great there are few if any in your face effects but the overall quality of the camera work is excellent the d adds depth to many of the shots and doesnt darken the picture ultimately the film doesnt answer all the questions but gives us enough to conjure plenty of ideas more please blu ray update i wasnt surprised to find this blu ray transfer to be near perfect since i dont have d at home yet i opted for the blu ray dvd digital copy version the video is in p as you would expect and has a aspect ratio nearly identical to the original theatrical release lighting is a major factor in the film it is dark takes place in space so director scott and his crew had to manage cameras and lighting to get the proper intensity the transfer looks beautiful stunning gorgeous spectacular detail is excellent the audio is likewise perfect the prime track to sample is the dts hd master audio if you have a properly set up rig this soundtrack will knock your socks off the subs and woofers will get a workout but none of the small sounds are missed either the great orchestral score washes over the entire picture optional audio includes dolby digital tracks with enlish descriptive spanish and french there are plenty of interesting special features as well audio commentaries are provided by director producer ridley scott and another by writer john spaihts and writer executive producer damon lindelof there are deleted extended alternate scenes that total about minutes finally there is a segment called the peter weyland files this consists of some video files reflecting some insider info on the fictious weyland corp great movie and blu ray package 
this is a great film well directed well acted stunning special effects and a deep story line ridley scott has exceeded the original alien with this movie it is taut disturbing very byzantine and dark david shows the basic anti organic personality exhibited by all his descendants the end leaves tou wondering when part will come out 
yes there are a lot of gaps in logic yes it is a huge stretch of the imagination yes it would have been better if some of the movie wasnt edited out i truly wish they would have put out an extended version of this movie where the waylan industries speech started the movie this would have made a lot of questions non existant that being said this is a fun movie that provokes the mind to see outside the box and just enjoy a good old sci fi if you like any of the alien movies you will like this and enjoy the ending scenes it is an updated homage to the old films and a good watch 
if you like the alien series or great visuals prometheus is a must see although according to ridley scott it wasnt meant to be a direct prequel you can definitely catch some connections the plot is solid although it does leave you with more questions than answers they are planning a sequel or two as of my last check the acting is amazing and the visuals are incredible along with avatar tron legacy and the avengers prometheus was my favorite d movie to see in theaters they did the d effects incredibly well making sure the effect could be seen throughout the shots if youve heard some flack for the plot not answering enough still give this a try its pros greatly outweigh any cons and just remember theres more to come 
this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie movie video audio prometheus on bluray is a grand sight to behold with great audio and video quality the storyline makes a great start to the alien series and i cant wait for the tie in secondinstallment of the series to be completed must have bluray for your collection 
if you loved the alien movies youll love this prequel the movie is good stars on its own but add the fact it is the prequel it soars 
i am so impressed with this film from the first chords of the majestic soundtrack and the sublime images of landscape it put me in awe i am impressed with the story the cinematography the characters the costume design the sets the spaceship designs the alien designs the cgi and on and on it seems like ridley scott successfully homaged his own alien movie and at the same time successfully homaged a space odyssey the first scenes of the robot android prowling the ship and the crew waking up feels like a perfect blending of the movies no small feat noomi rapace is my favorite actor from her role as lisbeth and here she plays elizabeth and it felt like the movie is her vehicle she is the ultimate survivor and her quest could easily become another trilogy i will mention a few things that i liked but that could have been even better im not complaining the main creator aliens could have been less musclebound and could have had female counterparts i suspect there is more to this story i liked the tentacled aliens and they look and move superbly and i liked that there were or different types in different stages but it is a bit confusing and not completely coherent but if this were reality we would not know what was going on anyway so its ok the part storyline is not apparent at first viewing so we are left wondering what does this mean and where are we now but i caught on quickly enough i am a little tired of tentacled aliens but these are done so well and the action is so realistic and so interesting that i love it the story basically is that a rich guy goes in search of the creators who look like musclebound albinos the rich guy and his crew find them on another planet they investigate they all become infected with various aliens noomi survives and with the robot she goes on in search of the creators home world of course it is all much more complicated than that it is also superiorly beautiful there are fantastic and beautiful special effects all tasteful and very creative the characters are good and beautiful to look at i think there is even an homage to lisbeth salander in the movie and even the character of elizabeth seems like a continuation of lisbeths life and i am very satisfied with it all the ship interiors are gorgeous in fact so much of this film is gorgeous that i am still impressed the story after much thought is pretty darned good and holds up it can cause much debate about human life etc which is the point of good film anyway see it 
what really struck me was how good looking this movie is from the cinematography to the production design this picture is on point its one of my favorites to come out in the past year
for those interested in the d foremost prometheus d was filmed with d cameras not converted from a d source the filmmakers did a splendid job with the parallax d layers in most scenes but dont search for pop out of the screen moments as this isnt designed as such depth reaches far into the screen as would be expected with any d film the rd dimension surely gives this horror sci fi film an extra layer of dimension transporting you into the exploration of these scientists searching for the origin of the human species as they so grimly discover the plethora of gory horror moments are as real as they can get thanks to the well implemented and very effective d does the d look as good as avatar d no but its a very pleasant d experience for sure and a few good notches above most average quality d movies there are scenes that really highlight the d and most of the film conveys impressive d layers for the movie itself if you enjoyed the original alien there is no reason you wont enjoy this patient but tense horror sci fi film fairly reminiscent of the original nightmare discovery of weavers crew in many aspects d strong d throughout d parallax nicely done d depth good depth d pop outs few if any to remember overall d thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the d recommended yes
believe it or not i actually enjoyed this film i thought the crew performed admirably in particlular michael fassbender for me this film pitted faith against solo reason the turin machine against man the search for truth against nihilism nothing nothing annihilation death and perhaps the mad scientists creating their frankensteins the bioweapons who they in turn destroy there seemed to be many subplots themes who or what is the prometheus zeus overcoming his father cronus the kings who do not wish to relinquish their power the created who loose their need for their creators and the creators fearing the growing power of the created so that when they awaken and achieve their freedom it is time to cripple them the cycles of life turn the only apparent connection between this film and alien is the bioweapon and the race of beings that created them and perhaps the same purpose for those bioweapons the destruction or enslavement of the human race on earth i absolutely enjoyed the specail effects i saw the film in d which dramatically boosted the experience and found our titan progenitors interesting i believe this thread demands at least one sequel the search for truth something that transcends the cycles of life and death the desire to know continues 
when i heard that ridley scott was doing a prequel to his original alien i knew that i would not be disappointed what a great film this was regarding the epic story which fits in very well within the alien universe the actors did an amazing job with the characters they portrayed they give off a very convincing performance which makes you care about what happens to them the d effects were the best that i have ever seen usually i dont like d in movies but paying a little extra for the d in prometheus was well worth it ridley scott really knew what he was doing regarding the likable characters epic story and grand scale of effects which makes this film a classic i dont understand why some people nitpick every little detail in this movie its a great film alien prequel and i highly recommend that you see it 
one of the best sci fi films i have seen in a long time the film is stunning to watch on bluray and the score is magnificent the score to me was a cross between john barry and john williams the acting is superb especially the actress that played the archeologist in the lead role and the male lead playing the android the first time i saw the film i really enjoyed it but would have given it only stars it is a lot to absorb i watched it again recently and was surprised about how much more i enjoyed the film the second time around although it is a prequel to alien and directed again by scott the films are very different its not alien blade runner robin hood black rain or gladiator my fave scott films not in order i believe that as a film it stands on its own and ranks to be included in ridley scotts best as well as one of the most introspective sci fi films released in quite some time 
i attended the opening night of prometheus at an imax d theater the movie will undoubtedly receive academy award nominations in all categories the imax d presentation was the finest use of imax d technology that i have ever experienced the d was so excellent that it was literally like sitting in the middle of the action the filmmakers know how to manipulate d and make it look good i get a tingling sensation even thinking about it that is why i pre ordered prometheus in the blu ray d blu ray dvd digital copy version without hesitation this will become a treasured work of timeless cinematic art in my movie collection beyond the existential components of this film prometheus is a true prequel that fully explains the alien anthology also out in blu ray and part of my collection you will understand how it all began and if you view the alternate endings for the films up to the finale alien resurrection the final movie of the alien saga replaced with a feel good ending in theaters you will understand why that ultimate ending was inevitable although the alien saga is a dark journey into the depths of hell so to speak in essence an anthology of humanitys evolution through extinction and rebirth into a new quasi human species over the course of centuries it is existentially worth the dark journey how would you like to have acid for blood i found many epiphanies about this universe and our existence as its intelligent observers perhaps parallel universes are gods proving grounds for intelligent life to decide if they truly want the burden and anguish of becoming like god knowing good and bad atheists theists and agnostics will each find a different interpretation no doubt because it is debatable as to the true implications of prometheus and the alien movies that chronologically follow however theists will find solace in the unstoppable faith of dr shaw perhaps one epiphany and take away from prometheus is life may exist beyond this tiny blue planet the ancient holy texts may be allegories and not literal dr shaw believed god still exists and shall receive her beyond the great veil of reality when her temporal life ends when her tests are over however long that takes god will deliver her from this great void atheists can pay no mind to these implications because prometheus offers plenty of grist for the mill to argue that shaws faith is noble at best that is the beauty of this film prometheus challenges both sides to think carefully about any preconceived fanciful illusions about gods existence as allegorically taught by the church or as dogmatically denied by hardcore nihilists 
having read alot of positive and negative reviews i decided to get this movie on bluray today and make a decision for myself i have to say from the time the movie started till the very end i never found a dull moment to be honest i think alot of people were expecting this film to be similar to aliens with tons of aliens raging about killing people i really didnt want to see another similar flick like that instead i very much appreciated this one it was rather refreshing to say the least i know not everyone agrees but it all boils down to our expectations of a film and how we perceive it as far as the special edition d bluray is concerned i did have a problem with mines when it started to break up in blocks around hour minutes into the movie then the problem got worse and the picture became all fuzzy and froze i couldnt operate the remote or power it off so i had to unplug the player from the outlet power it back on and eject the disc i have read on avsforum com that certain batches of this bluray dvd have the same problem i decided to load the regular dvd and continued watching from that point onwards with no issues at all i must say despite the problem i encountered with my bluray disc i will still rate the picture quality as and the sound is fantastic as well i never had to adjust my volume control like i have had to on some other movies when it came to the dialogue and action heres an update for october p m ok there is a solution ive found for those defective discs ofcourse you have all read my dilemma with the bluray disc but here is what i did and it worked flawlessly go to the players own menu go setup bd dvd viewing settings bd internet connection do not allow or disable you will need to turn it back on after youre through watching the film for your other applications if need be hope this helps all of you keep me posted thanks 
good action movie great d action and color loved all the action shots and picture quality a must watch movie 
i loved the engineers cinematography story and visuals in this film yes this is a different alien universe im okay with that many of the mysteries that are hinted at in the previous alien movies are not solved here i think that is why many viewers were disappointed standing on its own i enjoyed it 
a lot of people went into this film thinking that it would explain everything there was to know about alien and everyone seems to forget that they already have a sequel in the works many people criticize this movie for not having all the answers but isnt that the point of a great movie to ask the audience questions the sense of mystery is what makes this film great and basically every other film out there great everyone seems to avoid the fact that alien raised many questions and left many of them unanswered maybe even more than prometheus a space odyssey is exactly the same way but that film is praised and prometheus should be as well this film does not rip off of alien in any way shape or form it is similar in many aspects but doesnt just show the same old thing it has a very strong female lead with noomi rapace a tense horrifying atmosphere and it looks fantastic just like alien did and this is a sure sign that ridley scott is back and better than ever i absolutely loved this film 
good sci fi doesnt come along very often anymore this is an exceptionally well made movie with a great story and great acting i know it has had so so reviews which i dont understand i watched it a second time to confirm what i already thought and i thought it was better than i st thought a lot of the story came together the second time around and i felt blown away really i highly recommend this movie 
we get a beginning on how humans became to be and who created us and for what reason also how the aliens were created and for what reason hope there is a sequel to this prequel 
i was completely blew away by this film i am a huge fan of the first alien and this film finally answered a few questions about where the xenomorph derives from i will not tell much about this film only that it is definitely one of the best films of the year it was also nice to see ridley scott return to the genre which he does the best this film is definitely a must see for sci fi alien film fans i would categorize it as one of the best sci fi films ever made and definitely the best of the st century 
this film seen in theaters is a jarring brutal astonishing tour de force on dvd is more privately engrossing but no less powerful picture is great sound especially the wonderful music score is marvelous a n appropriate beginning to the alien triology 
more than a thousand have already provided summaries and opinions on the movie itself and its relationship to the alien films so my review and rating is based solely upon the quality of the transfer of the film to blu ray video quality the transfer to blu ray is exceptional with for the most part warm color grading and sharp contrast details are clearly defined even in the darker areas of the film at no point did i see any ringing as a result of the cgi scenes and no artifacting was ever noticed either grain was never present that i could see and i can find absolutely no fault in any of the films presence on this blu ray disc audio quality i was very excited that this blu ray offered a choice between a dts ma hd and audio both are a lossless codec which will always provide a clearer and more transparent dialogue soundtrack and foley effects since i do watch and listen on a hi end audio system that they provided a choice is always a treat my system includes a center channel two front left and right speakers two rear side channels where my listening position is and two left and right rear channels the audio tracking included a great many discreet channeling pans and foleys to the side front and rear channels creating a very immersive audio experience to be honest i did not notice any discreet channeling to the last two rear channels while they contributed greatly to the audio immersion effect discreet foley audio from those channels were not heard i have watched and listened to this film in a mode and could tell very little difference between the and mix thus i was a touch disappointed with the mix never the less the audio is exceptionally good no matter what type of system you are using and this along with the beautifully produced video is why i gave the film stars as a movie itself it would not have been so highly rated extras several deleted and alternate scenes which i always enjoy and the commentary regarding these scenes was really quite interesting also included are a couple of full film commentaries which i have not listened to a hard disc digital copy is also included in the package with choices between downloading to either ultra violet which i do not like and itunes which to me is the way to go you do have to enter the redemption code which is included on the insert with the disc downloading to itunes took about minutes well if you do like prometheus as a film than you will certainly want to include the blu ray copy within your collection of films the quality of the disc is excellent i do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase thanks for reading 
cant say enough good things about this movie its so well done couldnt have asked for more i am a big fan of the alien series and all the movies provide just a pinch of background history about who and what these aliens might be and be from this movie finally gets around to answering some of those questions but in a new fresh way its scary at times its action packed the actors are all amazing and there are so many little details with meaning that i have watched this movie times and still see something new each time leaves you wanting more cant wait till the next movie comes out 
best aliens movie to date dont listen to the haters great story great visuals as a fan of the series i loved it
prometheus is a worthy prequel to the alien franchise however keep in mind this is not alien this is a whole new set of creatures a whole new set of questions and very few real answers this film focuses on the reality behind asking questions that may not even have a satisfactory answer it also shows how one answer just leads to a new array of questions the film is true eye candy for the scifi fan in every sense of the word from the opening scene to the final moments you cannot take you eyes off the screen reading the other reviews it seems like those who dont like this film either do not understand the history behind it are not intrigued by the bigger mysteries of life or are just wanting to munch their popcorn to other mindless schlock that hollywood barfs out and calls movies thee days prometheus is going to make you think and entertain you while doing so if you are up for the adventure then check it out 
who created us that is perhaps one of the greatest questions ever asked by mankind and is the driving idea at the center of ridley scotts new science fiction adventure prometheus the first entry of a proposed trilogy from the celebrated british director who brought us alien and blade runner this story detailing a possible origin of mankind follows journey of a research team traveling in a spaceship years away from home in search of their creators prometheus is a fantastic looking movie set in the same fictional universe as ridley scotts sci fi horror classic alien and uses the mythology suggested by dan obannons original script to fashion an entirely new sci fi adventure prometheus is the name of a trillion dollar research vessel created by weyland industries a science team along with an assorted group of professionals has been recruited to find a planet that has been depicted in numerous cave paintings back on earth dr elizabeth shaw noomi rapace swedens original girl with the dragon tattoo and her lover charlie holloway logan marshal green leads the science team under the critical cold gaze of meredith vickers charlize theron it takes over two years for the prometheus to reach lv during which the human crew is watched over by david michael fassbender a highly advanced robotic organism programmed to simulate human life once they arrive on lv they discover a structure left behind by the previous inhabitants there shaw and her science team searches for the key to mankinds creation but instead finds a weapon with the potential of destroying all life on earth the break out character of the movie is michael fassbender as david we meet david going about his daily routines while the rest of the crew is asleep in one of the best scenes the movie offers in ways of character development david eats watches over the crew plays basketball by himself learns new languages and memorizes lines from his favorite movie lawrence of arabia heres how id descrive this character imagine if hal from a space odyssey could take human form if you could see him actually grappling and occasionally hinting at signs of having developed genuine emotions that is david as elizabeth shaw noomi rapaces first leading role in an english language movie begins shaky but by the end of the movie shes hit her stride bringing elizabeth shaw to life her performance lacks the subtle nuance of her portrayal of lisbeth salander in the original girl with the dragon tattoo but it does pack a punch by the end of the film she does firmly step into her action heroine shoes a character i liked that not many people talk about as much is the prometheuss captain janek an underutilized character who had more potential than the movie allowed him he starts off as an outsider to the worlds of shaw vickers and the expedition but by the end has completely devoted himself to it ridley scotts stylish direction played a huge part in cementing alien and blade runner as two of the movie worlds science fiction masterpieces and there is no doubt that prometheus is a great looking movie when ridley scott does science fiction he knows how to make it look right and that still holds true thirty years after blade runner the full scale sets are fantastic there are plenty of great special effects you shouldnt wait to see this movie on your home television it needs to be seen on a big screen that brings me to d i saw this movie in imax d and it is one of the best movies ive seen in d that being said i still fail to see why on earth anyone cares about d ive given coraline avatar tron legacy hugo and prometheus a fair chance to dazzle me with this recent development in price raising i mean exciting technology these are some of the best movies to see d in and yes they look good but all of them ive also enjoyed just as much if not better in d if you really are obsessed with d then yes knock yourself out youre going to have a blast but if youre like me and still arent sold on d this movie will not be an eye opener the most important thing one needs to understand before sitting down for ridley scotts prometheus this is not an alien movie it takes place in the same universe as alien has visual elements of alien has locations and even the fledgling evolutionary stage of what will become the monsters of the classic but alone prometheus is not a straight up alien prequel prometheus is a standalone science fiction adventure and it is one that in my humble opinion works extraordinarily well ridley scott announced he intends prometheus to be the first part of a science fiction trilogy set within the alien universe that means you should expect h r gigers infamous monsters to be leaping around this movie is about the creation of man with the creation of what ultimately becomes the xenomorphs by the time the nostromo arrives at lv in the first alien movie do not go into prometheus expecting a direct alien prequel i feel i need to clarify that prometheus is not an alien movie because too many disappointed annoyed or downright angered reviewers are coming down hard on prometheus for not filling the shows or delivering the same goods of ridley scotts classic to go in expecting another alien movie would be to set yourself up for disappointment this is prometheus part of a new science fiction trilogy it is not ridley scotts alien electric boogaloo at times prometheus is a bit in over its head with the scope of its ambition but at the same time i love this idea of searching for a possible extra terrestrial root to mans dna sure the plot has been done several times in books but only a few times in movies and i honestly feel prometheus has done a better job of it than does other films prometheus isnt alien but it is a damn good first step for what could be a great new series for what its worth i loved prometheus even with its flaws heres to the hopes of a brilliant trilogy from sir ridley scott 
well thought out movie plot great visuals good acting some innovative characters the movie makes you think like all sci fi movies there are a few hiccups but overall this is a great sci fi movie watch it 
the movie is within the same universe as ridley scotts alien however years prior and on a separate planet the story is nearly all original in a different direction with easter eggs of what will someday lead to elements in alien such as the weyland company and the space jockey s this film does not bring us to the beginning of that film the elements exist but the story moves in another direction there are enough pieces to answer some questions in alien but open ideas to new questions for this science fiction thriller questions posed by the lead character have hints of answers but most are not revealed as any good science fiction story would it asks you to think instead of leading you to obvious ends the planned sequel may provide ridley scotts answers but we have a few years to guess where this adventure might end plenty of clues in christian ethos are planted within the films dialog and on the screen at important parts in the film pay attention even to dates in question 
ive heard a lot of reviews written by fans of the book by max brooks and many of them are negative because they were expecting to see the book made into a movie simply put this is not the same story from the book however its still a great zombie film in fact its easily one of my favorite zombie movies of all time if youre a fan of zombies whether youve read the book world war z or not i recommend reading it btw you will definitely have a good time watching this film while theres not a lot of gore as in most zombie films the zombies are pretty creepy and theres lots of em and theres enough tension to keep things interesting throughout if youre on the fence about seeing this movie let me give you a small nudge to check it out you wont be disappointed just dont expect to see the book made into a movie 
awesome action the whole way through effects were epic will watch it again book much different but what the heck ta 
edge of seat flick from start to finish well written very credible apocalyptic plot that kept an intense pace from the opening scene the visual effects were unique ambitious in portraying the massive scope of horror that would accompany a world wide outbreak of a deadly epidemic the acting was very well crafted to the plot the cinematography was awesome excellent flick highly recommend it as one the best of its genre 
when i started watching this movie i thought thats just great another dragging around zombie movie but i was pleasantly surprised nothing like the cheap ones this had a story brad pitt was excellent i forgot he was brad pitt 
i really did not expect much of this film last summer not being much of a brad pitt fan or of director marc foster the man who directed one of my least favorite bond films quantum of solace furthermore like many i had heard the stories of a confused script and a new ending forced to be filmed however upon seeing the film i found it to be a gripping and intense experience i watched the blu ray unrated version yesterday and my opinion hasnt changed this is an epic film of a world catastrophe going from philadelphia actually scotland to north korea to israel actually malta and a tense conclusion in wales like so many of the films of today this film would not have been possible without cgi particularly the scene of thousands of zombies climbing over each other to get over an enormous wall protecting jerusalem probably the type of wall we could use along our porous southern border unlike the walking dead where the world suffers a similar disaster these zombies do not shamble along they run and run fast and they bite thats the way the zombie virus is spread pitt is surprisingly good and he should be since he is one of the films producers i also like mirielle enos as his wife ive enjoyed her on the amc series the killing and since she is always so grim and depressed on that series it is nice to see her play a normal role and actually smile here although to be frank the events of this film do not really give one much to smile about as stated this is an unrated cut there were some scenes that did not seem too familiar to me although i have to admit that i dont remember what they were the picture and sound on the blu ray were fine the special features consisted of several relatively short documentaries on the making of the film this is not a peter jackson film with hours of special features the making of documentaries were fine and just about everyone was interviewed with the exception of pitt i guess he was too busy in conclusion this is a very exciting fairly violent and bloody epic that keeps the suspense and your interest up throughout as stated i did not expect all that much of it but it turned out to be one of my favorite films of last summer right behind star trek and man of steel check it out you wont be bored 
the production values make this a film worth seeing if you are into a class tale of apocalyptic zombism then world war z will entertain the reality based narrative style of world war z impressed me the acting also is top notch brad pitt is very convincing and very engaging in his role his screen presence alone is a big factor why this film works along with the excellent production values and director marc forsters very artistic eye for storytelling quantum of solace monsters ball finding neverland this film is rather exceptional 
apparently this movie went through a lot of re shoots and re edits to make it better and the work they put into it shows not too much pre amble before the action kicks in very near the start some genuine scary and tension filled edge of your seat moments you really feel like youre in the middle of it if you cant get on board with the notion of people becoming zombies then you probably wont get into it im not a typical zombie film lover and i really liked this movie a lot of action too a tension filled worthwhile movie experience 
 stars masterpiecetruly a zombie movie of such scope that weve never seen the likes of it before days later weeks later hinted at it with great success but here is a film that is so vast so all encompassing that it captured the essence of a world apocalyptic movie besieged by zombies in all its awesome fearsome dread panic mayhem not to mention plenty of suspense no this is not your average traditional zombie fodder with zombies all over the place looking like they should be arrested for public intoxication you wouldnt believe a bunch of drunks could take over the world would you no neither would i believe zombies that couldnt pass the straight line walking test let alone take five minutes to finish it could ever be a threat to the living but these zombies this zombie film are realistic a different breed apart when i say realistic this is a zombie film so lets keep it in context days later weeks later the remake of dawn of the dead are the only films that i could swallow the human race falling extinct to the new breed of the zombie genre film though these are not the first zombie films to use super fast zombies on the opposite end traditional zombies there is no traditional zombie film in existence that could make me believe that zombies who move as slow are as physically handicapped as a person who just drank a fifth in two hours of proof whiskey could take over the world on the other hand these world war z zombies were very believable as antagonists challenging the world they were fast feral hungry they had practically the whole world population infected in a very short time the scenes of them climbing over each other like ants crossing water over their own drowned to attack the living was just spellbinding as was the scene with the nuclear bomb going off miraculously potent scenes that are a direct allegory to world terrorism but this film had scenes of personal tragedy sacrifice heroism too the lab scene was a tense personal portrait of brave martyrs as dozens of zombies are ready to scamper over each other like rats ready to chew on our protagonists body parts with the slightest sound while the rest of the lab scientists technicians looked on through video cameras with horror hope that they make it back the start of the movie where the family is running fighting for their lives heart pounding intensity of human survival at it most basic instinct protect your loved ones yourself when i say realistic i mean there was no dumb moves in this film by pitt or any of the main characters not like the multitude of dumb moves in films like the original dawn of the dead not even to mention the ridiculous its so bad its good no i take that back it was not good it was really bad day of the dead this is not a film where everyone knows they shouldnt stick their hand in a zombies mouth less be bitten but do it anyway it was not filled with idiotic lets get killed to build a body count horror clich eacute s when i say realistic i mean the way pitt scientist found to get around the zombies how they figured it out i wont go into detail spoil the movie world war z in my opinion is the best zombie movie ever made why the acting the direction the editing the plot top flight the combining of horror action war movie genres blending perfectly together in an awe inspiring demonstration of movie magic a film perfectly complimenting its theme the end of the world as we know it maybe most impressive is this at the theater not a single person hardly made a noise they were totally absorbed in the spectacle of this film no cheap jump tactics to make them gasp for this film needed none no gallons of blood buckets of gore for this film needed none only the suspense dread of what was going to happen next yes you know its a great horror film when the audience is silent this is a thinking persons zombie film just when you thought the zombies ran out of brains to eat 
world war z is brad pitts zombie epic about the spread of a virus that turns people into the undead but instead of walking they sprint and create chaos with every step pitt plays gerry lane a former un investigator who is called into action by an old friend when the human race is on the brink of extinction while he risks his life to look for a cure his family with his wife karin played by the incredible mireille enos is on a us navy carrier out at sea nations fall people turn on each other and it seems all is lost but this is not the case as gerry begins piecing together clues and starts a search that will change everything leading to the war wwz is a truly impressive movie especially considering its a pg zombie movie while i do like the gore in a zombie film this movie proved you dont need it the zombies were frightening the realistic science was there warfare is taken into account and overall it just felt like what would really happen if the zombie apocalypse happened marc forsters directing was superb showcasing both the epic scale of a global panic and war while showing us the smaller battles and struggles that are happening everywhere else this movie has the perfect transition going from the massive blockbuster to a classic zombie movie setting when it comes to acting it was great there were only two moments where the dialogue didnt quite match when gerry talks to warmbrunn about the wall in jerusalem and even though there wont be any awards the acting was still great the visuals were happily polished being more realistic especially having both cg and practical zombies with amazing make up you can see my review of the musical score on the soundtracks page by marco beltrami but then there is the cinematography words cannot describe how impressive it was to see all the locations and sites especially jerusalem plus this is only the start wwz kick starts what should and can be a trilogy just showing us the outbreak spread and beginning struggles with the undead there is so much more to come world war z is not for everyone but anyone who appreciates well made action movies a thrilling epic or some good freak out moments this is your treat the beginning of a new epic and it paid off in full
loved it the suspenseful fun of a zombie movie without the excessive blood and guts that make the walking dead nausiating the writers transformed an impossible to adapt book into a great movie it never feels repetitive and was engaging the whole way through a must see for all zombie movie fans 
the summer of has not been a good one for movies again and again ive been treated to mediocre blockbusters from the dreadful iron man to the disappointing star trek into darkness and meh man of steel when the best movie ive seen all summer was the underrated sci fi tom cruise movie oblivion which wasnt all that great either you know its a bad summer for movies nothing even came close to wowing me world war z on the other hand delivered exactly what ive always wanted from a zombie movie typically there are two types of zombie films theres the romero formula where a handful of survivors barricade themselves in a bunker of some kind be it a house a mall an underground facility etc and attempt to wait out the storm or the day later the walking dead story set a month or so after the war is already lost as the heros fight to survive in the post apocalyptic world people like to complain that zombie movies have been played out but if you really think about it when it comes to bigger budgeted zombie movies almost every single one has followed one of these two formulas as much as i love zombie movies ive always wanted to see a big epic war of the zombies that never happens i cannot think of one example of a decently budgeted zombie movie where we get to see the infection spread in real time and the worlds governments attempts to fight it as a fellow fan of the books both world war z and the equally fun zombie survival guide i understand the skepticism of many fans towards this movie no its not a faithful adaption yes the only similarities are the title the character names and a few situations i get it we fans are the hardest people in the world to please and theres nothing we like less than an unfaithful adaption of a book we love if thats going to be your hang up i understand and this is not the movie for you however if you are willing to overlook this fact and watch this as its own standalone movie then what awaits you is easily the best movie of the summer and one of the best zombie movies of all time besides romeros original trilogy no other zombie film ive seen can touch world war z it is the most epic most intense most nerve racking and scariest zombie film ive ever seen and ive seen them all no its not nearly as smart as the original dawn of the dead or day of the dead and isnt quite as scary as night of the living dead but the shear scope of this film overshadows at times even romeros best efforts i was legitimately scared by this film that hasnt happened since i saw night of the living dead for the first time zombies dont scare me they just dont but world war z managed to do just that the movie waste no time putting us right in the middle of the action apart from the opening or the ps game the last of us i dont think ive ever been as impressed with an opening to a movie like this twenty minutes into it philadelphia is a blasted ruin new jersey is in chaos the president is dead and the military forced to fight the plague from the safety of their atlantic fleet from there on we get to witness brad pitt as he zips around the world from pennsylvania to south korea to israel in an attempt to find the origins and hopefully a cure for the plague everywhere he goes the pace of the film is kept fast tense and in your face sure its gets kind of predictable as time goes by pitt goes to location a zombies attack he escapes goes to location b zombies attack he escapes etc etc etc this would have really been better as a miniseries as it feels sort of episodic in nature and tries to cram a lot of locations and scenarios into its two hour run time but frankly i felt they did this really well though the locations may change the tone and pacing are very consistent for the first three fourths of the movie and pitt being the great actor he is holds the film together even as his adventure spans the globe it never felt choppy or disjointed or like this was supposed to be a much longer story that was crammed into one shorter film it all flowed surprisingly well and the fast pace kept my attention better than any action blockbuster this year the formula is broken at the end when the film changes from non stop action to slow scary suspense but again though i thought they did this remarkably well i want to also give major kudos to those who made the decision to make the zombies the way they are besides return of the living dead this film has the most unstoppable zombies of any zombie film ever sometimes a bite takes ten seconds to turn someone sometimes it takes a day this allows for the outbreak to be extremely fast as we see in the opening but also allows for infected individuals to go undetected for long periods of time only to turn when inside a safe zone this combined with the fact that only head shots bring them down and that they are able to climb over walls like a swarm of ants not to mention they have magical jumping skills makes these easily the scariest zombies ever put to film lets face it making zombies a realistic threat to humanities survival isnt easy but this movie makes the scenario frighteningly real the speed with which the infection spreads and the ferocity of the zombies themselves makes for some very intense sequences as for negatives this movie does push the boundary on what we as an audience can be expected to believe i can accept that zombies are impervious to pain dont ever get tired can climb on top of each other etc what i dont buy is when they fall off a huge freaking wall and dont break every bone in their bodies it also gets really ridiculous the things brad pitt survives he survives more potently fatal situations then superman and comes away with barely a scratch its a little silly that way but what action movie isnt so if you are a fan of zombie movies or just want a really fun action adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours i cant recommend world war z enough if youve been dying to see an epic globe spanning zombie film like i have there is no way you can miss this 
 through those eyes of his lends credence to the zombie apocalypse genre in a way i didnt expect im not a critic so i wouldnt know how to elaborate the special effects are superb continuity is solid but the realism of one man safely arriving exploring and escaping so many geographical locations when entire armies are collapsing around him kind of suspends the suspension of disbelief but that didnt stop me for cheering the guy on to its clever and uplifting conclusion that leaves things wide open for a sequel
brad pitt was really awesome this film started as exciting as war of worlds and resident evil the ending was not as exciting as the beginning all in all enjoyed it tremendously 
fantastic movie brad pitt just nailed this zombie movie which is basically a horror b grade genre pitt elevated it to a classy act with high octane action which was like wow starts with a bang and keeps on firing leaving you breathless i went through all sorts of emotions while watching this immensely entertaining movie the girl who played pitts wife did a commendable job and was given good footage but it has to be the tomboyish israeli actress who won my heart with her touching performance pitt saves her life but when he is hurt she who is herself injured helps him in a scene which was almost biblical a must watch 
as a big zombie fan if we watch world war z knowing its intended to be a pg movie well know right away this isnt going to feature the blood and guts like any r or unrated zombie movie youve seen would it have been more drastic and horrifying with gore probably but what is not seen and imagined can also be effective see the original texas chainsaw massacre keeping that in mind wwz delivers on its intentions put yourself in the shoes of the lead character and youre cast into a hellish world where a sudden outbreak of rabies as they first called it spreads like wildfire in the cities causing havoc all around in a desperate effort to escape the horror pitts characters goal is to get his family to safety and in doing so is obligated to find the origin of the disease that has taken over the entire world wwz is tension filled most of the way and fills the screen with overwhelming amounts of zombies in some very unique and original ways not often seen in a zombie movie these zombies are dormant shamblers when not stimulated by movers but sound instigates them and they sprint to life attempting to bite anyone who can serve as a host which brings up a major plot point by the way the ending sequence closes the film brilliantly requiring some clever tactics along with agility and speed as the zombies tend to amplify their ability to run and leap oftentimes jumping off rooftops smashing to the ground getting up and continuing the chase zombies locations major city israel desert city airplane night time airport day time airport apartment building research facility with white painted walls which would have been perfect for some blood if this was r d the d in wwz looks very dimensional with visible pieces that bring depth at a higher level youd expect a d film to render it a success in d which also increases the dread of each horror scene in addition to the powered d dimension there are many instances where objects pop out of the screen worthy of a good flinch back movie d 
awesome movie but what brad pitt movie isnt action suspence and a great story totally worth buying and watching again 
the unrated cut runs about minutes longer than the theatrical cut and primarily contains additional action shots nothing major director marc forster has said that the theatrical cut is the directors cut which also unfortunately means that we will not be seeing any footage from the discarded battle of moscow except for a few quick scenes in the closing montage and the matthew fox subplot the unrated cut is the one to get it contains slightly more gore but not gratuitously so than the theatrical cut and the action scenes are more fluid and less choppy ive listed the primary differences between the unrated cut and the theatrical cut below note spoilers follow below so read at your own risk when zombies are shot stabbed curb stomped etc they spew cg black blood when people are bitten theres more cg red blood during the opening scene in philadelphia there are more scenes of pandemonium and zombies getting shot and or biting humans the segment with the red t shirted male here comes the number train being bitten and transformed into a zeke is longer and more violent at the nj mart when gerry is looking for albuterol for his daughter the camera pans down to show a dead body lying in a pool of blood suggesting that the pharmacy employee shot him the chase scene from the alleyway to the apartment is longer and more harrowing gerry headshots a zombie and shoots a few others also crushing a security guard zombie with a filing cabinet in the theatrical cut this zombie chase scene is instead used during the lanes early morning escape to the apartments rooftop the escape scene to the apartment rooftop is now longer and more violent gerry bayonets shoots or rifle butts many more zombies in a surprising twist tomas saves gerry from a zeke rather than gerry himself shooting the zeke in the theatrical cut matthew foxs parajumper character also shoots a few more zombies and theres more zombie blood when theyre shot when dr fassbach trips and accidentally shoots himself in the head the wound is more graphic chunks of his back skull are blown into the air and gore covers the exit ramp of the c although this description sounds graphic the camera cuts away quickly so that only brief glimpses of gore are seen by the audience david morses character graphically pulls out his last remaining tooth in the unrated cut this is not shown in the theatrical cut the battle for jerusalem has additional action shots its now a thrilling and intense sequence in the unrated cut more idf soldiers shooting zekes more zekes biting people grenades blowing up zekes etc when gerry cuts off segens hand in the unrated cut we see the bloody stump as well as geysers of cg blood this is definitely graphic and not for the faint of heart the zombie attack on belarus airways is now more intense with passengers getting bitten left and right there is more cg blood too but nothing too explicit since most of the shots are very quick gerry takes down a few zekes in the who facility more graphically he clotheslines one zeke with a crowbar and stomps on the face of another more cg black blood prior to watching world war z i had mixed feelings about the movie based on the trailers i had seen fast zombies blasphemy i ended up enjoying the movie even with damon lindelofs rewritten third act the ending on a quiet but hopeful note was a better conclusion than the rumored battle of moscow the idea of using a temporary but curable disease as camouflage was a unique plot point cant wait for the sequel even if it has very little to do with max brooks original books 
this movie was soooo good i have bought a lot this year and this is in the top to movies for me well worth the power to run the tv 
possibly one of the most hyped zombie films since the night of the living dead is days later and having seen both of those iconic movies along with countless others i can confidently say that world war z easily outranks em as far as pure entertainment and not to mention its truly epic hey before ya press the no button under was this review helpful listen to my case what wwz has brad pitt this is coming from a non fan btw who is not only ridiculously handsome as always but a good enough actor to make us believe hes a post apocalyptic special envoy for the u n and a pretty tough survivor type to boot action and im not talking about stupid hollywood over the top fluff but riveting events which we can get caught up in without eclipsing the underlying story or defying credibility not too much anyway zombies par excellence this is how the undead should look and im totally ok with them occasionally moving at leopard speed or building zombie pyramids cuz it all fits in with them no longer being human and finally a great script aided by a filming style which enhances the overall level of dramatic intensity and allows the viewer to take this story seriously when i think of all the cheesy and terrible zombie films made over the last years and yet try to view wwz as its own production rather than through the lens of past genre benchmarks then i must give it a star for the reasons ive already mentioned as well as originality o 
action thriller with very good special effects cant wait for the second part or at least i hope that a second part comes out wwz has the potential to be a very good series 
unbelieveably real story here i had to watch it twice this movie imacts the mind and soul in so many ways brace yourself for an extremely realistic real life drama superb acting and screenwriting it will grab you and stay with you for a long time it is adult mature in its nature so watch with caution it pulls no punches 
i have seen many movies and none have ever touched my soul the way this sings to it i have never felt enthralled in a mans struggle to live than when watching this amazing movie it brought a sense of hope for the humanity in side all of us it was extremely entertaining and has beyond oscar worthy performances and choreography and is literally the most dynamic story i have ever seen in a long long time flight is the embodiment of the human soul and all its experiences anyone who loves amazing movies and original stories should definitely see this film 
i am a huge fan of denzel washington and just to see another side of him in this filmreally made me look at him as one of the greatest actors of all time this is a great movie
done well from the video and audio standpoints and very well acted this movie was very real and an honest look at alcohol and drug use as an aside drugs and alcohol have an effect on all humans some good and some bad but have an effect they do some addicts simply obtain their jobs through skills learned at a young age prior to drug and alcohol use which may eliminate many adult people that job coupled with an income and a bit of freedom might then lead them to alcohol or drug abuse i saw this first hand as an air traffic controller and those persons were eliminated as well 
very well done flight scenes even though a bit unbelievable to the portrayal of the drug alcohol addicted pilot plaed by denzel washington washington did an outstanding job the script came to a surprising end but very well played 
denzel washington at his best great story denzel takes the character to the max sometimes you love him then you hate him 
just when i thought this great actor showed us all he had which is pretty darn good he pulls this out of his pocket and does a great job doing something hes never done before i wont say anything but if you havent seen this movie go get it now 
i usually am very hostile towards those who hate movies i love but i can understand why some would be turned off by flight its not about a plane crash its an incredible scene that many of those who disliked the film give its due credit in their critical reviews but its just a part of what the film is about the film is about a functioning junkie who when given the chance to save himself chooses instead to throw his body on a grenade what a glorious feeling it is to know you had the courage to do the right thing even though it means youll get punished for it i respect that the intense substance abuse may not be for everyone but for those who appreciate extraordinary classic film storytelling zemeckis stands with scorsese and fincher as an american da vinci level talent thank you bob 
this is a great film with an amazing performance by denzel it captures the spirit of addiction lies and truth it has the perfect ending an ending that i am glad came because any other choice would have been sickening 
im going to say there might be minor spoilers in this review but if youve seen the trailers youve seen most of what i write about there is a pee your pants airplane crash to start the story off but what this movie is about truly about is substance abuse and its effect on the abuser and those around him her and it is one of the better movies ive seen on that subject pilot whip whitaker miraculously lands his damaged plane while heavily under the influence of more than one addictive substance does it matter that no one believes that any other pilot could have landed this plane sober or not washington plays a gut wrenching role of a man struggling with his demons masterful there were some excellent co stars in the movie too kelly reilly don cheadle john goodman were just some of a superb cast reilly especially in her role as nicole who has her own demons to fight was splendid note there is some nudity in this movie and excessive alcohol and other substance use 
i enjoyed this movie and in addition it reminded me that alcholism is a terrible disease at first i was angry at him and his drinking but later during his hearing i felt sorry for him to be addicted to the point that other human lives do not matter is certainly repulsive but curable i had to look at the flying scenes twice the first time it scared me and the second time i was in awe of all that happened and how it was handled 
washington is extraordinary the cockpit scenes where he is effortlessly in control are worth the price of the film the film is actually quite deft and subtle it is a good drama i cant think of a more compelling american actor around than dw he is often overlooked because he doesnt play the hollywood game but is apparently a decent family man 
denzel washington has always been one of my favorite actors he just gets better with time i thought he was great in training day well he surpassed that in this movie should have received another oscar nod or award for this part i watched it three times back to back a must have for your movie collection 
denzel never gives a bad performance and this is no exception however the story almost seems like it is produced by aa as it deals with the tragedy of alcoholism 
in flight when john goodmans drug dealer enters the picture hes accompanied on the soundtrack with the rolling stones sympathy for the devil this theme could very well be the theme for airline pilot whip whitaker denzel washington there isnt a controlled substance whitaker doesnt like hes even prone to sniffing oxygen before takeoff on a routine flight form orlando and atlanta a midair accident occurs more than likely its due to mechanical failure regardless despite his inebriated state whitaker lands the plane with only four casualties among the hundred people aboard despite his heroics questions will inevitably be asked thats okay because whitaker has any number of enablers toxicology reports quash them while youre at it attribute the two empty liquor bottles to the dead flight attendant everybody is willing to make whitaker a hero but can he face himself in the mirror from beginning to end flight is a fascinating character study whitaker is probably one of the more interesting characters youll encounter in any film washington ingeniously enacts his complexities to make him sympathetic to the audience flight is one the best films of last year or any year 
this movie is very gripping and denzel is a great actor he saved many lives in this movie had a great story line 
denzel performs wonderfully great plot and well worth the timei would agree with the picture caption this is a powerful movie
people who have no first hand experience with alcoholism may find this movie a little over the top no pun intended however it is the most realistic depiction of alcoholism in the cinema i have ever seen and that includes such films as the lost weekend days of wine and roses and leaving las vegas every aspect of this movie is first rate and reveals the insanity of alcoholic behavior exactly as it is those who are not in recovery or who dont know anyone who is will probably neither understand nor appreciate the progressive self destructive and ultimately fatal nature of this disease but the fact is everything in this film rings all too true kudos to the entire cast and crew for an all around brilliant job 
we watched this before we knew about the oscar nominations it was so good i didnt want it to end 
what an original mesmerizing film if you want to be twisted back and forth between what is morally right and heroism this is the film to watch it is excellent i watched it three times gets even better the second and third time i am still thinking about this film a week later 
in todays movie market there are not many that i can rate stars this is a movie i am happy to give stars it is well written well acted well cast and it carries a message i hope you find it so as well 
enjoyed watching one of my favorite actors in a tense personal crisis story from careless but lucky living to realization of personal responsibility a fine telling of a tale 
just watched this movie with my g friend and her mother last night for the th time denzell and cast are wonderful john goodman as a drug dealer was pitch perfect and the whole idea of going from hero and zero within the space of one drink is well thought out good pace and jarring at times don cheldle and bruce green wood both deliver knock out performacne but it is denzells performacne that take the cake 
this is the best movie if this year i think you will be on the tip of the seat it is a real ride a must see movie
denzel washington does it again this man is a superb actor he made the movie the movie did not make him his protrail of an acholic pilot brought it true to life the movie was great 
hitting pretty close to home the human story told here is more than just powerful maybe it could even be life changing i recommended it to a close family member and i did have a hidden agenda denzel washington is either one of the best actors of our time or he has some personal experiences we didnt know about maybe its both of these wow you may want to stop watching about halfway through the movie but stick around for the ending it is worth it its about time our media provided an uplifting message rather than just gyrating body parts 
saw this one in theater and watched again streaming at home excellent script directing and performances by denzel washington don cheadle john goodman a scene stealer kelly reilly bruce greenwood not exactly what you expect from the trailers a well done portrait of a complicated troubled self destructive man whose life is spiraling out of control in the middle of a media frenzy forcused on a heroic act in which he defies all odds and saves a doomed airliner i highly recommend it 
this could have been a sloppy john goodmans character approach to a severe drug and alcohol problem washington made it an epiphany and we are all the better for it the opening scene with the flight attendant should not be seen by anyone under but it was necessary to the understanding of the court scene where he has that epiphany
good from bad with ultimate resolution keeps your attention and creates both a feeling of sympathy while condemning bad behavior 
one of the best actors ever denzel washington delivers another amazing performance if you havent seen the trailer this movie is not what you think it is one of the best movies to come out in quite some time
really enjoyed this movie gripping story denzel washington reliable as ever picture and sound excellent sound in blu ray highly recommended 
i saw this in the theater and liked it a lot seeing it again at home being able to stop rewind etc i like it even more i think denzels acting is superb he should have won the oscar and the story evokes a hundred different emotions one of the best movies ive seen in the past ten years 
a great human drama of a man and the demons in a bottle denzel really plays the part well and tho he does have problems to overcome he comes through a hero of sorts 
excellent movie excellent acting and a very good story line i enjoyed it and kept my interest right up to the end 
very good movie very intense and most likely true in some aspects i like denzel washington and glad he finally had a good role in a movie 
what can i say denzels performance is nothing short of amazing talk about a flawed human being with all of his wounds out on display this will be one you wont soon forget and john goodman is pretty fantastic too great story lots of complexity and a really interesting take on addiction well worth the time you will put into it 
denzel was amazing in this movie the acting was stellar i didnt know what to expect from the previews but when i sat and watched it it took off 
denzell washington was able to take an otherwise semi mediocre script and create a masterpiece his depiction of an extremely skilled but troubled airline pilot deserves an academy award he reminds me of dustin hoffman in the original midnight cowboy or gena rowlands in a woman under the influence he has the extraordinary ability to make the character entire believable and demonstrate as if he is the actual person the downward spiral that this skilled pilot experienced the final scenes involve his reconciliation and with gods help the revelation to himself and to others that he was an alcoholic a must see for film noir fans and for action film buffs also 
moments make heroes not lifetimes and denzel washingtons performance of whip whitaker in flight proves that while whip may be a great pilot hes a human being with a lot of problems that take up as much room in his life as his heroism washingtons whitaker is a pilot who we seem from the outset has a lot of problems in his life an ex wife a drinking problem and a bit of cocaine habit which all might not be so bad if he werent an airline pilot about to board a flight hes piloting the flight starts off rocky whitaker takes off through a rainstorm and powers through it to clear air with a bit of lying to the control tower about what hes doing the rest of the flight is uneventful until the plane starts to malfunction and to save the plane he flies it inverted before flip it back and landing in a field with only minimal deaths onboard the rest of the movie deals with how whitaker deals with his problems and his addictions as its discovered that he was drunk at the time of the crash and the ntsb hearing looms ever closer and jail time is the outcome if hes found negligent washington has one of his best performances in flight its a low key and understated performance and most of it is realized in whitakers attitude as he moves through the ordeal from a confident and cocky pilot to a man worried about his future and he tries to influence the testimony of the crew on the airplane margaret tamara tunie and his co pilot brian gerahty john goodman puts in a flamboyant performance as whitakers on call drug dealer and he almost steals the show with a performance that should be over the top but isnt kelly reilly has a great role as nicole a heroin addict who moves in with whitaker but cant take his addictions and denial the songs played on the soundtrack are kind of an obvious telegraphing whats going on but one intriguing aspect was the heartbeat played at appropriate moments flight is the kind of movie made to highlight good performances everything from the special effects to the acting to serves to make a poignant and powerful film 
an overall excellent film denzel washington accurately and realistically portrays an addict who happens to be an airline pilot well done a most enjoyable entertainment experience 
loved it its actually very informative give it to a family member that has an addiction issue and dont tell them about it the movie is exciting in the beginning but then becomes apparent that it is about addiction im very sure this goes on in real life a must see movie enjoyed watching it anything denzel washington is in i order 
this was definitely not the movie i thought it was going to be but it was a fantastic movie i really enjoyed it though at times it was difficult to watch denzel washington is an incredible actor and after seeing this movie i realized why he looked disappointed not to get the oscar he was amazing great movie great story great acting by all involved 
this is a great movie with a realistic depiction of alcoholism and treatment denzel gives an oscar worthy performance goodman is hysterical as the drug dealer and very realistic as well lots of attention to the little details that make this a fuller picture of real life experiences instead of just dialogue telling you what is going on highly recommended 
was a very good movie as most of denzel washingtons movies are will enjoy watching this one again and again priced right also 
well what can i say about denzel he is the greatest african american actor of our generation hes like our sidney portia loved the story line i am sure this is very up close personal for a lot of pilots great movie anyone in the aviation industry would enjoy this 
excellent movie all around amazing performance by denzel washington as well as all the other actors like others i didnt know what to expect from this movie didnt read the reviews i came away from the movie feeling and thinking differently and i quite like that as a recovering alcoholic i was truly amazed that a movie could capture the feeling of the absolute trap that alcohol is there are other movies that straddle the same storyline but this was deeply moving and in the end inspiring in the way that religion love and forgiveness can make all the difference in the world the scene in the hotel room near the end is priceless and every alcoholic knows that quiet knock that barely perceptible call that alerts us that there is alcohol somewhere close this scene may seem hard to believe for others but believe me it is very real everything wrapped up nicely when denzels character was in the courtroom at the end i was truly surprised by the choice he made very powerful movie 
first off whats not to like about denzel he is a superb actor in his own right that said the story line of this movie was exceptional it gave you a brief glimpse into the life of an alcoholic and many of the issues that are associated with this very real disease this statement is kind of a spoiler alert but what was the most striking scene in the movie for me was the one where the character is looking at the nips in the fridge hes made up his mind not to drink anymore hes serious hes not playing this time everything is riding on this pivotal moment and then the demon takes over hes helpless to resist it and so he gives himself over to it and the fall of it was great addiction is exactly like that people often wonder why dont they just quit but what they dont understand is it is not as easy as that there is something that goes on in the chemistry of the brain that the addict is helpless against without the necessary resources and unwavering support thats why they say one day at a time this was a great movie 
my son who has been in recovery for months absolutely related to this movie he showed it to his other friends in recovery great movie very emotional to anyone who has been affected by addiction
this movie was amazing kept me on the edge of my seat and the human aspect is amazing recommend watching
the special effects are just excellent and take your breath away in this well told story that has a surprising cast that hold the whole thing together tightly this is a great denzel movie 
i loved this movie and think its one of washingtons best performances truthfully i think its one of the best acting performances ive ever seen the movie is a psychological thriller with moral overtones on the other hand its a story about alcoholism and the capacity for human rationalization ie denial some found the ending trite i thought it was perfect 
this is one of my favorite movies denzel deserves an academy award for this one his portrayal of an alcoholic is riveting and utterly credible the viewer will also get an accurate glimpse of the corruption and harm that inevitably result from the government industry complex where bureaucrats and politicians decide who will be allowed to succeed ultimately the movie is about the triumph of ethics and morality and heroes who are willing to speak truth to mindless ideology 
the whole movie was great denzel is always great in any role this one was no exception i would tell anyone it is worth watching 
one hell of a film the flight itself kept you on your toes denzil played the part so well highly recommend for everyone to see this film 
the flow of events was wisely planed starting from few hours prior to taking off with a pilot intoxicated with drugs liquor wasted in a hotel room with a hooker burdened with his troubled son and scattered family that setting evolved into the sequence of events that led to the airplane crash in which the intoxicated pilot reacted with outstanding ingenuity to overcome inevitable dive crashing to the ground by rolling his airplane in order to regain lift the very intense moments of taking off in very severe weather conditions left me thinking on whether such aggressive handling of the airplane would result in potential damage to the elevator flaps of the airplane even though captain whitaker managed to rise above the clouds level the airplane with apparently charismatic and heroic endeavors it would remain ultimately unknown whether such rough handling of the airplane would have precipitated the subsequent failure the very few intense minutes from getting into a downward dive rolling and undoing the rolling to the final crash landing were very educational dramatic and charging the imagination of the viewer till the very end of the movie the captain succeeded very will in announcing every step in his procedure to escape death and save lives with impeccable coordination of his copilot and fight assistant the legal drama that followed the crash was also engaging reasonable and educational as the legal team managed to suppress legal evidence of intoxication and the pilot started patching his life to deal with drug addiction his broken family attempting to start another while being treated forensic evidence made a twist of fate when the pilot had to explain the presence of two bottle of vodka in the cockpit disposal the world of drugs and prostitution where the pilot relied upon as a support social net to keep mental calm would gradually collapse over his fate leading him to prison the one last lie which captain whitaker resisted making extricated him from the gloom and loss of intoxication the end of the movie was also appropriate with a cleaned up sober prisoner gaining strength and lively outlook attending to writing and reading instead of inhaling drinking smoking and fooling with strangers responding to a visit from his son who has resented his father for leading irresponsible lifestyle the federal hearing and testimony of the pilot was also educational harsh and methodical well done mohamed d el hewie
love it denzel washington does a great job enjoyed the story line and held my attention i would buy it again
there arent enough words to describe denzel is the man what an incredible performance if you do anything you need to watch this movie 
this is a truly amazingly well acted movie by denzel and the entire cast how true this might be is not my place to discuss as this is just a commentary on the movie a truly real topic and it just shows that no matter how right you were in the time of crisis even saving hundreds of lives in the process you can still be very wrong as well that is the focus of this movie the humanity of denzels characters situation he did an amazing job staying calm and never panicking like the co pilot his level of experience and gut instinct about all aspects of how an aircraft works the physics of aerodynamics etc these skills he possessed saved nearly all of the lives on his flight but he was totally wrong at the core very moving and something really to think about not only regarding pilots but all professionals in charge with the care of safety of other peoples lives like a surgeon policeman and our government if you wish to expand this movies concept beyond just one person to an entire body of people charged with the same mandate 
very good movie which depicts an alcoholics faulty reasoning and actions even though he is a hero as only denzel can do so well it was a bit rough to see him be wrong and then to admit it was hard but a great lesson for everyone 
this movie was much much more than i expected it to be while the flight itself was nerve wracking and nail biting goodness the aftermath was the emotional heart of the movie the actors directors writers did a wonderful job of making you care about the characters and drawing you into their lives i cheered and hoped and cried excellent 
washington was great as was the supporting cast very good movie i was surprised at the ending which is refreshing i would recommend it to others 
a great movie denzel did a good job portraying his character movie started strong in the beginning then had a bit of a lull then went back to interesting lol
i heard that it was good but was surprised that it was really really good special effects were awesome and the story line was totally believeable denzel washington was surpurb definitely star 
what a nice surprise flight was i had no idea it was about denzel playing an alcoholic the movie starts with a dramatic plane sequence then turns to the aftermath of the situation with denzels character and his actions that day the director robert z crafts a beautiful story here every scene seemed to grow more intense as the movie played out ending with a very emotional end this isnt an action flick like those stated above so be prepared for an emotional and dramatic tale don cheadle delivered a great performance also as well as the supporting cast i must say i was on the edge of my seat in the last few minutes unsure how it would play out superb movie all around 
this is a powerful movie about a man you to want to loves struggle with alcoholism he just happened to be in a plane crash this is not a courtroom drama not an action flick the plane crash happens in the first min of the movie and lasts maybe minutes tops after that all drama the movie starts out with an epic plane crash scene one of the best ive ever seen in a movie denzels character takes control of the plane like a pro with every ounce of drug and alcohol seemingly vaporized from his system and his instincts as an ex navy fighter pilot take over the movie is great in it has you rooting for this guy throughout but he keeps letting you down as the viewer as well as all of the characters in his life you saw how awesome this guy was in the cockpit he was a hero yet he cannot overcome this addiction how can a man who could do such extraordinary things be so vulnerable to addiction the movie does this part very well the most powerful scene emotionally comes at the end during the ntsb hearing and the scenes that follow i will admit until i gauged what the film was really about i was kind of meh about it but by the end i fully understood and appreciated it for what it was powerful movie indeed 
i am not a movie buff but was formerly in aviation and i now work with those in crisis in social work literacy i was astounded by how not formulaic this film was i usually will shy away from flying movies or anything about addiction due to my lifetime vocational saturation i was drawn to this film because denzel has so few vehicles for his incredible talent this did not disappoint and the theme sat fine with me it was dealt with so well and with the kind of humor that comes only from a full appreciation of the absurdity of life i am very glad i took the rare time to see this the story will stick with me in the same ilk as films like crash such writing that depicts men with truth in all their soulful humanness there are just too few in any medium five stars for denzel speechless 
i dont know anybody who thought this wasnt worth the price of buying renting or watching my whole family loved it 
in my opinion denzel washington ages like a fine wine and the roles he chooses to play at this stage of his career are projects with so much depth beneath the surface flight takes us on a ride that turns out to be so much more than the films trailer the pairing of washington and don cheadle once again alone is worth the price of admission to this well acted character study and john goodman is so versatile that he is well placed in any excellent film and usally is my denzel dvd collection is growing and theres not a rotten tomato in the bunch 
i loved this and the surprise ending it kept me guessing throughout the entire movie i will never look at another plane ride the same again 
we are all possible vicitms of genetic disorders including alcohlolism which this movie prooves does not exclude the fact that you may be awesome in other areas but this has to be taken care of for your life and the lives of those you love to be lived 
after a slow and somewhat rocky start this movie proceeds to develop the complex character of whip whitaker an excellent pilot a man calm under pressure and an alcoholic probably the most compelling moment is when whitaker decides to change his life a good resurrection movie for easter sunday 
denzel washington did a great job in flight i have watched over and over again the sound effects were great 
director robert zemeckis finest work in years a compelling unpredictable addiction drama bolstered by denzel washingtons career high performance as airline pilot whip whitaker the oscar winning actor never strikes a false note in his complex portrayal john gatins intelligent script evades clich eacute and the supporting cast remains exemplary flight is the kind of mature filmmaking rarely seen in todays hollywood by all means avoid the ridiculously misleading trailer 
i thought this film succeeded on all levels very suspenseful at times top notch acting lots of drama and flawless special effects i cant say that about the last few efforts of denzel i have been a fan of his since glory but to me this was a big come back for him 
first let me say that denzel is one of my all time favorite actors i have been enjoying his work every since st elsewhere very seldom have i been disappointed by his movies that said when i started watching flight i was not so sure i made a good choice i kept watching and i have to say i grew to love it the story information may be hard to watch for some but it rings very true because i remember the days when some pilots used to drink all the time in the various lounges in the airports i traveled through as a matter of fact i met quite a few pilots back in the day and shared a few drinks with them to settle my fear of flying nerves these days though i am glad that the airline industry is doing a better job of helping pilots with their possible addictions denzel portrayed a very likable but flawed human being who just happened to be a pilot john goodman is funny enabling friend and don cheadle plays a great lawyer trying to save denzels character tamara tunie is a great stewardess friend too dont want to give away too much but this one is a keeper and good addition to my denzel collection see for yourself dont want
i started watching this movie with no information as to what the plot was about i just knew it had to do with a plane crash and i was thinking it was an action movie or something like that to my surprise this is not at all what this is about the accident is the catalyst for a wonderful story to come this is about a mans battle with his addiction and how this affected his life the way in which the situation is presented is clever and thought provoking the reason i am saying that is because whip a pilot that is an alcoholic and drug user is in charge of a flight when things go wrong with the plane even though whip was inebriated he performed a series of miraculous maneuvers and landed the plane saving most of the passengers almost no one could have prevented everyone from dying but now comes the question even if the fault was mechanical is the fact that whip was fulfilling his duties in that state criminal behavior the moments after the crash get a little slow but the intensity of the movie soon picks up denzel washington delivers an amazing performance and we completely believe he is drunk high when we see him on screen the many relationships denzels has in the plot provide this story with multiple layer of complexity and we end up feeling like we watched a masterpiece this is not a movie to watch if you are looking for some light entertainment or for a relaxing have a good time type of film but if you are looking for a compelling story that will make you think and that provide drama at the highest level this is it 
quite different than i expected but still thrilling loved it could easily watch it again and enjoy it great with popcorn 
this movie is a great movie amazing acting a lot of drug and alcohol use in the movies so i would not allow a child to watch it but great storyline and just an all around impressive movie
a charismatic expert pilot averts a near disaster and afterward deals with personal professional hazards i was electrified by both i could watch it over and over just because it was so believable for me i applaud the story writer and the music director 
denzel washington is a wonderful actor and this performance is no less than excellent john goodman was fantastic in his character role very good surprising twists in the story line just a really good movie for movie buffs 
as a recovering alcoholic i relived a lot of misery guilt and shame the river of denial is hard to cross we do many things even some good things while drinking but usually for the wrong reasons steve s 
this was a hard movie to watch but well worth the watch it was not relaxing but a powerful drama i like denzel washington as an actor in other movies so i guessed that i would like this one i was not disappointed in any way 
denzel washington did yet another perfect job this movie had me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning i highly recommend watching this the action at the beginning is amazing and the unfolding of the pilots life comes out and has you wondering what will happen next i thought this was fantastic 
director robert zemeckis has given us the latest disaster movie in the case of flight however zemeckis first live action film since s cast away this is less the die hard kind of disaster and more the leaving las vegas type zemeckis is a well known director whose films have peppered the pop culture lexicon for the past years he is a pioneer who took marty mcfly back to the future taught forrest to run in forrest gump and broke new ground in live action animation film making with films like who framed roger rabbit beowulf the polar express and a christmas carol this year zemeckis showcases his craft with a strong character study of a disturbed pilot in flight the intensity and effectiveness of flight rests on the shoulders of its star denzel washington and it turns out denzel washington has some pretty strong shoulders washington dives head first into the character of pilot whip whitaker a classic pilot name whitaker is a closeted addict shrouded in denial he routinely drinks to excess and uses stimulants to even out before flights his lifestyle has cost him virtually any relationship or contact with his wife and son and has led him down the path of womanizing and heavy substance abuse as a desperate form of distraction flight sets out to tell a story of moral ambiguity its protagonist is one who tests the ethical boundaries of the audience where at one moment we are rooting for him and the next we are disgusted by him this ambiguity fuels the pace and power of the film and makes its minute running time literally fly by washington is excellent but zemeckis is precise in his style editing and yes pam and eric in his cinematography washington makes us see whitakers struggle but zemeckis makes us feel it with expert use of camera movements showing us a static sober whitaker and a flowing frantic intoxicated whitaker the crash sequence is compelling and exceeds expectations regardless of its assumed predictability these nuanced touches make flight deeply engaging and provide for some harrowingly primal audience reaction furthermore washingtons stellar performance is complemented at every turn with a pitch perfect supporting cast including don cheadle bruce greenwood melissa leo and john goodman who is for with electric supporting roles this year with flight and argo while the performances and the story are excellent flight does not accomplish all it is trying to do a motif of religious purpose and providence feels crow barred in also while excellent the soundtrack is a bit heavy handed in its relevance to whats happening on the screen which can be distracting however these are minor quibbles overall flight is an excellent narrative that explores the dangers of addiction in an impressively unique way this is a strong film that expertly demonstrates the talent of its cast and director a read more reviews at 
flight is film that belongs in the airplane disaster genre of films in a nutshell a senior level airplane pilot has a severe and chronic problem with alcohol recreational drugs and hookers during a routine flight the plane experiences a mechanical problem which prevents the tail rudder from functioning and the plane spontaneously dives into a crash mode fortunately the pilot is able to rescue the plane by flying it upside down releases excess fuel into the atmosphere and skillfully lands it in a grassy field most of the film is spent disclosing the pilots indulgences in alcohol cocaine and other sleazy behaviors the entire film is a journey to a destination that takes the form of a plus minus choices an example of the plus minus choices are should the pilot be held responsible for the crash and for the few passenger deaths because of his unique alcoholism and recreational drug activities with the consequent loss of control of the craft or should the pilot be lauded as a hero because of his astonishing skill in maintaining control of the airplane during the mechanical failure and because of the fact that he prevented the deaths of dozens of passengers the surprise ending is that the destination of the movie is located in a legal gray area dont worry i do not tell how the story ends technical aspects the technical aspect of the film is based on a real event namely alaska airlines flight in flight a mcdonnell douglas md aircraft experienced a fatal accident on january over the pacific ocean about miles north of anacapa island california the two pilots and passengers on board were killed the national transportation safety board determined that the cause was a loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system screw assemblys acme nut threads towards the end of the movie flight the viewing audience watches a federal inquest as to the causes of the crash and the viewing audience learns that the failure was due to excess wearing of the same screw assembly opening moments the opening moments of the movie will come as a surprise the viewer will be treated to an abundance of mammary footage and gluteal footage of denzel washingtons drug addict girlfriend i was wondering if we were going to see naked footage of mr washington but fortunately the viewer is spared in the opening minutes we also see mr washington snorting cocaine we see bag of marijuana and we see the girlfriend injecting heroin now the question that arises is whether adult viewers will have a stomach for this sort of thing certainly male viewers will welcome the excellent anatomy of the female actress however the nude scenes and the drug scenes seemed to me to be x rated material at any rate this is the only nudity that occurs in the film and the nudity is similar to that shown in kramer versus kramer when we see dustin hoffmans girlfriend it is my opinion that the material is suitable for children but only for the age of and over younger kids will likely respond with bad dreams in my opinion this film is an excellent teaching device for kids of the age of and up since it provides a case history of alcoholism and addiction the film does not include any sam pekinpah style violence however parents who have made up their minds that their children should not see nude scenes and should not be exposed to scenes of alcoholism and drugs should refrain from buying the dvd tenor of the film the film provides a guided tour of some of the gray areas of life during the flight the young copilot is alarmed by mr washingtons bizarre activities in the cockpit e g his behavior in pretending that the oxygen mask is a recreational drug that is to be inhaled and so the viewing audience is given the choice of siding with the naive young copilot or of not making any committed decision at this point while on the ground mr washington tries to become reacquainted with his son who lives with the divorced mother and who is totally alienated from his father and so the viewing audience is given the choice of siding with the sons decision to cut of ties with the father or to favor mr washingtons attempts at reconciliation as the plot matures mr washingtons girlfriend takes him to an alcoholics anonymous aa meeting but mr washington resists the hackneyed preaching of the meeting leader and excuses himself from the meeting and so the viewing audience is given the choice of deciding that mr washington is a lost cause as far as his alcoholism is concerned or of maintaining some belief that mr washington will be able to reform himself eventually for your information it is the case that up to the very last minutes of the film mr washington continues to snort cocaine and to drink hard liquor another gray area is that blood samples were withdrawn from the entire crew and passengers as well as from the dead crash victims the result was that mr washingtons blood tested positive for cocaine and alcohol the relevant gray areas or sources of ambiguity are as follows the equipment from the clinical testing laboratory was not calibrated thereby leading to doubt of the validity of the lab results and leading to the airlines officials successful sealing mr washingtons laboratory results thereby preventing the positive results from being disclosed during the federal inquest the gray area is therefore were the lab results really incorrect or were they valid in showing mr washingtons high alcohol and drug levels special effects the crash landing scene is a work of art after flying the airplane upside down for several minutes mr washington rights the airplane approaches a grassy meadow one of the wingtips slices through a church steeple causing parishioners to scatter and we see the plane twisting and buckling as it lands in the field in a dramatic manner that recalls the drama of the whaling scenes in moby dick starring gregory peck another special effect though a low tech special effect occurs when mr washington is in a hotel room at night waiting to meet government officials the next day during the night the door to the next suite accidently left unlocked invitingly bangs against the door latch due to the evening wind puffing into the adjoining hotel suite mr washington rises walks through the door to the next suite and stands before the open window this is a great suspensful moment achieved with zero expense aside from the need for one of the film crew to jar the door a few times thus simulating the wind the suspense of this scene continues when mr washington spots the hotel fridge and opens it revealing dozens of bottles of liquor and beer mr washington takes out one of the liquor bottles and the movie camera focuses upon it closely and the inch high liquor bottle takes up the entire screen suspense comes because the audience will wonder if mr washington will open the bottle or if he will resist to temptation and decidedly turn a new leaf before his meeting the next day with airline officials who are investigating the crash conclusion the film is one of the most intelligent films to come out of hollywood the film is similar to another movie starring denzel washington namely crimson tide crimson tide also featured a government inquest this one involving a submarine and the issue of firing nuclear weapons the journey of this movie navigates through the black and white territory involving the question of who behaved correctly denzel washington or gene hackman but unexpectedly at the last moment the plot line of crimson tide takes an unexpected turn and navigates away from the black and white area and concludes in a harbor known as the gray area flight also takes a similar unexpected turn at the conclusion of the film five stars 
this movie was very interesting to see another perspective on denzel washingtons character who became an alcoholic and drug addict i liked how his new girlfriend who he met wanted him to go to rehab to stop his addiction and chose not to join him on his trip to jamacia 
the denzel washington character had me completely fooled i thought his character was about a jock saving an aircraft it was about saving himself from himself while on the ground his character blew me away very provoking 
i had seen the commercials for this movie on tv and though it looked like a movie i might enjoy and i did the movie kept me intrigued and on edge to find out what really happened and what was going to happen next was surprised by the ending and would recommend this to friends to watch 
what a fairy tale what a bunch of wonderful characters i loved songs as well i found it incredibly beautiful and for some reason reminds me a lot of russian old fairy tales they are exceptional in my opinion and this is just as great maybe because it has some similarities i love it i just love it and i love how true love is depicted here and how full of cheer laughter and life the sisters are in real life at this time its something extinct 
had to have the d version and found out that you can get region free d version on amazon co uki decided to take my chances on the european version luck should have it that it as well is region free and plays just fine on a us only bluray player i bought the eu version for language choices it with in german dts english dts italian dts and turkish dts it asks right that the begging which language to play in before it goes to d mode or any previews 
probably the best disney musical since mulan i loved the musical numbers the characters and the plot the snowman was adorable and a cute touch this is a movie for all ages so watch it even if you do not have little ones 
i enjoyed frozen im a fan of kristen bell and the rest of the voice actors were fantastic as well this film has fun songs engaging characters and an interesting plot i liked how the film focused on the relationship between the sisters this isnt my most favorite disney animation but its certainly worth the watch 
this is a sweet story that is easy for a little child to follow they all love the music they love the jokes and they love the characters the only downside to owning the movie is that you will be constantly asked to play it for the little disney fans in your house considering that in a few years youll be trying to steer them away from reality shows rap music and aspiring to be a kardashian that really isnt such a bad thing enjoy the fact that theyll watch it with you and smile and sing and be happy over something sweet for as long as it lasts 
lets face it im really over the let it go song just let it go however the animation was absolutely beautiful i watched this movie with my small people and they were absolutely blown away i also discovered some of the adults in the room standing around and watching as well smile it is an awesome movie and now a part of my movie library 
my grandson loves the musical score and he was recovering from a stomach bug so it was perfect to have something he enjoyed and we could sit and cuddle up and watch with him 
while there are a couple of incidents of loss or tragedy we should remember that many disney dreamworks and various other family films have done the same its part of life and kids already kinda know that my daughter was sad when the parents died at the beginning but lets think snow white mom dies dad is tricked into marrying an abusive woman who tries to kill snow in the wizard of oz dorothy no longer has her parents she has an initially resentful relationship with her family she also must witness death multiple times one of those being when she kills the witch cinderella mom dies dad marries abusive woman then dad dies hansel gretel can you imagine the trauma of having your father marry a terrible woman who convinces him to leave you in the woods then a cannibalistic witch traps you makes one of you a servant and plans to eat the other then you must shove her in an over in order to kill her escape epic mom takes you and leaves job focused dad but then she dies you have to go back to dad lion king do i really need to go here i still cry toy story no dad and toys think they have been forgotten by the person who they love most look back at toy story jesses story hotel transylvania mom is killed in a fire set by humans princess the frog they live in the slums of new orleans outskirts dad works himself to the bone dies while away at war then teenage girl must support the family meet the robinsons adoption repeated flashes feelings of rejection because his mom gave him up and do i even need to say anything about up good grief i was traumatized by that my point being yes there are some real life esque moments but all of them are tastefully done and actually started a really good talk between me my kids girl age boy age about death and losing people pets we love the real beauty about this is an element that was somewhat rejected in brave young women do not need to be saved by a man or brought back to life or define themselves through a man while anna is quite naively smitten through the story she learns from it and she learns what real love is a self less act that does not need to be between a man woman or romantic and the sidekicks omg hilarious i almost peed myself when olaf sings about his great wish for summertime anna kristoff are a lot of fun and sven the reindeer is very funny now elsa talk about someone who has put the world on their shoulders and pushed the people she loves away for fear of hurting them annas do you want to build a snowman she is one tortured soul but her let it go power ballad will give you chills the animation is lovely the setting unique the characters are very dimensional and they learn and grow as they go and the story telling has twists you would never expect from disney and best of all for all of us adults it has some fun and thoughtful things for us too really dont miss out on this one its a gem 
winter scenery provides a resplendent background for this very entertaining story i cannot improve on many of the other reviews provided here i was however dismayed when i realized that the initial release was not offered in d after a little research i learned that it was being released internationally in the d format but not here in the states you can thwart this avaricious move though by ordering your copy from amazon uk for about pounds the uk version is listed as region free so i assume it will work here 
my daughter loves this movie just like every little girl i imagine and sings the songs all the time the show has a great story and isnt too annoying to watch as a parent 
this movie is a true phenomenon for some reason kids all kids absolutely love it both my kids and my niece and nephew know all the songs 
my five year old only makes me watch it x a week good movie for the entire family except for my husband whos seen it one to many times and can probably never watch it again prepare for your kids to break into let it go at any given moment or act out do you wanna build a snowman in the hallway at on a saturday morning 
as a father its pretty much a given that youre going to start inadvertently memorizing all disney movies and characters luckily for me i dont mind disney films in fact im quite damn fond of em especially the way disney makes them now whereasbravecentered around mothers and daughters disneys latest frozen is about sisters based on hans christian andersens tale the snow queen disneys adaptation is about sisters elsa idina menzel and anna kristen bell who grow up close at first but after an accident become estranged when elsa ends up placing her kingdom in eternal winter it is up to little sister anna to seek her out and try and get elsa to stop the curse what is so beautiful about this story is the many metaphors racing throughout the story elsas talent is representative of anyone who is different and the love in the film is a love that is more important than some romantic true loves kiss kind of love its unconditional love with films such asup single disc edition wreck it ralph wall e single disc edition tangled toy story brave and frozen disney has proven that they are no longer merely a movie producer of kids movies their stories are some of the most heartfelt well written and plotted ive seen in recent years 
the boys and sing along just as much as the girls ages and heck cant get the year old neighbor to stop singing do you want to build a snowman and hes not know for his friendliness 
and this will teach us all not to judge a book by its cover ever again when the trailer for frozen was dropped a few months back i predicted a dud it looked so generic and obvious and unfunny and repetitive and just everything i didn t want it to be when news of the film broke i was ecstatic disney doing another musical basing it off of a very dark and disturbing tale i knew it would get white washed a bit which i was fine with but it was a musical and so i was automatically game for it then that trailer deceived me still my daughters were hooked with the very first television spot and they ve had the dolls for nearly a month already and so we were going to see this opening night with expectations low despite some good early ink there was nowhere to go but up for this film and it didn t just go up it blew through the roof yes frozen is easily disney s best film since beauty and the beast and honestly one of the best musicals since it s a visual feast charming and sincere and an unexpected twist on a tale of love family and acceptance with beautiful shades that make this something truly special the film tells the story of two sisters anna and elsa in early childhood they are joined at the hip elsa has an ancient power to create ice a power that is never explained and quite frankly doesn t need to be and they use her power as an advantage to their playing when an accident occurs and anna is injured elsa becomes terrified of her gift and basically locks herself away from everyone and everything including anna the two obviously drift apart do you want to build a snowman is a marvelous musical moment and brought tears to my eyes and after the loss of their parents things only get worse now fully grown anna is a nave and desperate young woman seeking any attention she can get and elsa is distant and misunderstood on the night of elsa coronation things go amuck and her secret is exposed to disastrous consequences and soon elsa is forced to flee and anna is left to track her down and thaw her town now many have balked before seeing the film that anna is reduced to yet another disney stereotype a girl who needs a man to get the job done ignorance is bliss i suppose but frozen certainly takes a different approach that the one expected and presents us with a lovable tomboy a klutz who takes risks and places faith and is willing to take the bull by the horns even when its beyond her reach sure she is aided by a man but she doesn t need him around and even the twist at the end where it could have easily fallen into stereotype of man saves the day turns out to be even more sincere and honest in the way it finally comes out anna is a great role model for young girls and surprisingly so is elsa and the beautiful bond created by disney here is unlike anything i ve seen them do before yes while the film does eventually give is an antagonist albeit ever so briefly and the way the villain is handled is light and a very nice change of pace the beauty of frozen is that the chief antagonist is not a singular person but the inner struggle to be accepted and understood elsa is not a monster she is simply scared or herself and what she may do to those whom she loves frozen does a marvelous job of portraying the bond between sisters and the lengths each will go to protect and love the other my daughter was in tears over their separation that is how heartfelt this portrayal is frozen in my eyes is one of the best things disney has done ever the film is a modern day classic and one that is sure to be remembered and regarded as a beloved nod to the disney renaissance with obvious modern twists and its own identity i m not exaggerating when i say that i can see this being spoken of in the same circles as beauty and the beast cinderella and the little mermaid while tangled certainly helped disney regain their footing after some serious dips in quality frozen completely redeems them and proves that they are still as magical as they ever were take that pixar and let s just talk about the musical angle for just a moment this is one of those rare gifts that actually feel like a true broadway show the use of music is integral to the feel of the story and the glorious visual expanse helps create an epic and larger than life reality when elsa has her big number let it go is one of the greatest disney ballads of all time easily you can feel the goose bumps and your heart starts beating faster this is a beautifully nostalgic reminder of the power of disney and it helps bring those same chills and thrills to a new and younger generation i have never seen my daughter so excited to be watching a film as i saw her while watching frozen it carries a different feeling 
i wanted to see this in the theatre but never had the time i finally got to watch it and was not disappointed it deserves all the acclaim and allocades and more the kingdom of arrendale has two princesses anna the younger and elsa the older elsa also has an ability to create ice and snow which during a night of play accidentally hurts anna this causes her and her parents to fear her ability despite the wise trolls advice and to seal her away but when the parents die elsa becomes queen and on the night of the coronation her ability comes out during an argument with her sister now anna must figure out how to bring elsa back and free their home from the frozen state it is in this movie reminds me of the old days of aladdin lion king and beauty and the beast two of those won best picture before the acadamy made an animated category songs both serious and goofy are throughout the movie and appropriate for the moments they come out characters were well done from the enthusiastic anna to the quiet kristoff to the comedy relief of sven the reindeer and olaf the villian was not the one you expect and honestly got off easy in my opinion overall it is a great movie deserving a place in any library and honestly should have won the best picture award instead of what did win 
our children has watched it so many times they know the script and every song one of the best investment i made 
it has been a while since i wrote a review not much time for writning reviews lately but when i saw frozen i felt my review writing fingers starting to itch but i was surprised when i got on amazon and saw so many reviews already normally it takes a while before the movie becomes available on dvd blu ray maybe we saw it late we saw it jan rd i guess quite late with so many reviews whats left to say well heres my cts theres not much i was going to say anyway other then as i was watching in the theater about mins in the showing i thought oscar yeap i know its kind a lame now cause the nominations are alreaddy out and yes frozen has been nominated i was to write and publish this review prior to any news on the oscar just to mention that i was thinking oscar for frozen i didnt realize the nominations would be announced already i dont really follow it anyway it still just nominations so all is not lost yet im pretty sure frozen is going to be the winner for best animated feature im also pretty sure this is goign to be a new classic for disney really really really good a must see beautiful funny musical 
frozen is fabulous and enjoyable this film is for any and every age as a voice teacher creator of voice lessons to go i am teaching these songs daily repeatedly in my music studio everyone wants to sing this music little kids are swept up into the characters and for adults there is such fabulous humour in the character of olaf i also am extremely impressed with the strength the women charecters both have they do not need men to survive which is a nice change from past disney films rather they find strength in themselves a much better message for our girls 
the movie is full of fun the main story is between sisters and they are not evil step sisters but loving sisters family is something the movie seems to focus on another concept in almost every disney movie is true love it is the one concept every disney lover looks for i loved the surprises and story that disney came up for the movie the actors captivated the audience and brought the characters to life with humor and the sweetness of their voices having the two disc and digital copy gave me more chances to share the movie with family and friends i was able to watch this movie four times so far and will watch it some more i am looking forward to what else disney has to offer after watching this movie i would recommend the movie to any fan of true love and of unexpected fairy tales 
this movie has a good message and elements that are different and creative from other childrens movies these days i have high expectations for childrens movies and think that most of them are a disappointment usually there is a great deal of attitude violence and inappropriateness not the case with this one there may be more violence than i approve of but there is so much that is truly enjoyable this movie has a heart humor beauty and good music i would only like the punch removed from one of the last scenes other than that dont miss this movie well done 
frozen is a joyous movie that is the most wonderful depiction of genuine self sacrificial love in a movie i have ever seen many other reviews have touched on the movies plot details i will only say that the plot is refreshingly original for a kids movie although many adults could use the lesson this movie teaches i saw it three times in the theater the first time i was prepared to dislike it because it was a musical and before this movie i didnt get along with musicals very well this movie changed my attitude by showing me how a really well done series of songs combined with an illustration of a profound moral ethical principle doesnt just create a movie it creates a powerful emotional experience to draw upon in my own life and the lives of everyone else that watches it especially children great job disney thanks for buying pixar one of the best decisions you ever made 
highly anticipated by my grand daughters it arrived the day it came out they ripped open the package and have watched it many times since then they have all the songs memorized already i know your children and you too will love this movie another disney classic go on get it 
i have three daughters currently and they loved frozen in the movie theater my three year old still talks about how the movie made her cry but not in a sad way as a dad who frequently has to sit through the kids movies i thought it was really good too good story and music easy for the kids to follow not too long and the older kids enjoyed it as much as the youngest i personally enjoyed olaf the snowman and his song about the summer i was expecting the typical disney movie and in a lot of ways it was but this one is probably a little better than average 
you can read a review of this move anywhere and i expect you have already done just that that being said i was a frozen hater for pretty much the duration of the theater run time of this movie there wasnt any part that i hadnt heard about that i liked i hadnt wasted my time going to a theater to see it because i didnt want to waste my time i am a disney fan not a crazy one but i do rely on them to produce entertaining and moving films but i was bitter and turned off from frozen from the get go then it started to grow on me i had been exposed to it so much that i just gave up and tried it out in the theater and loved it thats my review it makes me cry and i love it also since we preordered it from amazon it came to my doorstep the day it came out in pristine packaging my electronic version downloaded without a hitch and the bluray version is gorgeous on my hd tv 
i took my year old daughter to this for her birthday we both loved it for me this is hands down the best movie disney has made as far as animated or digital animation very cute and very funny loved it 
disney may own pixar studios but with tangled and now frozen disney studios is once again making the best animated movies frozen is a fantastic tale about family that pokes fun at some of some of the older disney fare who gets engaged to someone they just met lol the animation is fantastic as are the songs tangled fans watch for the cameo long may elsa reign 
this was one of the best animated movies i have seen in years unlike many animated movies this one will have the adults as entertained as the children 
great movie my kids are obsessed being an s baby the little mermaid will always be my favorite disney movie but this is a close second for me definitely the best one out for this generation of kids i love that the princess isnt a damsel in distress who needs a man what saves the story is the true love between family sisters for once its not the true love kiss from a prince that saves everything great animation realistic backdrop we just love it 
the movie has it all full action great pacing heartwarming unexpected twist and lots of love d was amazing one of my favorites for the oscars cant wait for the dvd 
when i first saw the trailer of this movie i thought its beautiful besides that there is nothing new the plot will be straight forward like any other animation movies for kids how wrong i was unlike other disney animation this film has character development it convincingly and skilfully shows emotion can bring enormous positive or negative consequences i have seen it happened many times in reality it also touchingly demonstrates with family love one can overcome huge obstacles most of the humor is original to me i like the snowman the best he makes me laugh heartily multiple times the animation is first rate the characters faces express emotions such as surprise anger happiness exactly like human beings in one scene anna stands next to a life size drawing my friend said to me anna in the movie and the people in the drawing are not real they are characters drawn by the artists however we can differentiate them we see anna as a real person and the people in the picture are just picture it is amazing the animation is colorful beautiful and realistic too for example it one scene i have the feeling the snow is falling on my face it is wonderful these characteristics make me want to watch it many times the plot has a twist near the end i did not see it coming this makes it different than other animation for family viewers at first i was a little bit disappointed after finding out it was a musical picture i did not like it when the characters sang instead of talking i thought it was not realistic however after minutes i enjoyed it so much that i forgot that it was musical wow so far it has more than reviews on amazon according to boxofficemojo dot com below are the financial figures of this movie as of mar release date november production budget milliondomestic foreign worldwide so far it has made more than billion dollars in just months and days that is incredible it pleases both adults and children that is an astounding achievement in short its the best that my money can get so far in terms of animation movie with character depth family love interesting humor lively and beautiful characters 
usually when a movie is as popular as frozen is i tend to find it overrated in the case of this film i have to bow to the masses it is indeed as good as people are saying its got excellent pacing it uses everything that works with the disney formula and it turns some of the tired clich eacute s these films tend to have on their head the animation is gorgeous the music is catchy appropriate and at times heart wrenching the characters are likeable and the love story teaches kids about what love really is rather than going with the silly romantic clich eacute s that disney usually relies on one aspect of the film that tends to get overlooked is how carefully put together the whole thing is lines that seem to have no deeper meaning at first become meaningful echoes later on even the comedy relief adds to the story and plays into the overarching themes of the film frozen is a movie that kids can enjoy that adults will find entertaining that casual filmgoers will be amused by and that film scholars can analyze in a rewarding manner this is one of those rare times when im completely on board with the movie going public this is a terrific movie 
ive been a fan of the disney princess movies since i was a little girl im glad on the different turn that they took with this sister princesses and the magical aspect of it the non human characters are such a laugh and the music is beautiful if youre a disney and or princess fan i recommend seeing this movie

amazing movie that i believe to be one of disneys best of all time my kids cannot get enough of his movie and neither can my wife or i what disney did right in this was pull together a great mix of both music story characters and so much more if you have never seen this movie you are missing out and should watch this today 
in what is one of the more anticipated disney animated features since tangled the mousy studio has released its remarkable musical frozen starring kristen bell veronica mars idina menzel wicked glee jonathan groff glee and josh gad the book of mormon musical ice age continental drift disneys latest is fresh bold and unique in ways that should be applauded loosely based on hans christian andersens fairy tale the snow queen frozen centers on two princesses elsa idina menzel the soon to be queen and anna kristen bell of the fictional norwegian kingdom of arendelle elsa has the ability to create snow and ice but suppressed these powers after a traumatic childhood incident involving anna after her cryokinetic powers got out of hand during her official july coronation she goes into hiding but her emotions trigger a magical eternal winter that freezes the entire kingdom the arrogant duke of weselton alan tudyk plots to turn everyone against the monster elsa for his own devilish needs lets face it the marketing for this film has been atrocious it has been cryptic to the point of turning folks off of the film the synopsis that i just provided above tells you much more than any trailer theyve released this is too bad because the film is delightful audiences are going to want to compare this to tangled which i think is fair it being the last disney musical in recent memory tangled is a masterpiece that is a high bar to be up against but i think frozen is up to the task therefore the basis of this review will such a comparison first off the music in this true musical there are musical numbers compared to the in tangled is fabulous they employed husband and wife songwriting team robert lopez and kristen anderson lopez to write the songs and they are fantastic im listening to the soundtrack as i write this and it knocks the socks off of tangled in my opinion the vocals are better than tangled as well with both bell and menzel being better singers than mandy moore and the amazing voice acting singing doesnt stop at the leads groff and gad are just as marvelous in their roles this has been called a feminist film which i think is true and not in a bad way it passes the arbitrary bechdel test with flying colors but doesnt try to punch you in the face with any overt feminist messages its just a great movie about two sisters who are trying to navigate their way through the difficult circumstances that they were born to visually the only thing better this year is gravity the d is spectacular although not essential the animation is flawless and stunning where frozen falls short of tangled is in its script the script just isnt as tight and the payoff and climax are not nearly as good tangleds ending was so touching and caused me to tear up a bit where this ending was just plain good and nothing more although the humor is probably a bit better in frozen if only by a hair besides a few script issues frozen will be an instant classic with its music and voices more than making up for its shortcomings i give it a stars i cant recommend it enough 
wonderful storyline i fell in love with this at the movies and me and my daughter and husband now know every line great morals to teach children such as get to know people bond with family and dont be too naive 
disney does it again i swear that disney comes out with the most original movies this is a awesome film i love the story love the music and love the characters olaf and sven steal the show this is just another great disney movie there is one thing you can count on that disney does not make bad movies in my opinion at least and frozen is a good addition if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
im a movie fan i love movies im not overly critical unless a movie is just horrible i pick and choose my genres no horror for me but i love all kinds of movies just to give you a sense of scope some of my favorites are lord of the rings and the hobbit the avengers both thors both captain americas its a wonderful life hoosiers rocky iv and napoleon dynamite i absolutely adore every movie pixar has ever made they are legends in their own time with the exception of brave i own every single pixar movie and watch them regularly ever since when toy story was released ive felt that disney animation has sat in the shadow of pixar theyve tried but nothing has come out that has caught my eye with the exception of tarzan honestly disney animations last golden era was from which saw little mermaid beauty and the beast and the lion king to name a few ushered in the pixar era which has yet to end even some of the competitors have bested disney in recent years despicable me and to be precise that all ends with frozen i saw the teaser for this film last summer when i saw despicable me in the theaters it was the goofy trailer with olaf the snowman and sven the reindeer and i didnt think twice about it figured it would be another disney try and fail attempt when it came out on dvd i heard some stuff about it but nothing really solid that made me say wow i need to see this about a month ago i went to visit a college and over the weekend they had what they called the montys basically the grammys for students of the college there were acts and you could vote for the best so on and so forth one of the acts was a duet performing for the first time in forever one of the guys i was sitting with told me it was from frozen i thought huh that was a good song maybe ill have to watch frozen so for the past few weeks ive been scouring redboxes to find it but it was always checked out finally we found it and i watched it with my family heres what i thought for the first minutes its pretty slow i did not see what all the hype was about yeah the songs were decent but the plot seemed to lack structure and direction after the first minutes or so it really picked up and i was honestly engaged for the rest of the movie when i evaluate a movie i really only look at two things with much intensity and those are the characters and the plot usually a good show by one makes up for rottenness in the other and the greatest movies have great plots and great characters by that count frozen would be one of the greatest movies you have four main characters anna and elsa two girls turned young women who are heirs to the throne of arendelle you also have hans a prince from the southern isles and kristoff a relatively poor loner who sells ice for a living each of these characters are pretty well fleshed out and theyre not these perfect people either they all have these flaws elsa is too hard on herself and others kristoff and anna are both kind of socially awkward and hans well you have to watch the movie to find out about hans i also like that the characters are dynamic in other words they grow as the story progresses the supporting characters are great too and ultimately the supporting cast is what makes this such a fun movie the plot is great really original as far as im concerned ive never seen a movie with a plot quite this unique the basic premise is unique but then on top of that the climax and resolution are total surprises you never expect the ending to turn out the way it does the plot twists are numerous and and this is surprising because usually movies geared toward kids are much simpler not the case here no discussion of this movie would be complete without a word about the music there are four what i would call main songs do you wanna build a snowman for the first time in forever love is an open door and let it go there are some other songs as well like fixer upper in summer and reindeers are better than people this has finally overturned my reigning champion for best songs in a movie rocky iv these songs are just so good they get stuck in your head constantly but theyre not annoying theyre real songs they could be hits on their own i feel like the songs really overshadow the superb soundtrack by christophe beck his score is a masterpiece and it really completes the movie i really hope disney continues to make animated movies like this i was thoroughly impressed it doesnt matter what your age or walk of life if you like good movies youll love frozen highly recommended 
a beautiful new disney masterpiece this movie shows how family often does things to protect the ones we love even when they dont understand it its also about coming into your own person and doing whatever it takes for your family and friends its about finding who loves you for you and sometimes you are wrong but learning from your mistakes is all part of being human growing up even if you are a princess this is a beautiful story that goes beyond the surface love it the music is great a must see 
a great story of sister love with beautiful computer graphics and use of color the music is great and the story is fun 
got it for movie night at elderly apartment complex and the residents were just silent thru out the entire movie this movie put them in a trance and mesmerized them all we got rave reviews on this cute movie very good annimation
great animated film and i love the music 
frozen is disney at its best its been a few years and im glad to see the studio going back to what works well for them why did they stop putting great music into their animated films i wont go over the plot many good reviews have already done that i will say especially with my blu ray copy the picture is clear and wonderful to look at the computer animation is dazzling the story is a great change of pace its the story about the bond between two sisters and the love they have for each other in addition these two women arent your typical disney damsels in distress they may make a few poor choices but in the end they arent the victims but actually the heroes and for once the message isnt that you have to find your prince but that you can do whatever you wish to with a little hard work and be who you are its a simple message and a great one all wrapped up in a magical musical visually stunning package dont worry about the hype its a fun movie and a great ride 
i grew up watching disney cartoons like everyone else i love aladdin lion king mulan etc but since toy story its been about cgi instead of hand drawing cartoons and theres nothing wrong with that theres nothing wrong with the plot of this story either as a year old male whos not the nicest person in the world i am happy with this purchase first of all my daughter loves it and anything i can get to make her happy im all for it secondly there are some catchy tunes in this film i dont have to go into detail about them as im sure most of you have seen it multiple times by now and know the catchier tunes price was right shipping was fast and free and it looks great on blu ray sure its become something like a money grab after its initial success but thats what business is about toys blankets games the whole but the kids like it and thats all that matters 
this movie is highly addicting just to warn you i have seen it many times now and so have a few of my friends it is a great movie that has some catchy songs to boot many people can relate to the feelings of each of the characters in the movie at one point or another some maybe not so much it is a perfect movie for a night in or with family anyone want to build a snowman love is the most powerful of all it will remain always 
i watched this movie just to get in touch everyone i know is singing the theme song i read all the hype the fact they elected to remove all the crosses even from joan of arc which i thought was silly and while making a point it only made the two seconds joan was on screen historically incorrect the movie was set in the era of the blending of the viking era and the beginnings of the christian era so you had druid runes and magic along with a bishop and christianity thats what adults saw what kid saw was a talking snowman and beautiful castles and pretty girls with handsome men singing and working through their problems this movie touches kids for some reason im not sure i really get why it works so well but it is really entertaining and ive seen it a few times now its worth the time and money for children and adults 
loved it my granddaughter and i have watched it at least three times its such a tender story between sisters 
we have seen this movie in the theaters four times it is the best disney princess movie ever the movie opens as sisters elsa and anna play together as children elsa creating ice and snow magic for her younger sister tragedy ends their play and changes the girls lives forever their parents lives end abruptly and we fast forward to the day of elsas coronation chaos ensues as elsas gift is revealed she flees into the now snowy wilderness anna vows to save her sister and bring her home but what jumped off the screen at me was not the story itself but the way elsa and her gift were treated by everyone a troll asks born with it or cursed as if her difference could not possibly be a positive thing her parents dismiss the staff separate elsa from her sister and teach her to keep to herself and hide her difference she is taught that she needs to control her powers but never how to control her gift or even that her gift could be a positive thing my review cannot begin to do justice to what i am trying to convey but any spectrum person who has ever been told to change to fit into a neurotypical world will be able to relate to this film in a way that i have never encountered before when elsa leaves people behind and belts out let it go it is like she is singing a new aspie anthem it is only when elsa learns that her difference is a gift that she can begin to be around others and the others they have learned a lesson too that elsa is not a monster or a witch that her difference is a positive thing as an added bonus all of our favorite leading characters are social misfits elsa and anna have been separated from society leading anna to blurt out any number of inappropriate remarks her wilderness guide kristoph has likewise grown up in isolation except for his family of trolls themselves hardly typical and the snowman olaf and kristophs reindeer sven are also offbeat in fact the only characters who appear to be neurotypical are the girls well meaning but misguided parents annas love interest hans spoiler omited the horrid minister of wieselton and the assorted townfolk and servants its enough to give neurotypicals a bad name take your aspie to see this movie you will love the experience it will leave you with a great deal to talk about 
this has to be one of the best disney movies ive seen i love disney movies and i love strong female characters this movie has two of them now that i have two boys though i wish thered been more strong male supporting characters the men in the movie were eh i thought the guys in princess and the frog were similarly not particularly strong characters i guess im referring to being more than silly mature etc 
frozen is one of those movies that make you feel like you are watching a play the music takes you to a new level of entertainment let it go is so powerful that it has made history in its debut i strongly recommend this movie for both children and the adults that love them reviewed by dr michael provitera author of the childrens book titled happy go lucky 
i took my niece to see this movie as she was asking me for over a month lots of per movie hype i figured i could handle hours of anything although my first choice was certainly not a cartoon well to my surprise it was so much better then i had expected it to be and my niece loved as in really really loved this movie this is all i have heard her talking about since we went she cannot get enough of the characters so i ordered this new dvd for us to watch over and over again the story is explained in the first couple reviews so i will not waste the space to explain it go see the movie disney really outdid themselves this time 
disney studios rd full length animated feature film frozen may be the best musical since fiddler on the roof disney has been on a roll the last few years giving us the princess and the frog tangled wreck it ralph and now frozen once again disney blows it up in the animation department and olaf the snowman is another memorable sidekick i must admit that when i saw the trailer for this film at least a year or so ago i thought it looked pretty generic and it didnt interest me at all but being a collector of disney animated films i knew i would be purchasing it and hoping for the best im not really into musicals especially live action type i find most of them very artificial i guess its more eerily for me to accept cartoon characters bursting into song for no apparent reason the songs in frozen are really good and they fit the situations well and i cant remember a musical i enjoyed more since fiddler on the roof yes its that good the blu ray looks flawless but imagine my disappointent when i viewed the bonus feature entitled the making of frozen only to find a minute song explaining they dont know huh disney has been really getting under my skin lately as most of these great films i mentioned earlier in this review all have pretty sad releases i guess well have to wait for the platinum or diamond release for all these great films to get some worthy bonus material i almost deducted a star because of the lack of quality extras on this blu ray dvd combo but the film is great and it looks and sounds fantastic just dont expect to be wowed by the bonus stuff 
this is one of those rare movies that actually gets better the more times you watch it rather than the reverse the first time i watched it i thought it was cute but couldnt really see what all the hype was about the twentieth time yeah i got a year old i was singing and dancing along with it thinking that they totally nailed it the musical scores in this movie are easily equal to if not better than those of any other animated movie i really enjoyed spoiler how this movie makes fun of the genre by mocking love at first sight 
such a great movie to watch my grandson has watched so many times i think it will be warn out it is a great show for the kids and family altogether the music is great my grandchildren sing to it and they remember the words get the movie if you havent yet 
this movie was ahhh fantastic my family loved it so did i the visuals were amazing and the story itself is wonderful 
during the entirety of frozen i was in thrall at what was occurring on the screen in front of me honestly it was kind of hard to tell what was hitting me as i cheered cried and almost stood up clapping for the characters on screen by the time the credits were rolling and the hairs on my arms were still standing up i still wasnt sure what to think so i walked out of the theater then bought another ticket to the next showtime walking home as the sunset after the second screening it became clear to me frozen is the best thing disney has put out in well over a decade and will probably go down in cinema history as one of the greatest artistic achievements in animation oh yes and its a darn fine film in its own right for adults and children alike a very loose retelling of the snow queen that walt disney himself had been planning since the s frozen tells a tale of two sisters anna and elsa from a very young age they were inseparable and played together all the time but when elsas control over the element of ice threatens her sisters life her father puts her powers under control and erases annas memories of her sister ever being anything but normal years go by and a rift occurs between the siblings which comes to a head on the day of elsas coronation as queen anna angers her sister into fleeing and releasing an eternal winter for their oceanic trading town as well as the entire land to undo the damage she must find elsa and reason with her lest the livelihood of thousands be threatened with the help of the travelling ice merchant kristoph and his silly reindeer sven and the lively snowman olaf she goes up against seemingly insurmountable odds to save the day thats about the most basic description i can give of the film without giving away too much which is a wonderful thing to say because for the first time in far too long disney has created a movie that is almost entirely unpredictable and incredibly subversive in terms of what we expect from them startling new revelations occur at a very rapid rate especially during the films masterful climax which completely floored me due its unwillingness to fall into trite cliche territory the admittedly great tangled looks like small potatoes compared to how fantastic this movie in terms of its powerful and surprising narrative and jennifer lee should be commended for her masterful screenplay as well as her direction alongside chris buck what really makes this a special film as mentioned above is how its unlike anything disney normally puts out routinely the movie takes out trite tropes and plot devices from their usual stock dangles them in front of our faces to the point of approaching parody then coyly smashes them to pieces right before our very eyes and does something entirely new while i cant really give examples without spoiling the movie i can assure you that this isnt the typical disney experience and it feels like the aging studio has turned a new page much like it did in the s with the release of the little mermaid ironically another hans christian anderson piece speaking of the little mermaid this is another tale with incredibly strong female leads in anna and elsa anna will stop at nothing to simple establish better bonds with her sister and elsas struggle to contain her power and be herself can be paralleled to the struggles faced by young women growing up in modern society their rich characterizations reinforce the idea that girls dont need to grow up looking for a prince in shining armor and instead can be strong and independent by their own merits the same can be said for the character of kristoph who teaches the idea of chivalry versus sheltering teamwork versus saving the damsel in distress for children frozen carries some fantastic messages that parents are sure to appreciate and are much different from other kids movies today on top of the great writing and rich characterizations the visuals on display are simply majestic the characters are deeply expressive and creatively designed with crisply animated flowing hair and endearingly exaggerated physical attributes set pieces are a wonder to behold from elsas beautiful ice castle to the mysterious frozen tundras trekked across by elsa and kristoph everything in this film is pure eye candy of the highest caliber and easily one of the best works of cg animation to come out of the field for quite some time years down the line this will most likely still be captivating to look at the same can be said for the voice work and music as both are top notch every character is perfectly cast and while its really difficult to pick favorites i must say that idina menzels mysterious and sultry voice as elsa is enchanting to the ears and her soulful singing voice during both her solo bits and duets make me suspect there might be an oscar for best original song in her future all of the singing complements christophe becks truly awesome score which includes some of the best songs in all of disney history including the tear jerking anthem to freedom let it go heart wrenching ballad of sororal love do you want to build a snowman and the peppy uptempo piece in summer great music and a talented cast round out the film into a complete wonderful package its no secret that disneys been in a bit of a bind lately what with uninspired sequels and tired standalone films with worn out premises but tangled was a step in the right direction and now frozen is an unabashed dash ahead in that very same direction make no mistake this is not just a great work of animation or a well done disney film it is a truly superb and divine cinematic experience the likes of which only comes along a few times every decade or so if were lucky regardless of your age or whether you like these types of movies or not this is something you must experience if you like movies or more basically if you like feeling happy watch this film without delay frozen is an artistic achievement beyond comprehension and perhaps a sign that we are on the precipice of disneys second renaissance grade a superb 
its unrealistic to watch animated movies these days and be able to call one better than all the rest and that goes for disney movies too true enough each year one animated feature eventually goes on to win an academy award along with several other awards but for the most part even the years most praised film looks just like the last only a select few films in the last decade like toy story monsters inc and finding nemo will withstand the test of time and possibly earn a place in the same conversation as disney classics like cinderella snow white and the seven dwarfs the little mermaid and beauty and the beast still every now and then disney treats animated movie lovers to something special and to be completely honest its been quite a while this might be a bit premature to say but disney has finally struck gold once more and not just commercially with a film that has the potential to be one of the greatest animated films every created that film is called frozen chris buck and jennifer lee write along with shane morris and direct disneys frozen loosely based on the snow queen a story created by hans christian anderson the film begins with the introduction of two young children both princesses elsa and anna however elsa has the power to control the winter elements ice and snow after a terrible accident the girls parents decide to isolate elsa from anna and wipe annas mind clean about elsas powers in order to protect anna from knowing the truth flash forward several years the day has come for elsa idina menzel to claim her right as the queen of arendelle now an adult and queen elsa must face the people of her kingdom all of whom she has hidden herself away since she is unable to control her powers unfortunately her greatest fear comes true after an encounter with anna kristen bell who spontaneously decides she wants to marry a visiting prince hans santino fontana unwilling to give her blessing for the marriage and angry with her sister elsa unintentionally unleashes her powers on the entire kingdom instantly turning winter to summer elsa quickly leaves the kingdom and rushes to the mountains creating her own palace of ice away from anyone and everyone feeling responsible anna embarks on a quest along with a mountain based ice maker kristoff jonathan groff his reindeer sven and a magical snowman olaf josh gad to bring the queen home for whatever reason disney moved away from the on screen musicals that provided some of the most memorable soundtracks in film history you may recall a whole new world from aladdin and circle of life from the lion king as being just the tip of the iceberg in a massive library of memorable songs over a variety of films in all likelihood disney simply got sidetracked with spectacular new animation and the realization that d implementation had endless potential which is hardly the case regardless the diehard lovers of disney classics will be happy that the company has decided to revisit the musical aspect of storytelling both kristin bell and idina menzel simply thrive with their heartfelt energetic voices and even though theres very little about the songs in frozen that stand out the hope is that disney will continue with this classic trend the music meshed with the story easily makes frozen one of the most unique animated features in recent memory just when you think you have this story figured out it will absolutely surprise you with its misdirection initially frozen appears to be a film that will pit sister vs sister sort of like a good witch of the north vs the wicked witch of the west dynamic however that couldnt be further from the truth as there is a serious amount of character inner turmoil and theme driven action going on here instead one princess is desperate to protect the world from her own actions even though she becomes exactly what she hoped to avoid the other princess is more traditional with her intent to find true love and save her sister plus the kingdom and her sister both of which she loves to no end like the story itself the characters are also much different than anything youd expect out of a film of this nature every little girl on this planet will fall in love with anna the happiest princess you could possibly ever imagine kristin bell is a splendid choice for this role bringing an enthusiasm to a character that you cant help but adore she breaks out into song early and often singing songs including do you want to build a snowman and love is an open door even menzel who is portraying a bit of a tragic character sings with reassurance in songs that include let it go and for the first time in forever the most outstanding premise in this film is the fact that there is no major antagonist while that is a bit surprising for an animated film the story goes in a much more thematic direction queen elsa is the closest thing to a villain in this story but she doesnt mean to be her goal is to protect the people she cares about but fails miserably as the story progresses it becomes more about redeeming an individual that has simply lost her way and needs help to find the path back to the light to help the queen there are a few odd characters that shine in their own unique manner including a comical snowman and a moose that loves his carrots even though the film progresses in a mostly serious tone these two supporting characters wont fail to make you laugh overall theres very little not to like about frozen it contains an honest to goodness message that parents should feel free subjecting their children to the film is far lighter on the animated violence that has been much more prominent in many films recently and the action sequences that do occur are either playful or of the supernatural variety for young boys the constant presence of princesses may be a bit tedious but the girls will absolutely love them anna and elsa might just be in line for the massive commercial success of ariel and tinker bell in any event disney has a monster hit on their hands that will easily thrive on all formats theater home video etc for years and years to come grade afndnreview com
this disney movie captures the depth of the love between sisters like few other animated films i have seen in recent memory it portrays the deep concern playful competitveness and driving desire to help and protect your sibling that perfectly demonstrates the bond between siblings particularly sisters that is at the heart of this movie as a father of two girls i am always on the lookout for entertainment that helps reinforce the importance and uniqueness of this kind of relationship frozen wonderfully accomplishes this goal through creative storytelling it reminds me very much of lion king which for me is the disney gold standard i hold their films to in lion king you had a movie that majestically covered the relationship between father and son in a way that no other animated movie could match too often animated films focus on the bond between mother and daughter or daughter and father but rarely has disney done father and son and when they did it with lion king it was amazing the same can now be said about frozen and the way it portrays sisterly love it is tragic in the beginning to see how the relationship is set up and the deep divide between sisters and how that grows into something magical and beautiful with true love lauded not with a prince or male act of love but the love between two sisters and the lengths they will go through for each other again as a father of two girls i have grown uneasy with the way many of these movies focus so much on the prince saving the day and the princess waiting for her prince charming to validate her journey here the prince is not what he seems and the man does not save the day it is the kind of story telling i desire to see more of strong female characters should be able to save themselves and in fact should be able to save the prince you can safely ignore all the lofty overarching themes of sisterly love and female empowerment and focus on a good story for you and your family it has amazing music and songs let it go is sung in my household on a daily basis it is serious but wholesome story telling and is entertaining for all ages disney really knocked it out of the park with this one dont hesistate to get this for your family i assure you it will be on regular rotation on your dvd bluray player for a long time to come 
frozen is a disney fantasy animated film inspired by the story the snow queen by hans christian anderson author of the little mermaid and thumbelina i absolutely loved this movie i dont think its overrated and i truly do think its a disney masterpiece anna and elsa are such wonderful characters the movie has a beautiful and dramatic story lots of magic amazing songs lovable characters and an adorable supporting character named olaf the story is very serious and dramatic in some parts but it has lots of funny moments as well i truly loved the ending of this movie this is a wonderful movie and i recommend it to anyone 
we watched frozen last night and it was one of the best animated films ive ever seen it was so heart warming funny the animation was stunning and the singing and music were wonderful i just preordered the dvd because i wanted to go right back into the theater and watch it again right then and there 
i bought oz the great and powerful and after i bought the blu ray combo pack with digital copy it offered me a d disc to be sent out for plus shipping i am going for that and if that is not an option i am going to the uk amazon for the d version disney why would you pull out the d disc when this has been your most successful musical movie since tangled go to disney movie rewards enter your magic code and then see if it is offered but it was only offered for oz for a week or two frozen was good and was a spectacle in d 
i bought this as a present for our grandchildren and as with most things from disney they like it which is the opinion that matters in this case 
a great animated movie about how love can turn things around when you have had a fight or misunderstanding with a family member i highly recommend this not only for the young but for the older generation too since we at time or another do disagree and stop caring over the slightest thing and it only takes to believe that it can be as it once was by the love in your heart i really did enjoy this and hope that many others get to watch and enjoy as i have since i come from a family of children dating from to there are only of us left now but we do disagree at times but we do make up since our mother and father saw to it that we were all of blood with the same love watch and you too will walk down memory lane with those you care about 
i purchased this movie with amazon prime and of course as promised i got it two days after it was released great shipping program with ap also i really wanted the d version but according to the sources ive been able to find that may not happen until later in the year and then disney will require me to purchase this movie again i find the beauty of this movie stunning the video is amazing and the story is compelling its a very good movie for all ages 
i chose amazon to buy this from so i could get the digital copy provided by them i have a kindle the movie itself is enjoyable i watch it even when the kids arent home 
to fans of disney and musicals there hasnt been a more satisfying phenomenon than frozen when disney is true to itself making the kind of movies that have been the hallmark of the studio for over years its magic the thing not magic the word at first glance frozen doesnt seem to break any new ground for the genre its great storytelling a marvelous score spectacular visuals everything one expects from classic disney but its overwhelming success suggests that it is more of a landmark than it may seem they listened to their audience not through data research and focus groups but in everyday life this movie has true insight into where young and old really are in this day and age possible more than most live action movies frozen taps into commitment loyalty frustration self sacrifice and the many forms of love its not all about me me me ultimately its about we we we you just dont see this much in todays entertainment which leans toward the you deserve a break today message to me the best thing about frozen is the music the songs and the background score which tends to be overshadowed by the great songs this means that family musicals may have life again and perhaps survive a little longer than in the past disneys life blood is animation but its soul is music and the songwriting innovation that the lopezes brought with them from the stage as well as their fine work on winnie the pooh and finding nemo the musical is the revue song there have been many humorous disney songs but never with this precise kind of verbal interplay yet their work is extremely reverential to the disney musical canon and the great talents that created all those songs the bonus features are nice but there will probably be more on the inevitable crystal edition or some such reissue since frozen has shattered home entertainment records the way it did at the box office and in billboard you let it go girl blu ray bonus features original theatrical short get a horse the making of frozen d frosted disneys journey from hans christian andersento frozen deleted scenes with optional intros from directors never underestimate the power of elsathe dressing roommeet kristoff meet kristoff let it go music videos original teaser trailerdvd bonus featuresoriginal theatrical short get a horse let it go music videos
there is an old saying that goes figures never lie but liars figure ninety percent of amazon reviewers rate frozen as a or in terms of world wide appeal frozen has become the highest grossing animated film of all time now detractors will quickly point out that when inflation is considered frozen loses its top ranking however there is a lot more competition for frozens movie ticket dollars than existed for older films how many of you waited until frozen came out on blu ray to watch the film the point is that frozen is a tremendous success and that would not have happened unless the movie was something truly special a prevalent theme in many reviews both within and outside of amazons forum is repeated viewing by the reviewer or their acquaintances this is probably the highest compliment that a film can garner and is a hallmark of great cinema so percent of reviewers can slam frozen and claim that it is a waste of time but they are a statistical anomaly that can be scientifically discounted by the way elsa rocks 
my five boys from to have loved this show they are not disney fans as a rule but this one has enthralled them they love the movie and they love the music i catch them every now and then singing the songs to themselves when they think no one is listening my husband and i have also enjoyed this show we are huge kristen bell fans as well as idena fans superb acting job to both of them and the music was indeed awesome anyone who has had a problem with this show either hasnt watched it or hasnt watched it with children i had one kid say he didnt want to watch it the he sat sat the entire time and was glued to the show he had a blast while watching it but as soon as it was over he said he hated it and walked away but he started talking about the parts he liked as soon as he thought i wasnt listening 
im over and bought this for myself because the movie is so sweet with catchy songs its just a feel good movie im a disney lover and glad to see this latest movie so entertaining made my husband watch it and caught him smiling often this blu ray version plays beautiful with awesome surround sound on our home system stars all the way no fixer upper here 
i can sing and act and do a one woman show of this movie my daughter is and sings along and knows what parts are coming up when we are obsessed haha 
such a wonderful movie i love everything about this movie and it looks gorgeous on blu ray if you have not seen this movie yet i highly recommend you watch it you will not be disappointed
id let my daughter write this but she complained there is no stars grade brilliant even from my perspective great songs characters to feel for and a neat little twist at the end of the movie took my other daughter many years ago to see beauty and the beast this is of the same ilk and quality havent enjoyed a cartoon as much as this since toy story and up and thats high praise indeed 
im with nearly everyone else this is the best disney animated film in years and may be the best since beauty and the beast a heartwarming tale of separation and devotion between sisters disney undoes years of damage to girls psyches by redefining true love as something other than the kiss of a handsome prince whose heart doesnt ache at the dilemma of anna and elsa who doesnt thrill to the action sequences and laugh at the hijinx of the adorable snowman olaf the actors bring all the characters vividly to life the casting of kristen bell as the feisty optimistic anna and idina menzel as her gifted but troubled sister elsa is fantastic visually stunning the color schemes and special effects rock the songs are short witty hummable and always enhance character or move the action forward let it go has become a rather annoying earworm from constant radio play but is perfect in the context of the film although the female characters are cinch waisted with little button noses they are active powerful individuals elsa struggles to understand and control her powers while anna is directly engaged in every effort to save her sister frozen is a wonderful change of pace for animated films its messages of enduring love and female empowerment are a positive influence especially for the young audiences flocking to see it thanks disney 
it was not what i expected from disney it was a musical i was not really into it but i kept watching and surprise surprise it was great as you know there is always something underlining a picture like this like the lorax save the forest else when it is gone there is no way to get it back same with frozen i learned something that i had long forgotton or just took it as normal this was great and the ending magical
without a doubt the best disney animated film since the lion king and beauty and the beast borrowing heavily from the best of broadway this film is loaded with talent art design direction plot and music are all on target this film works on every level and is a masterwork of animated film 
like most adults on here i was skeptical that this would be a diamond in the rough but after siting down and watching this wonderful story and musical movie i can say without a doubt this is a wonderful movie to become a classic for years to come from start to finish this movie was an amazing story with that disney charm that has been missing for some time now without a doubt this is a wonderful movie to enjoy for all even those in the northern climates who are so tired of winter lol highly recommend for all to buy this wonderful story my and only negative to this is that while the rest of the world is getting this movie in d disney decided that even tho this was shot in d and sold very very well in theatres in d they decided to not give the us a d release so with that in mind yes buy this movie but if you want to experience this in d your going to be forced to import the d disc from other countries rumor canada has it and a fact the eu amazon story does carry it hope it will be region free and enjoy this movie
this story line musical is the caliber of beauty and the beast well written dialog songs if you take time to listen to all the lyrics it weaves the story together beautifully great voices for characters olaf is adorable cute like boo monsters inc love that the story is based on hans christian anderson story if one builds on his stories it will be a hit he has virtuous stories that are much needed today 
when i first saw the trailers i couldnt figure out what this movie was really about and even expected it to be bad i heard the reviews from people bashing it i didnt read what the critics had to say and decided that i would be the judge of good or bad my first recommendation is this dont listen to what anyone tells you good or bad be your own judge now already thinking this movie would be bad just from the trailers i went ahead and gave it a chance i thought the plot would follow the classic formula which in a sense it did but it has major twists and if you really look into how the plot plays out you will discover a very powerful message it ended up being nothing as i had imagined it ended up in my opinion being one of the most fulfilling animated movies that i had ever seen granted i know my disney animated movies pretty well and there are stories i cared about growing up and others that i didnt think were great and missed the mark all else i will say is this although it may have a prince and princesses it wasnt a story about a prince and a princess it was about learning the definition of what love is really about for people that couldnt see that well they are missing the mark for those of you that do see the point i guarantee that it will be worth it i suggest you watch the movie before buying the dvd and decide afterwards if you want to invest in having it be part of your collection one thing i will add john lasseter has been a driving force in making very compelling stories and he was very much involved in frozen i loved it but be your own judge 
i just dont expect anything when watching mainstream movies in this country anymore story character development forget it and disney is the worst the same thing over and over again i only watched this movie because the kids at work insisted on it i was blown away the story was terrific i loved the characters and no cheese the one sequence with let it go was spectacular and the end was truly special im so blessed to have been able to share the experience with the children at my work i wont ever forget them or this movie thank you jeff heinsohn
my daughter loves this movie and the best part is that her name is elsa my wife was pretty cutting edge when she named her anyhow the songs are so catch and wonderful we sing along to most songs during the movie especially love is an open door let it go and the first time in forever we even like doing frozen and reindeer are better than people the character development is well done and the movie is just so wonderful 
my daughter is on her th viewing its sb don t judge we loved as a family too fantastic bday present 
i love frozen i have three sisters and this movie shows why sisterhood is a bond like no other even though elsa and anna had not been friends for quite a few years their bond was still enough to conquer all it redefines true love the story line is amazing this is exactly what little girls need plus olaf is the best supporting character i have ever seen 
i have to say that this is one of the few recent disney movies to come out that ive been entranced with the story was very well done and i liked that it had an element that both adults and children could enjoy without anything being too groan worthy or going over the heads of young and old viewers alike i went and saw this three times in the theater twice without my kids it was just an all around good movie and i recommend if anyone loves musicals or enjoys feel good movies to see this one 
i have to admit i almost feel a little embarrassed giving frozen my highest rating however in spite of my reservations about this retelling er disneyfication of hans christian andersens snow queen being a cg film and not a traditional one the latter format could have been used just as effectively for a film like this frozen is surprisingly really good which is not something i was expecting to say given how disappointed i was with tangled however frozen earns my highest rating for the following reasons while this is a disneyfied snow queen its not done in the manner one would normally expect this is arguably a darker edgier re imagining the title queen in this story is elsa one of two sisters whose primary motivation for causing eternal winter is not out of outright evil but for more complex issues the whole conflict starts off because of an accident that traumatized her and her sister anna in childhood leading the girl to become emotionally distant this lends a surprisingly more adult angle to the story but the best part about frozen is how disney turns two of its tried and true cliches completely on its heels there is a handsome prince yes and he does romance anna but not for the reasons one would expect furthermore the climactic act of true love needed to break elsas spell isnt romantic but sister related its because of this that frozen emerges as one of disneys best fairy tales in a long time the chemistry between the principal characters is also very well done especially the sister dynamic between the more aloof distant elsa and the outgoing socially awkward but sweet natured anna prince hans as mentioned isnt the picture perfect figure youd expect if anything the most interesting character has to be kristoff a somewhat grumpy ice hauler who grudgingly agrees to help anna find her but naturally he turns out to be a real soft hearted gentleman naturally this does give this film a love triangle angle but to reveal how it is resolved would be the equivalent of giving spoilers the music is also great especially elsas charged ballad let it go the only exception is a gospel flavored song involving trolls which isnt bad by any means it just struck me as out of place with the tone of the story even the occasional comic relief from a snowman and a mute elk doesnt overpower the dramatic depth of the story there are a few places where i think disney could have toned down the laughs though but its nowhere nearly as grating as in tangled im not quite sure where frozen ranks in terms of disneys all time greatest films but i was pleasantly charmed by it and it exceeded my expectations 
great movie disney out did itself i have two teen sons one a marine very funny to hear them singing along and really getting into the movie theres action theres the love interest theres great scenery and great music i was not looking forward to the goofy looking animated snowman kinda dreading that actually but he turned out ok and added some interest to the movie i can say that my peers at work who have daughters now know all the music by heart disney added some extra magic to this movie and i need to see it again to figure it out excellent for the whole family jdmc
frozen tells the story of two sisters daughters of the king of arendelle unfortunately there are two problems first the older sister elsa has the power to make things freeze but not have full control of it after a childhood accident where elsa almost harmed her sister anna the parents have annas memories altered so that she doesnt remember her sisters special abilities the girls are separated from each other and isolated from the rest of arendelle in the castle the second problem is after a few years the parents go on a trip and die the girls grow up in a rather austere life which is finally intruded upon by elsas coronation when people are again invited into the castle elsa barely makes it through the coronation ceremony without her power going haywire meanwhile anna has met and fallen in love with a prince from a faraway land who has come for the celebration he is quite charming and seems like such a good match that he proposes and she accepts ask elsa for her blessing at the ball to which she says you cant possibly marry someone you just met things escalate and elsas power go out of control she flees to the mountains her power has caused a massive winter storm that causes perpetual winter in arendelle anna decides to go after her sister eventually joining up with kristoff a mountain man whose ice selling business is hurting thanks to the july deep freeze they search for elsa to bring her back home and end the storm the movie is quite delightful the songs are good and the story moves along at a brisk pace the animation is beautiful especially the several snow and ice scenes the d is fine though not remarkable where this movie really shines is the relationships between the various characters especially the sisters most parents probably agree wholeheartedly with elsa when she forbids her sister to marry a man shes only known for a day theyve had a strained relationship due to their isolation from each other which is partly elsas own choosing since she does not want to hurt her sister they try to love each other but are unsure of what is best the theme of what is true love is well explored throughout the movie at one point a group of pleasant trolls try to marry kristoff and anna to each other they sing a delightful song about how kristoff is a fixer upper comically describing his foibles both physical and social that she needs to know about and put up with as the song progresses the trolls realize anna needs some fixing up too and not just her dress while highly comical the song also points out that we all have our imperfections and that love needs to be more than idealistic romanticism the theme is explored with a sort of depth rare in disney princess movies i highly recommend the movie 
bought this movie for my grandchildren but the whole family watched it together my grandchildren have already watched it multiple times 
this is one of the best movies this year i enjoyed it as much as my granddaughter did i think it is heart felt so you might need some tissues my friend cried through parts of it but you will not be disappointed dont pass this one up 
i purchased this movie for my nephew but i ended up enjoying it as uch as he did the relationship between elsa and anna was touching and olaf was hilarious we ended up watching the movie four times straight 
i got this movie for my kiddo months after it came out i saw a couple previews for it while it was in the theatres but silly me i thought it was going to be about a reindeer and a snowman so we didnt go see it then i heard something about a princess and magical powers and gave it a try and she loves it after we finally watched it for the first time my kids entire class has become obsessed with it all they play at school and all they draw is scenes and characters from this movie and its been going on for months one of the greatest princess movies ever i even know a lot of little boys who love it slam dunk on this film 
this movie is in my opinion the best disney movie since the lion king i am sure we could all debate the best disney films but some standout as classics and have a certain grandeur to the songs and the story i believe the word transcendent would be appropriate to describe those disney films that really make disney well disney this movie is one of those movies my daughters sing these songs and are hooked to watching the musical excerpts on you tube because this movie wasnt out yet little do they know i just bought it for them and they will be thrilled when i was younger they made several great movies that bring back the nostalgia they were perfect with beauty and the beast and the lion king and i probably need to throw the little mermaid and maybe alladin in this group i am sure when my girls look back this is going to be the disney movie of their childhood that stands above all the others i am glad disney is still making such wonderful family friendly movies it seems a long time since theyve made one this good great musical numbers magic princesses lovable memorable characters disney throwback 
love disneys ability to always render such quality so moving in parts i was brought to tears wonderful viewing for the whole family 
good family entertainment disney still gets it right if the movie industry needs to make money then give us great clean movies thats not too hard right 
this is maybe the best movie of the visuals are stunning you can almost loose yourself in the ice palace the plot is somewhat complicated and the things revealed very sad i cant go into any of it without a spoiler tip off the characters get you to either love them or really hate them on their own merits for their own part and there is only one clownish one dimensional character the snowman who i thought would be a pest from the adds was fun o k im failing rent it then buy it if you like it 
this is the first movie my little one would actually sit through shes just under months she even shouts out elsa and anna and at the song let it go she started singing with the song although she was saying go away she did get scared at the snow monster part she looked away and started to cry so we fast forwarded through that part i think over time shell see that its ok all in all i expect to watch this movie a lot 
i absolutely loved this movie everything about it i am bummed to see that disney has no plans currently to release this in d which is what i saw at the movies i am a huge disney movie fan but this is the best movie since lion king tangled and brave were both great but i loved frozen my yr old niece loves this movie and she actually never saw it in the theatres just the previews and all she wanted was frozen merchandise for christmas actually when i first saw the previews i was like it looks cute but ill wait to see it when it comes out on br but then i started seeing more previews on tv and decided i had to see it i even dragged my husband who isnt a huge disney fan to see it with me and he really enjoyed it so never immediate judge a movie with the first preview you see give it time 
i have to admit to being among the many people who was turned off from this movie by the previews and promotional material based loosely on one of hans christian andersens classic tales it might be but the trailers chose to focus primarily on an annoying talking snowman and a cute reindeer i understand that disney has long marketed itself to children but surely in the years disney has been creating movies theyve learned that there are plenty of teens and adults who watch their films as well surely theres a market for this audience or at least room for some ads that promote the more dramatic or adventurous elements of an animated film rather than focusing exclusively on the plucky comic relief issues with the advertising campaign aside i finally caved to word of mouth and watched this film and i was pleasantly surprised to find that instead of a goofy animated romp its a wonderful fantasy adventure drama that all ages can enjoy inspired by andersens fairy tale the snow queen frozen follows the story of two princesses aloof and reserved older sister elsa who struggles to hide her growing ice powers from the world and the clumsy and naive but eternally optimistic anna who cant understand why her sister shuts everyone out of her life when disaster strikes on elsas coronation day and her powers are revealed to the world she flees to the mountains accidentally plunging the kingdom into eternal winter undeterred anna rides off to find her sister and bring her home and gains some unexpected allies along the way crude and antisocial but kindhearted ice worker kristoff his pet reindeer sven and the clueless but ever curious living snowman olaf annas quest is complicated along the way however for elsa doesnt want to return home and there are powers conspiring to seize the throne back home many of disneys non pixar computer animated films have been sadly lackluster in the past in comparison to pixar and dreamworks chicken little meet the robinsons and the wild all come to mind but like tangled before it frozen is gorgeously animated maintaining the look and feel of its classic animated films while still portraying its fairy tale world in lush detail the winter wonderland of this film is beautifully portrayed especially elsas ice palace and the snow locked kingdom she leaves behind and the characters are well rendered and animated without falling into the uncanny valley as some cgi humans tend to do see polar express the first toy story and even the human characters in the shrek movies my one nitpick is that the cgi water looks a little wonky but then water is a difficult substance to animate the story is only vaguely similar to the original fairy tale but this is not a bad thing disney has created a beautiful original tale that subverts and twists many of the familiar disney themes and tropes creating something fresh and new something the franchise has desperately needed the nature of true love is explored the princesses are fully realized characters who arent constantly in need of rescuing the heroes and villains arent always what they seem to be and for once we get a disney queen who isnt evil after years of having to put up with princess good queen evil its really nice to see disney bucking this trend once and for all hopefully they continue to subvert it and of course the songs for this movie are amazing almost all the voice actors do their own singing for this film which is a refreshing change from the normal system of hiring separate vas for the speaking and singing parts and instead of going for big name movie actors this film uses actors with broadway musical experience such as kristin bell best known from veronica mars though she got her start on broadway idina menzel best known from wicked santino fontana best known from rodgers and hammersteins cinderella and josh gad best known from the book of mormon the songs are written by veteran broadway duo robert lopez and kristen anderson lopez avenue q and the book of mormon and the orchestra score by christopher becke buffy the vampire slayer and the muppets and the phenomenal singing and songwriting talent for the film pay off with some of the catchiest and most heartfelt songs yet for a disney musical after seeing more modern disney films eschew songs for the most part its been wonderful seeing a return to the full on animated musicals of the past and the snowman sidekick yes hes a little annoying but hes actually very sweet as well and doesnt detract from the movie and despite what the previews say he doesnt even show up until about the halfway mark and doesnt hog the screen time while my favorite movie of is still pacific rim frozen is an extremely close second its the perfect blend of great animation great story and great music and is a new disney classic in my mind recommended for ages and up due to some scary scenes 
a charming and great looking loose adaptation of hans christian andersons the snow queen this animated gem from disney has a lot going for it catchy songs that are strong in both music and lyrics terrific voice acting i like that they bucked the trend of jamming in the most famous names they could in favor of actors who sound perfect as the characters actually surprising plot twists some real emotion some witty humor some dark and scary moments that dont pull all their punches and most of all some really beautiful images using snow and ice jennifer lee is surprisingly the first woman to co direct an animated feature for disney so it may be not for nothing that the film has a likable girl power attitude where the princesses take no back seat to the male characters in bravery or in action the story involves two sisters the eldest of whom has magical powers that can turn things to ice or snow control the weather and even if used wrong be deadly so after an accidental near miss with her adored younger sibling the two are kept separate and grow up with decidedly different personalities the film then jumps forward to the day of the eldests coronation as queen this brings joy to the younger extroverted and lonely sister as the palace will finally be opened and she can see the world and maybe fall in love but dread to her older sister who fears not being able to control her powers and being discovered as some sort of unwilling sorceress of course things do go awry leading to all kinds of adventure and miss adventure there are the inevitable clich eacute s here and there and a few bits seem stolen from other animated films but these are very minor problems in a film that i thoroughly enjoyed even though im many times older than the intended audience 
we are big disney fans but this movie outshines all of the movies of recent years the soundtrack is fabulous it is an epic movie 
saw this in theaters and love it my daughter and i have been singing the songs from it since and look toward to buying on dvd when it comes out the characters are loveable and all different from each other there is humor betrayal sadness and love in this movie with a great story and no crazy evil characters as disney usually does beautiful movie 
this movie is great for the whole family my girls love it and i have been able to watch it numerous times without going crazy 
gorgeous animation soaring music engaging story and characters wonderful message this movie is a long overdue return to the best kind of disney movie my kids and i both enjoyed this immensely really deserves to be seen on a big screen with good dolby 
went to see this for our anniversary and absolutely fell in love with it so much that i raved about it to everyone i knew ordered it as soon as it was available 
if you are one of the people worldwide who have not yet seen this movie then let me start by saying i have children and they all love this movie let me continue by saying that the adults in the family also love this movie ok so maybe their daddy doesnt love it but he certainly tolerates it with a smile and doesnt run screaming from the room each time it is played and it is played a lot why you may be asking yourself is there such a hullabaloo about this flick why the multibillion dollar buzz well because the script is good the animation crisp and lovely the songs so catchy you cant help but sing along the characters are great and most importantly olaf yes that wacky looking snowman is so damn funny he in my opinion makes the movie his lines are hysterical the girls of course love elsa and ana and act out their songs and scenes the trolls the reindeer sven and even the duke of weasletown are all wonderful moments and this mama loves the message you dont need a man to save you you need to be kind and generous and loving towards others that will save you and of course you dont marry a man you just met oh dear god please make sure that one sinks in lolorder the movie watch it then watch it again like a fine wine things only get better the songs and characters more familiar and the funny one liners by olaf somehow get funnier all around a great job by disney well spent enjoy 
we loved this movie in the theaters so we purchased it as soon as it came out in dvd very original great characters and clever writing i always appreciate when kids movies throw in lines for adult entertainment this one doesnt disappoint i would highly recommend it for the whole family 
my title says it all when i saw this movie in theaters i did not expect it to be breathtaking and amazing even the animation itself of the snow and ice is so beautiful that i was frozen in my seat lol but this movie also has a powerful message thats true in real life nothing in the world is more powerful than the power of love especially love among family because in the end of this movie it was the sisters undying love for each other than ended up saving the day the songs in here are also amazing come on one of them was nominated for an academy award this is a treat for all ages that no one can afford to miss 
i loved this movie ever since it came out i enjoy the humor in this movie and the way true love is showed by kindness and caring through each of the characters elsa is annas older sister she has magic ice powers but she runs away to the mountains when they get a bit out of hand anna is faithful to elsa and with the help of a friendly man named kristoff she is able to find elsa olaf the snowman is still my favorite though buy the awesome movie and enjoy frozen 
disneys is back with a slightly more fun animated feature and heartfelt spin on an old hans christian anderson story called the snow queen which was first published in the original story is a darker version compared to what disney is presenting you as always loosely based but it is considered one of the most acclaimed of all his fairy tale storys certainly the longest in length and the most illustrated of andersons works its called frozen this film features a wonderfully and positively adapted screen story by chris buck surfs up pocahontas jennifer lee wreck it ralph and shane morris the dukes of hazard the beginning and then turned into an adapted screenplay by jennifer yet the film is impressively directed by both chris and jennifer themselves the story is about two sisters who end up losing their parents and living alone as the only heirs to a kingdom one sister is special in a very private way and the other just fun loving trusting and adventurous and truly loves her big sister so very much that is until the big sister has to shut all of the kingdoms doors for what she believes is a very good reason enter a semi interested prince from another kingdom and a rough ice breaker with a feisty reindeer as a companion and you have a really fun heartwarming and colorful adventure did i mention there is a magically hysterical snowman too the younger sister is anna who is perfectly voiced and sung by kristen bell veronica mars parks recreation and her older sister who is the snow queen she discovers later is impressively voiced and sung by idena menzel glee enchanted their acting talents provide the perfect combination of what sisters can be really like now add an obnoxious duke who wants nothing more than to overrun these two sisters kingdom who is voiced by alan tudyk firefly wreck it ralph and a foreign prince named hans who is voiced by santino fontana submissions only royal pains who has his own agenda of a sort and you have a wonderfully well thought out film with some scary and very happy moments now you always need a hero and i wont spoil who the actual hero is in this film but banded with a series of well caricatured trolls an ice selling character named kristoff voiced and sung by artistically jonathan groff glee the good wife a wonderfully creative snowman named olaf perfected voiced by josh gad the internship and a reindeer named sven with a slight attitude and you have some wildly wintery fun all through the movie with music by christopher beck pitch perfect the internship and lyrics by kristine anderson lopez winnie the pooh and robert lopez avenue q winnie the pooh there is a wonderful broadway style showstopper type song sung by idena called let it go that will amaze you she sings it as she realizes her choices and destiny never matched and as she transforms into the snow queen the art and colors will overwhelm you especially her dress another fun song comes from olaf called in the summer which will have you laughing out loud because olaf dreams of sunning on the beach remember hes a snowman the puns and fun lyrics continue in many of the memorable songs including the two sisters beautiful duet for the first time in forever and the prince and annas comical song love is an open door the production and artistic design in this film is amazing and magically brought to the screen by designer michael giaimo pocahontas christmas is here again while the entire color scheme and overall visual effects were perfect orchestrated by steve goldberg tangled fanatasia this film has a much more real story and drama dealing with the two sisters and it is sprinkled with some very funny humor throughout a great family film for the season and much more engaging than disneys brave several years back with the music thrown in with great care like disneys more popular and entertaining the princess and the frog frozen is sure to be a family favorite as it teaches everyone what a true loving sacrifice is all about you should go see it with your family and your friends 
blu ray disc has the best picture and sound i have ever seen and heard frozen in my top collection of great films songs uplifting graphics perfect colors tell a story on their own characters full of character humor to die laughing story so original curveball ending movie that touches all emotions a complete package first tangled and wreck it ralph and now frozen hope its not strikes and out cant wait for next title from disney 
this movie probably designed for children has a strong message for adults i have used lines and situations from the movie in teaching adults and children having grandchildren around ive had the opportunity to watch it multiple times i suugest that you do the same 
the thing i loved about this movie is that it wasnt your average disney movie this movie had humor and plot twists unlike past disney movies that ive seen besides a voice cameo by john goodman which lets face it hes pretty amazing and i could never say anything bad about him all of the other actors arent well known voices which made the movie unique this was an animated musical unlike others of this time ill admit i was reluctant to see it but it didnt take me more than minutes before i was very interested in the movie and the plot great movie 
my seven year old grandson had me in tears as he told me he loved to sing along he says it doesnt matter whether its a girl movie or not he loved it we sing the songs together every time we watch 
i had taken my grand daughter to see this in the movies i enjoyed it so much that i knew id have to pre order it as with all disney movies there is an underlying theme that teaches children an important life lesson in this movie they learned to be proud of who they are and their abilities best of all its all set to extremely memorable music a winner all around 
yes we loved it and yes we will watch it again and again the songs grab you and stay with you all day and in my case at night going to sleep 
so we got this i have to say the blu ray has held up well to repeat viewings makes me wish for the good old days of vhs when you got a minute break while the tape rewound be warned if you buy this you will be forced to watch it everyday all day for weeks and weeks on end all in all stars would buy again 
ive heard about how great the music was i must say i feel a bit differently about that i cried all the way through this movie the music helped turn me into tears even before she began to sing im not saying the song is awful but if you have had a hurt in your life that youve never gotten over this movie will effect you as it did me dont watch it with p m s either 
my favorite disney movie to come out in quite some time wonderful story line lots of music lots of fun we love frozen 
i am singing as i write this review finally a disney movie that has brought back the magic of the older disney movies my daughter loved to sing with ariel bellle now my grand daughters are singing with elsa anna how my heart soars 
i think that frozen is a great animated movie well in line with the visual and storytelling style that disney has been experimenting with at least since tangled i have seen several negative reviews here on amazon com and while they have a point id like to point out that your perception of frozen and ultimately whether you love it or hate it will depend a lot on your initial expectations many websites that review frozen or have a description of the cartoon state that this animated cartoon is loosely based on h c andersens the snow queen this is not really so the correct way to put it would be that the story is inspired by the snow queen not based on it if you watch frozen expecting to see a more or less faithful animated version of the snow queen as written by hans christian andersen youll be sorely disappointed and this is where the cartoon gets a good deal of flak from when it comes to negative reviews this is a different original story set in a different place and written with different characters in mind so there is no kai gerda or even the snow queen as you know her from andersens story there are only a few parallels here to the original snow queen the most obvious one being the fact that one of the main characters elsa has snow based magical powers however neither elsa nor anna nor the other characters in frozen were the participants of the original andersens story and the plot line was certainly drastically different from what we see in frozen as such like i said watching frozen and expecting the snow queen is a wrong idea and it will only lead to disappointment however in its own right frozen is a wonderful cartoon with an interesting plot line and character interactions with some interesting and funny twists on such canon elements of many fairy tales as true loves kiss and marrying the man you just met enchanted anyone the characters are beautifully modeled in the style that resembles tangled the most out of all cartoons some models i believe might have been reused in a modified way such as the horse s but thats not a bad thing in my opinion frozen is one of the most musical cartoons ive ever seen i think it has more songs than tangled used to have at least that was my impression and i have to say the songs are stunningly beautiful and performed with operatic techniques that many operettas and musicals benefit from on a regular basis in the best disney style frozen is both touching and humorous at the same time and overall a lot of fun to watch definitely worth watching in movie theaters while its still there and then buying on dvd bluray so to sum it up a great disney movie definitely among my top favorites from the current gen disney animated work along with tangled and wreck it ralph just make sure you watch it as a separate original story in itself and you shouldnt be disappointed as long as you like disneys work of late in general 
i really loved the story and of course the animation was on point as always but i really loved the way it dealt with the love story true love rarely happens in one day and to show why it often doesnt was great i like how more of these fairy tails are being brought down to earth when it comes to love great movie 
disney has really upped their game great songs very catchy still doing the princess thing but this time with sisters i didnt think id like the snowman but i do i think this will go down as one of disneys best offerings the previews didnt do it justice i just hope the wonderful songs dont get old by overkill 
love the graphics love the story can see why it won the big one for animated movie of the year 
this movie is one of the most fantastic disney movies ever made i would recommend his one to all the disney folk and loves to see magic and singing i do recommend this movie i really really loved it 
will this be released in d adds so much to the films fabulousness if that word is not in use i think it should be 
i loved this movie didnt expect to but i did disney at its best and im years young 
i do not want to give away any parts of the movie i am a kindergarten teacher and after hearing my kids singing the main song from this movie and talking constantly about olaf i had to see the movie i first rented it through amazon and after watching it the first time i went ahead and ordered the movie disney really outdid themselves this time it is not one of those disney movies that are just for kids but for all ages it is a great movie and everyone should at least give it a shot 
i really thought this film had surprises and great music i loved the little sister she was a cracker in the vein of brave i thought the reindeer totally stole the screen watch him not the snowman hes hilariously drawn into predicaments that you wont notice if you arent watching i wont do a spoiler but i saw it coming a mile away though not everyone did i can see why it appealed to all audiences 
i actually took forever to sit down and watch this movie but when i heard it came out everyone said it was awesome and a really good movie although kinda sad i now had a chance and i cried like a baby like every mins but there were a lot of parts i smiled or laughed i was shocked at the over all depth of the story characters and even the songs i dont normally like songs and even when i was growing up as a kid sometimes they were annoying the songs were very well sung not just that there was a good quality to them that wasnt cheesy and was actually meaningful which was why i gave it stars i love kids movies but by god this was one of the best of them id ever seen i was surprised at how the two main characters were able to save the day and it didnt rely on a man like the old fashion stories i honestly was blown away i think anyone should watch this movie at least once kid or adult seriously its that good 
i actually have the d version of this which i bought through amazon uk the d animation is beautiful the film is based on the snow queen by hans christian anderson for some reason disney doesnt think theres much of a market for d animation here in the states it was a mistake to test this hypothesis on this film good musical featuring the powerful voice of idina menzel your kids will love olaf the snowman and sven the reindeer if you can get the d version or in any case just get it youll treasure it for years to come especially at holiday time 
this is by far the movie in our house right now it elicits singing pretend princess games silent movie watching and the story seems to really resonate a true disney classic
growing up in the disney renaissance age little mermaid beauty and the beast etc i have high expectations for disney movies frozen is a great movie but i feel it falls a bit short of tangled little mermaid etc it is however better than brave and the princess and the frog in my opinion and my daughters there are a few interesting twists in this movie namely having two princesses instead of just one and the ending which i wont spoil but will say is a great twist on an interpretation of true love the animation is spectacular and there are a few good songs especially let it go and do you want to build a snowman kristen bell does a fantastic job of voicing anna i had no idea she could sing as well as she does and idina menzel was great as elsa the snowman olaf provided comic relief but as an adult i found him a bit annoying at times the trolls in the story were a bit odd but served a purpose i suppose overall i would say that i definitely plan on purchasing this movie when it releases on dvd and would recommend it to anyone who is a disney fan the story songs characters and animation are wonderful and it is more memorable than some other disney films 
engaging characters interesting story fabulous music even though animated adults as well as kids will love this totally surprised me 
no one will likely forget the voice of idina menzel with the flub at the academy awards her portrayal of elsa the princess who became a queen the joy of the music in this film is just glorious it is overpowering at times but when i hear all the four year olds in my granddaughters class sing the song let it go you realize what an impact this film has on our children the age old quest for young children and in particular girls to love and support each other is given first place in this film elsa and anna sisters torn apart because of elsas strange powers to turn things into ice it is not until get are adults that they also come to understand that secrets are harmful and that the love of family is most important the film work is spectacular and gorgeous the music an extravaganza do sound the animated characters come alive and my gap favorite is olaf the storyline is superb and this film is certainly one of disneys best my year liked granddaughter and i just loved it highly recommended prisrob 
nice story beautiful animation and olaf character is soooo adorable and very positive watched together with my grandson we enjoyed very much 
i am a disney classics fan i enjoy the blend of good songs story and animation this film could not have been better the music score and vocals were great the animation incredible the story was even better in fact every time i watch it again with my children i pick up on something else i missed there is a lot of forshadowing and hidden treasures within the songs and dialog i easily bonded with the characters and enjoyed this film from beginning to end a timeless disney classic that will last the ages 
i loved this film it takes the classic tale by hans christian anderson and updates it with state of the art d animation that truly is magnificent the ice castle created by elsa aka the snow queen is an elaborate form of imagery that exudes elegance the tale takes a creative leap from the original but still centers on the struggle between good and evil and in the end we learn how love overcomes the most dire circumstances there are some scenes which may be too frightening to your younger viewers such as the giant snow monster the queen creates to guard her castle but for the most part this is a tale to be shared with your younger children and even pre teens will enjoy it particularly the imagery youth comments i expected the movie to be kind of like tangled with a main plot and a long long quest well i was almost right frozen is a great movie the whole family should see the movie has so much to love comedy romance adventure suspense thrillers fantasy and so so much more it also teaches us a valuable lesson of not being afraid to show who we are and put our powers to a good use the fun starts when two young royal sisters get into an accident one has a magical power to summon ice the magical girl hits her little sister anna she lives but has no memory of the magic and does not see her sister for many years when anna finally gets to see her sister it turns into a tragedy the animation is so adorable and fitting for the actors they play the voices very well the two sisters anna kristen bell and elsa idina menzel sound so much alike the other actors like josh gad do fantastic as well the film flows very nicely too the graphics and animation look unbelievably real my favorite scene is when elsa the one with powers runs away and builds her own ice castle she is also my favorite character because she tries to protect her sister but keeps messing up at it the castle is built very nicely and it shows her true powers of being the snow queen i wouldnt mind living in a castle like that myself if you know what i mean since the movie is so kind bright and educational i recommend it to ages and give it out of stars reviewed by gerry o kids first film critic
frozen is without a doubt the best disney animated film ever made the animation is excellent the music phenomenal and the special effects unparalleled even the soundtrack produced from the movie is fantastic kids of all ages both male and female love this movie my daughter and son ages and and my nephews ages and are no exception this family friendly movie encompasses a lesson of love family loyalty and trust this family friendly movie is appropriate for viewers of all ages and is sure to appeal to both young and old our whole family loves this movie and its one that we watch over and over this two disc blu ray dvd digital copy is the perfect combination as we can watch it the blu ray disc which provides the best viewing quality on our player at home while my children are able to watch the dvd and digital copy when traveling using their portable dvd players 
if you are completely fascinated with stories about snow and ice then you will adore this movie it is really more about two sisters finding happiness than romance although there is plenty of that too what i like is that the prince is not charming and the regular guy gets the girl the little snowman is adorable and the reindeer is pretty cute too and sometimes acts more like a dog my favorite part of the movie was when the gifted troubled sister makes a magical ice castle this of course has a happy ending for everyone this is a movie i could watch again and again it really is that good the rebecca review
i had to see this movie after it won the oscar for best animated film i was very surprised how much i enjoyed it and was even more impressed that it was based on the story the snow queen i saw televised play of the story when i was kid and it stuck with me i really loved this disney adaptation 
the music and beautiful story of two sisters love and acceptance will pull you in immediately strong female roles and a big push to send a message that true love doesnt happen overnight and that family is the most important thing 
my kids love this movie the music is particularly special and my daughter sings let it go all the time 
the song of course drives the movie but i was surprised just how good the movie is it is easy to see how it will become a stage production the movie has those values which is unusual in an animated feature it was interesting to research just how let it go drove the development of the movie and rightly so i had tried several times to understand the plot development and failed but it comes together in the movie this is a must for anyone who loves great musicals its not just for kids 
since our van has two dvd players but no blu ray player i bought the dvd version it is stunningly beautiful and because of the crispness of the digital animation it looks just as fabulous the movie itself is classic disney with lots of fun and action but also with the formula dark side of the story only to build up to a happy ending who could ask for anything more 
the title says it all i rented this movie on netflix com in early may and after seeing it for the st time i thought now i know why this movie got so many good reviews from critics did extremely well at the box office with the exception of two characters the duke of weselton prince hans i loved everything about this movie i loved the remaining characters especially elsa anna olaf kristoff and sven the plot of the movie where elsa has this special power to create ice snow but shes unable to control it and sets off an eternal winter in the town of arendelle the settings of the movie especially elsas ice palace the town of arendelle itself the soundtrack especially the songs let it go which i have memorized by heart for the first time in forever do you want to build a snowman i also like when elsas singing let it go she changes from her coronation dress to the beautiful ice dress that she wears for the rest of the movie i especially like the message that the movie delivers in that an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart when anna sacrifices herself to save elsa from being killed by hans and that elsa realizes that love is how she can control her powers thaw the city so i recommend this movie to anyone who loves disney movies computer animated films or just movies in general because believe me it is wonderful 
 frozen is certainly one of my new favorite disney movies although that may not be that selective of a group in my opinion disney film animation is at its best when it is doing it s best and that s musical fairy tales just like they have taken quite a few liberties with the source material before the same is the case here with the original hans christian andersen story the snow queen being present in only the barest sense but that hardly matters at all because this film is a delight from beginning to end however this film is not without its own disney clich eacute s either we have two princesses now but also cue the dead king and queen still this film does its best to break as many conventional molds as it can queen elsa does not need nor even desire a charming prince to save her the romance here is reserved for her younger sister anna who is adorably nave and hilarious in her own right with her reactions there is a degree of self awareness on disney s part in that particular aspect almost in a self parodying manner similar to that in enchanted the twist at the end concerning the villain was unexpected enough to legitimately surprise me and in a good way it can drag for a bit towards the end and it overall has a problem depicting the passage of time well but that doesn t take away from the warm experience that frozen delivers the comic relief characters the animal and the goofball olaf were not as annoying as i might have expected from the promotional material quite the contrary actually they are both a delight and that little snowman should replace frosty as the definitive jolly happy soul in a package of human shaped frozen water as expected of a disney film much of this film s charm and success are closely tied the music in a move that i greatly appreciate and seems to be recurring more with this studio as of late all of the voice actors also do their own singing if i recall correctly both tangled and the princess and the frog also did this but not since beauty and the beast had it been done before that at any rate this cast is wonderful in particular kristen bell has as much innocence and charm to her singing as jodie benson and paige o hara and of course idina menzel has proven herself to be in a class all her own she delivers in all the best senses of that word this film s killer single let it go which has become so popular in such a short amount of time i doubt i need to elaborate much on it needless to say it resonates strongly with anyone who hasn t fit in at some point in their lives which is pretty much everyone and is now as iconic as under the sea for the first time in forever also hits several emotional points wonderfully its own belle that s fantastic the first few stanzas of do you want to build a snowman are so overly cute they will probably give you diabetes this is not to say however that the soundtrack is all hits there are a couple of misses kristoff s bit is creepier than it is endearing the opening song about ice is as forgettable as that sounds and the trolls song towards the end is kind of stupid overall whatever very minor faults this film has doesn t detract from the fact that this is a modern instant classic frozen will go down in disney history has great and as iconic as anything from its renaissance era or the golden age no one can go wrong with this film as children and adults of all ages will absolutely adore it as i do basically if you don t like this film it is you who has a cold heart 
the story is good and the little snowman is the funniest sidekick in a while i am only writing more because i have to 
borrowing more than a little inspiration from the monstrous success of broadways wicked wherein two very different sisters play out their conflicts in technicolor and with magic frozen is both a throwback to the classic disney animated features and a smart newfangled creation that surprises you at nearly every turn the score by the lopez duo who brought us some of book of mormon and avenue q is broadway ready with a sensational centerpiece in the gorgeous and thrilling let it go as sung by idina menzel yes elphaba in the original wicked it is a spine tingling anthem about well just being yourself olaf the snowman offers an adorable jolt of humor that feels organic and not forced think shrek the d version i saw surrounds you with snow and ice and had me reaching for my scarf the script allows you to be drawn in like all of the best stories rather than clobbering you over the head its a fantastic movie treat for everyone 
i dont think i need to tell everyone at this stage of the frozen game that the music is superb the graphics are superb the story is superb and it is a whole lot of fun as a grownup or as a kid or a teen though they dont admit it you will adore this film 
im surprised at the negative reviews for this film i truly wonder what some folks want to see its a great film and a great experience like all disney films the story is based on a complete trashing of a classic fairy tale in this case the snow queen i hope it inspires people to actually read the classic a few things stand out from this film vice its contemporaries the animation is mostly superb i was impressed with the characterizations in tangled but this surpasses them ive yet to see any better character animation in an animated feature its truly a marvel to watch on that level alone the one drawback is the background computer modeling some were definitely created by a team that either had far less talent or was in a big big hurry to get the production finished i doubt most folks will notice it but it stood out to me its not bad enough to take a star away the music is also top rate let it go is a terrific sequence both in storyline and in the song itself in fact i place it at the level of under the sea be our guest and i just cant wait to be king for animated music hits once you see the sequence youll know why also the sound mixing is likely the best ive experienced in a long while we watched this with a high grade system faking the sides and it was flawless very deep sound placement and the best of levels at the best of times really a remarkable job my other praise lies in the underlying theme of the film rather than following the classic save by the prince mantra which is contained in the film the real message is that girls need to be confident in themselves and be who they really are rather than pretend to be something theyre expected to be i found that to be a very promising message for young girls consequently i highly recommend this film for anyone who has daughters or granddaughters 
a home run by disney beware when shown to children they will want to see it multiple times and girls will be assuming character roles it is well worth having and seeing 
fantastically refreshing movie that my daughter and i loved loved loved i was surprised by how much the story of elsa and anna and how the whole movie was about their relationship rather than around a romance there were a couple of scenes where i thought oh no it s going to be a romantic love story in the vein of cinderella love at first sight etc but thankfully disney turned that on its head and i didn t have to worry about my daughter getting any wildly unrealistic notions of true love because of this movie i also love the underlying message of embracing one s self and turning doubt and insecurity into strength a theme that is stirringly evident in let it go my daughter loves this song and i do too it s funny because i ve passed teenage girls singing it to themselves and it tickles me because it has such an amazing message 
this is the story of two sister one an optimist and one fearful s who are forced apart by circumstances in the end it is their love for each other that resolves the problems life brings them one of the strongest scores ever in a disney movie we went out and bought the music the day after seeing the movie in the theater the oscars for this movie are well deserved 
idina menzel gave concerts in chicago ravinia and milwaukee performing arts center shortly before the appearance of frozen i was given a front row ticket to the milwaukee concert and was struck above all by the numerous young people college age and slightly older who were obviously familiar with practically every sung word eagerly joining menzel on stage upon being invited to perform numbers from recent broadway musicals rent wicked as a jazz fan and musician i must admit the music wasnt my bag with the exception of avenue q which knocked me out to my ears most popular songs of the past years sounds infinitely inferior to the music of jerome kern showboat rodgers and hammerstein oklahoma gershwin porgy and bess rodgers and hart on your toes cole porter anything goes bernstein and sondheim west side story in terms of structural integrity melodic inventiveness lyric wit and range and depth of emotional expression perhaps the reason these are the songs that constitute the library that has come to be known as the great american songbook in any case my opinions were rendered meaningless by the profound effect this movie had on my year old grand daughter although i didnt observe much of a response from her at the theater either during or immediately following the movie a mere months later shes singing every single note every word of the score of frozen i couldnt even tell you the name of the composer lyricist granted in that time shes had a birthday but im no less impressed and its quite apparent that this blockbuster out of the disney studios is having a similar impact on thousands of other children of all ages the tunes from frozen and for that matter most other recent musicals dont lend themselves to jazz improvisation but neither does much operatic music only the passage of time will tell us whether this music will endure like kerns all the things you are or johnny greenes body and soul or harold arlens somewhere over the rainbow to name just a few examples of classic american tunes that are part of an inarguable canon of american popular song but ill be far more hesitant about criticizing it and even if it eventually sinks into the oblivion of so much pop emphemera a musical like frozen leads in a musical direction thats considerably more professional and sophisticated than the folk rock and country music mostly by guitar playing singer songwriters that has dominated american popular music since the s come to think of it menzel exhibited a broadway voice that was not all that unlike ethel mermans minus the vibrato ethel was the favorite of the early great composers because of her power and elocution both essential to broadway shows before the development of the microphone which was not even a factor in vocal performances until the late s and the emergence of the creative genius who knew to use it bing crosby near the beginning of practically any course that i teach literature music and film i warn my youthful troops learning is a risky adventure that they all possess a bias against anything that is perceived as old past before their time and that one of their greatest challenges will be to surmount their pre existing bias in favor of the modern or contempotrary for education which means moving out of restrictive confines to occur education is more about covering epochs of time in teaching linguistics i endeavor to go back some million years than vast expanses of space traveling even in outer space is of great interest and even a potentially transformative experience for some yet its extremely limited compared to the traveling in time that is possible only through the study of texts from the past in other words theyd better be prepared to read and have an open mind to a lot of dead white guys not excluding some black ones like louis armstrong and duke ellington both of whom produced music that resonates in consciousness with the creative brilliance of a shakespeare sonnet or a homeric epic poem already as a teacher student ive no doubt alienated myself from not only some of those present bound youth that occupy my classroom but from of the narrow minded and rigid americans on the far right who have condemned frozen as a propaganda piece supporting modern liberal notions such as women who can overcome formidable obstacles and attain the kind of powerful automony we like to see in our great national leaders were told that such empowerment of women defies all of the patriarchal examples of the past not to mention the teachings of the bible and other religious texts moreover were told that by showing us two women who are capable of loving above all each other frozen is brainwashing our youth into approving of homosexuals if not becoming one who would have thunk it i confess these ideas never occurred to me until i bagan reading and hearing reports about the controversy stirred up by this movie which had initially left me largely indifferent and about poorer it occurs to me that we can all learn from these alarmists as the vert antithesis of a genuine student with a mind open to learning rather than learning how to interpret a text literary film musical etc theyre hardened idealogues who have become all too well practiced in their habitual litmus tests i e witch hunts i encourage them all to take a few classes in higher learning for their own good and the communities they attempt to serve in the meantime im enjoying my grand daughters extended arias recitatives lifted from the soundtrack of frozen and being sung with such joyful abandon and power mostly on pitch that i can feel my houses foundation moving and witness my cats frozen in trepidation as they cling to their preferred perches in the four story trees ordered from amazon its enough proof for me to conclude my grand child who had just recently conquered the potty was indeed liberated and at the age of who knows where shell go from here im simply relieved to know that she wont have limits placed upon her by some perhaps well intentioned by sadly misinformed hard liner if you wish to learn about music you might do well to talk to and hang out with a musican if you want to learn about morality the last person to consult is a moralist 
this movie is presented very nicely for children and adults there are some very nice messages in thismovie nice music
a must see for anyone who likes disney or not completely different then anything they have ever done definitely my favorite disney movie and also my girls are always singing the songs 
animation is awesome storyline is awesome music is totally out of this world and straight into your living room may they continue to bring this level or better to the big and small screen 
a movie come along for kids that has such a strong positive message my middle daughter wanted to see this i on the other hand was expecting another disney princess movie how wrong i was this movie is absolute perfection the music in the movie is quite addicting and purchased the cd within a week after seeing this i purchased the blu ray dvd combo pack at target and we have watched it several times this movie gets in your head even when i am not watching it i keep hearing elsas let it go being sung by my ear worm sometimes he does give me a break but wow disney and pixar really made a movie that i am so proud that will be part of my childrens generation 
i have enjoyed almost all of the movies made by disney but this i believe is the best of a wonderful series of fairy tales spanning decades that have given so many families the joy of innocence and love the love and concern that the two sisters show for each other is very touching so few movies show how important it is for family and friends to make sacrifices for each other and this does so brilliantly if only these values could be incorporated into all of our children it would certainly make for a better world 
i went to the theater expecting the usual dumb kids movie and was blown away i loved this film and instantly added the dvd to my wishlist honestly my favorite movies are the hunt for the red october galaxy quest pixars incredibles princess bride ponyo sound of music and lord of the rings extended editions i gravitate to no particular genre but only to what i find are the absolute best movies frozen is up there with the best movies i have ever seen period why is this film so good it teaches real love love is about putting the other persons needs first love is shown in your actions not your words i am so floored that a kids movie actually taught this and even took the time to point out you never get engaged or married to a guy you just met wow a disney film not about being swept off your feet by a guy in seconds its about time the side kick characters are not annoying seriously its like the difference between jar jar binks and r d these side kicks are more like r d whereas past disney sidekicks were like jar jar binks these side kicks from the reindeer to snow monster were done exactly right they add humor to the show and dimension without ever getting in the way of the story or you wanting to strangle them way to go disney any way you can retroactively edit sidekicks in older films the plot themes are serious yet with enough humor that it doesnt feel too serious and without the humor taking away from the story line what a great balance to hit just right ok so the story line is a bit simplistic because its a kid movie but it still has twists and turns i did not find the story predictable because i was expecting another one of those princesses falling in love movies and this was not typical the story teaches important themes like what love really is the weight of responsibility how to use power rightly vs wrongly and empathy for others great music the opening song grabs you and whisks you away to another world every song helps you connect more deeply to each character and pulls you deeper into the story i have never felt so much empathy in a musical since fiddler on the roof and im not that emotional of a person so if you have daughters grandchildren nieces or work in childcare get this movie you will be able to watch it over and over without going insane the kids will learn what true love really is and what to watch out for in love its not what all those other princess movies teach so you can rest easy 
frozen theatrical review as animated features go disney is tops unlike the morality tales of pixar films which i do love that s no insult on them frozen goes a step back to a more traditional method of storytelling like sleeping beauty or snow white frozen takes us through a story of love of betrayal and of family i m sure sisters have felt shut out by their fellow siblings this film does reflect that it also tells us not to rush into anything like marriage as that person could really be a wolf in sheep s clothing the characters are developed well in this story of two sisters elsa the young and feisty one and anna the magic one whose powers of ice and snow make her consider herself a freak with a curse their ups downs in relationships between each other and the love they have for each other is quite a change from the usual boy meets girl prince charming style of disney films the music is fresh and original the film plays like a musical and most of the themes deal with tackling life head on and not be dissuaded from your goals and purposes the story is inspired from hans christian anderson s tale of the snow queen the theater version starts with a short that plays like an old walt disney s style black white cartoon but then morphs into a modern story with plenty of slapstick great start i really liked the snow queen who hurt her sister and did not want a repeat of that but thought protecting her by not revealing herself she actually hurt her sister emotionally and the younger one was shut out i m sure kids will relate to this bottom line if you love castles dancing some comedy relief and some traditional disney style look no further than frozen even olaf the snowman was a trip the special effects were excellent the detail down to the fibers of cloth and the features of stone and design were amazing highly recommended cast kristen bell l anna voice idina menzel elsa voice jonathan groff kristoff voice josh gad olaf voice santino fontana hans voice 
this is an excellent product the quality of the images and d is outstanding the price was very high well above the pre order price of the us frozen d that was cancelled i hated having to go overseas to get what should have been available from disney in america but the quality of the images on this makes it worth it the other thing is that the magic code with it cannot be used in the usa the cancellation of this product in america brings up a lot of questions that disney should answer 
i came into the theatre with average expectations when i left i was amazed i never expected it to be in my top animated films along with the lion king and the castle of cagliostro as i want this review to be spoiler free to encourage people to see for themselves all i can say is that ive never seen such chemistry drama and comedy working well in a d animated film in my opinion it is the single greatest princess movie disney has ever made which should tell you that you cant afford to miss this film its probably the best film ive seen all year 
i had heard this was a good movie so i bought it i absolutely love it i was telling my daughter and her husband about it and she had heard it was fantastic also my year old grandson had a friend over who had seen it and he was saying how much he enjoyed it i didnt think year old boys would like it we had a great conversation about it and i cant wait to take it over for my daughters family to watch totally worth if you havent seen it get it its great for adults and children watching and hearing the ice crack is so real buy it thanks 
the message music and art work were great the characters voices were perfect and everyone i know who saw it loved it 
like most parents in america at this point im about ready to bury this disc in the back yard never to be found again that being said judging the movie on its merits rather than how worn out it is it really is a very good piece of work pretty easily the best non pixar disney film in a long long time has pretty much everything a good disney musical should great music comedy adventure romance 
great disney film for all ages near perfect casting great script music and lyrics i grew up during disneys golden years and saw the lion king aladdin etc in theaters this movie is just as good if not more so than those i tend to enjoy disneys new strong female leads and hope to see more of them will watch this movie for years to come 
i love this disney animated movie i think it is the best since beauty and the beast disney has several good animated movies since then but beauty and the beast was nominated for best picture that year before the academy develop the best animation picture it ranks very high for me and anybody who has seen it my neice told me how good it was and she is yrs old 
a household favorite i let my toddler watch a video at night at before she gets ready for bed this has been in our dvd player since the day it arrived she loves it and so do i normally when shes watching a movie i use that time to pick up around the house not with this movie i get everything done before the movie starts so i can watch it with her keep in mind its still a disney story so there are the signature elements of fairy tales princesses and the quest for love however the story line is well written and much more modern for the times disney is maturing in their character growth subject matter and tone this is the epitome of an animated musical the songs are catchy my daughter is and she loves to run all over the house singing let it go and knows the words almost verbatim elsa is the oldest sister born with the power to freeze what she touches she and anna were close in their youth until one day elsa struck her with her powers while they were playing elsa was isolated from anna by their parents and anna never understood why and has been trying to reconnect with elsa from that day forward three years after their parents pass away remember its disney elsa becomes queen after her coronation thats when the true grit of the movie begins disney really did a wonderful job capturing the attention of all ages in this story i feel for elsa while most think shes the villain but youll have to watch and find out for yourself anna is lonely growing up in the castle without having much contact with her big sister she cant wait for her sisters coronation because the gates will finally reopen and shell have contact with actual people for the first time in years the characters introduced later kristoff and his reindeer sven prince hans olaf the snowman the trolls and the other minor characters that come and go throughout the movie make this one of the best disney films ive ever seen disney will always have their classics like little mermaid cinderella etc but this next generation of disney films seems to be a power house in the making this movie was entertaining compelling and an easy to story to get lost in well done disney looking forward to what lies ahead 
okay as i figured there are already reviews posted on amazon for frozen i wanted to point out that amazon has a policy of grouping all reviews of all formats of a film together under each version so you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical version here as well as review of the amazon instant version neither of these covers the bonus features on the dvd and bluray so i always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by most recent first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing with that said on to the bluray combo pack frozen is loosely based on a hans christian andersen fairy tale but it s been brought very much up to date yes there is a villain actually only one though the villain i won t give a spoiler here has a some accomplices but it s not who you think it is and that makes this different from many disney films also the cgi animation is not like little mermaid or even toy story it s well different with the non humans having a lot more detail than their human characters the music is great some of the best disney in recent years and the humorous supporting characters are downright hilarious i loved it and i m in my s the special features are somewhat space compared with recent disney bds but what is here is great first there is the totally unrelated new mickey mouse cartoon get a horse which just won an oscar it s a wonderful use of black and white and color it runs about minutes next is the making of frozen which is only minutes long but it s hysterical i can t tell you why again it ll spoil the fun but it s unlike any other making of featurette you ve seen on a dvd or bd there are minutes of deleted scenes with commentary and another featurette of similar length about how the film compares to the hc andersen original then there are the music videos in about languages including malaysian the film itself runs minutes but the last minutes consists of the credits lots of folks worked on their pcs on this film so there s a bit over hours of fine entertainment in the package i hope you found this review both informative and helpful steve ramm anything phonographic 
pixars loss of john lasseters direct involvement in their day to day operations hasnt done them any favors see my reviews of monsters university and brave however his influence on disney as a whole looks to be unmistakable unmistakably good at that whereas the last couple of pixar movies have descended to fairly typical disney fare frozen rises towards the kind of film we havent seen from pixar since toy story a movie that made me cry and i dont cry at movies very often its not as good as ts but its definitely the best disney animation movie in a good long while in an effort to avoid spoilers ill just say that the movie is delightful on so many levels olaf steals every scene hes in and my kids loved him seriously my daughter especially has not stopped talking about him and both of the younger ones have been singing as much of his puddle song as they can remember my daughter who is less interested in movies than the boys would have turned right around and seen it again the animation in the movie was in a word incredible especially the ice and especially especially the ice bridge the songs are good and who knew kristen bell could sing okay so well maybe lots of people but i didnt know so i was surprised to see that she had performed her own songs and as ive already implied the song by olaf was really catchy the best parts of the movie however cant be talked about without being spoilery youve been warned the death of the parents at the beginning of the movie is pretty typical for disney im not quite sure why all of their young heroes have to be orphans of some type but its almost always the case possibly for frozen its there to help you feel as if youre in a typical disney film i kind of doubt it but whatever the reason you know when the parents are leaving on their trip that theyre not coming back of course thats what sets up the problems for the rest of the movie elsa has no one to help her cope with her powers and grows up in isolation because of it one of the best moments is between anna and kristoff as he chastises her for attempting to marry someone hans that she had just met that day its very amusing because the immediate true love thing is so endemic in disney movies so its refreshing to see it handled like this in this movie in fact the catalyst of the whole thing is elsa now the queen refusing to allow the marriage between anna and hans because they had only just met theres even a comment from kristoff to anna where he is saying no to her about something no i dont remember exactly what because he doesnt trust her judgement all of this is a nice break from that disney cliche and then theres the whole thing with true loves kiss that they also turn on its head and that was great to see too and i wont say more than that because i dont want to give everything away lets just say that the movie ended with both anna and elsa growing as characters something that brave unfortunately lacked at any rate its a very enjoyable movie and one that i hope is signaling a new direction for disney disney princesses are great and all that but its good to have some that dont need to get rescued also alan tudyk was great i didnt even realize that was him until i saw his name in the credits hes a great voice actor and under appreciated as an actor in general 
i will add to the review pile for frozen i went in half expecting this to just be another typical disney run of the mill movie that they have been doing lately but i was dead wrong has the feel of their older movies great songs and a wonderful story 
the beggining was a great intro it made a lot of sense and as the title says all of the songs are stuck in my head it deserved an award for the best disney movie and it also deserved the award best original song i think that it was a great film a sad and feel good film it was very moving and it was never really boring for kids because there was songs all the time i wouldnt be surprised if this movie became an on stage musical i reccomend all ages both girls and boys and musical peaople to go to this film if you havent watched it yet watch it p
it is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time it appeals to all age groups songs music is wonderful story line is good the beauty humor love tension all make this perfect love it 
we have the soundtrack on in our car this playing in our house and my daughter never tires of it it has two strong female leads tells kids that marrying somebody that you just met because its true love is a bad idea puts family before short ish relationships and is just fantastic overall i love the fixer upper song if i could give this stars or maybe million stars i would its a huge hit with my daughter 
if there is anyone with children that has not seen this movie yet i can definitely say buy it this is a big disney hit elsa and her younger sister anna are princesses in a scandinavian country there is something different about older sister elsa she has powers that are not understood she can turn things to ice after an accident her parents lock her away from her beloved younger sister spoiler alert in true disney fashion her parents are lost at sea and elsa is set to become queen there are always those who seek power for their own gain and this story runs true to that theme in this case there are two handsome men in younger sister annas life not to mention a lovable reindeer and a singing and dancing snowman named olaf elsa comes to terms with her gift and determines her own destiny and anna not needing a prince to rescue her ultimately rescues herself and most of them live happily ever after there is plenty here to keep all ages interested i was amazed that my year old granddaughter was captivated by the entire movie even to the point of bursting into spontaneous applause and never asked for a snack food run or bathroom stop once the movie started her papa who is not a big fan of cartoons liked it too idina menzel provides the voice for elsa and knocks it out of the park with the theme song let it go which im pretty sure everyone has heard by now all in all you cannot go wrong with this movie i dont think its my personal favorite overall but well worth buying and watching probably more than once i purchased this two disc version for my grandchildren so they would have one copy for the car and one for the house for my own house i just purchased the single disc version it is nice that amazon offers that option 
this is one of the best disney films in a long time i ordered the movie for my lil girl and i like that you get a digital copy as well we downloaded the digital copy to her ipad and we have the dvd thats a plus for a low price i have two daughters so the message in this movie is especially important to me i would recommend this movie to anyone as my teenage daughter and i enjoyed it too the price on amazon is worth it and the delivery was quick 
ive always been a sucker for disney yet this movie has everything kindness love humor the graphics are amazing 
purchased after rave reviews from christian parents pleased with its honorable theme of sacrificial giving disney probably did not make that their intent but it is a worthy idea for anyone trying to raise selfless children we also love musical theatre and high quality experiences for kids our grands have watched it a lot great purchase
we are two old foggies well in our s but enjoyed every moment of this film what a delight to see something to make us laugh and the music was wonderful it had us singing let it go thanks disney for a delightful evening 
this is an awesome movie the script was very rich and well developed the animation was amazing and an un disney like ending the movie focus on two princesses elsa and anna who are sisters for those sick of disney its here we go again the same story elsa is born with enormous powers over ice and snow while the younger is born completely normal in the beginning the two sisters are very close but drift apart after an accident while playing elsa accidentally strikes anna with her powers anna is revived and saved by a troll king but has no memory of elsas power and elsa is warned she needs to learn to control her powers as they will continue to grow and become more powerful as she grows their parents soon both die in an enormous storm at sea and elsa is coroneted queen bringing her out of her shell during the ceremonies anna falls for hans a visiting prince elsa doesnt approve of the match and in the resulting argument elsas powers are revealed and she flees the kingdom in exile elsa uses her powers to the fullest building herself an ice castle and becoming the snow queen anna then goes to retrieve her sister and end the winter teaming up with ice salesman kristoff and for the kids olaf the snowman the song i really liked was let it go which was sung by idina menzel while elsa is building her ice palace perfectly describes elsas feelings about her newfound freedom and her powers love is an open door and fixer upper wont become disney classics but they were well choreographed and helped to add to the storyline its funny all the way through the kids and adults will love and its a departure from the traditional disney princess especially with elsa who is more regal reserved and less adventurous than most of disneys other princesses its more about time and love rather finding your true love and rushing into marriage like most of disneys other classics the only complaint is that the script should have had more time to be explained it seemed they were trying to push it into an hour and minutes taking more minutes two hour would have made the movie a whole lot better but this will still be a movie that will stand the test of time 
 frozen is an animated feature film loosely based on the snow queen by hans christian andersen in typical disney manner the company has tweaked the story and eliminated most of the dark moments the disney version is about two princesses elsa the elder sister has the ability to shoot ice and snow from her hands as the girls grow up with plenty of broadway caliber songs along the way elsa voice of idina menzel comes to realize her magical powers can be a threat to those around her so she retreats from everyone including her sister princess anna kristen bell the metaphor is clear a person s own insecurities can freeze out loved ones as in the broadway musical wicked the dynamic that drives the story is the strained relationship between two girls frozen is among the best of disney s recent animated features it has a powerhouse score by husband and wife team robert and kristen anderson lopez including the academy award winning song let it go performed by ms menzel the song sequences are mini extravaganzas in themselves but rather than stop the action dead they move the story forward the sisters are distinctive and march to their own beat a theme that crops up a lot lately in animated films when anna meets a handsome mountain man jonathan groff and his reindeer sidekick she is conflicted by her attraction to this hunky dashing guy and an at home love interest hans santino fontana comic relief is amply supplied by olaf josh gad a chaplin esque anthropomorphic snowman the disc blu ray dvd combo pack contains deleted scenes a mickey mouse cartoon a making of short and a featurette showing the adaptation process from original fairy tale to screen 
great movie for girls or boys awesome for the family and not too long we saw it in the theater the first time 
so i have been hearing the music from frozen for months with my and year old daughters belting out some song from the movie every few minutes i knew there was snow in the movie and that a strange snowman would be in it somewhere i didnt see it in theaters when they went so i couldnt wait to watch the movie on blu ray seriously though i finally saw the movie and i am impressed overall i can see how it became an instant classic i like that the story isnt about princes and true love although there is romance in this its disney after all i was not surprised that once again the parents die that happens in almost every movie this studio puts out it seems its rare to have two parents for sure i will say that the plot works for kids but it jumps quickly from point to point as far as an adult goes this is geared towards kids after all but i was glad to finally see the movie and highly recommend it this movie has not scared either of our girls who are sometimes scared by movies now i have to go work on my lip sync routine for family frozen night 
if you enjoy disney movies music and or a wonderful message about love and family you owe it to yourself to watch this movie all i can say is frozen is one of the best movies ive ever seen from disney and that includes anything released by pixar the cast is incredible in their respective roles including kristen bell surprising in an amazing performance as princess anna and idina mendzel spelling continuing the mastery of her voice as queen elsa i took my children to see frozen twice in the theater and we just watched the amazon instant video tonight after viewings and many more if my kids have anything to say about it the movie is still tons of fun to watch 
really i got this for my girl friend she loves this movie and when i sat down to watch it with her i was blown away we dont have kids yet but adults will love this movie just the same the music the animation the way the characters have subtle movements like their shoulders bopping to the music just brought them more alive i was so impressed not to mention the story was so fun no real bad guy just the inner battles of themselves very well done 
finally disney has made something that reminds me of the good ole days of the little mermaid and the lion king ive seen it multiple times and i have no children both in d and blu ray the only complaint i have is that they dont really have any great extras included i was really looking forward to a making of and while it says its included its not i cant say much more than that without spoiling it i guess i just need to let it go 
i saw this movie twice in theaters first on its pre thanksgiving wednesday premiere and second for a friends holiday party and you know what this is the best animated movie of to me at least there was even a mickey mouse short before it called get a horse anna and olaf tied as my favorite character though for different reasons anna is beautiful and kind just like a good disney heroine should be but shes also fun cheerful innocent and very energetic shes also strong and feisty when she has to be so shes not weak she reminds me a lot of pinocchio in the good senses olaf is really funny when i saw this film for a second time i heard many people in the theater laughing at his funny moments kristoff is enjoyable to especially when he voices over sven elsa i have to admit is likable too she reminds me a lot of raven from teen titans shutting people out fearing her powers are dangerous needing private time the list goes on the musical numbers are enjoyable too much like lion king i dont feel like i have a particular favorite i just like them each for their own reasons i will say though in summer and fixer upper are the films funniest songs i also like how their is true love but shown in a different way sisterly love that we dont see too often in a disney fairy tale movie i dont know what else to say other than the fact that i really enjoyed this film i am positive frozen will entertain many generations of disney fans 
i dont know about you but i remember a time where disney reign supreme in the genre of animation classics like beauty and the beast aladdin and the lion king aw those were day these days on the other hand the animated trend of disney has died down yet when an animated film does pop up it can be a treat that brings us to latest animated disney feature frozen after the success of tangled frozen would be worked on the films creators and be another disney movie completely cg though tangled prove disney animation could be brought in a different light how does frozen fair in disneys long list of animated classics the tale of frozen deals with two princess anna kristen bell and elsa idina menzel while things have been peaceful in the kingdom arendelle there is a secret in the royal family elsa has the power to control ice after a dramatic situation elsas powers go out of control bringing an eternal winter to arendell anna journeys after elsa with the mountain man kristoff johnathan groff his trusty reindeer sven and a living snowman named olaf josh gad together the four journey into a wilderness so they can save kingdom as well as elsa while there are many classic disney films sometimes the films plot can be repetitive frozen on the other hand does not fall under such stereotypes thanks to the two plots of anna and elsa frozens plot was very refreshing plus the pacing of the story was great by making frozen an adventurous tale that really stood out with a great story came wonderful characters it almost hard to decide who was the superior character among the ensemble kristen bell brought a charismatic performance as anna while surprising me in other areas idina menzel brought her voice and belting ability as elsa who was just a different kind of disney princess i even liked kristoff and olaf and normally cant stand the generic male love interest and comedic relief on paper the cast to frozen didnt look like it was going to work yet in the end this ensemble was hard not to love to say frozens animation was great seems a little redundant seeing that disney film usually shine in this element but frozen has some wonderful animation what stands out in the animation is the use of the colors and lights this help thing such as the character stand out from the likes of tangleds cast along with the animation came the music the score by christophe beck was impressive and even more so was the fact that frozen was a musical speaking of musicals frozen has to be the one best disney musicals in a very long time the reason why the element work was because the movie treated itself like a broadway musical a rare feat even in disney films this is the point where i talked about which scenes stood out me in the case of frozen the moments that stood out to me were the musical numbers the big songs first time in forever and let it go were great first time in forever was a fantastic title song giving us great moments between anna and elsa plus the sound was soothing then there was elsas big song let it go the song was catchy and just great for the character i am willing to bet that these songs will be remember in the years to come if you havent guessed yet i liked frozen the film was a treat for families and fans of both animation and disney with a compelling story memorable character and the broadway atmosphere frozen is indeed a hit this film is not just one of the best of the year but it is one the best disney for quite sometime see review here 
princesses elsa and anna are sisters and best friends until elsas power over ice and snow gets away from her and she hurts anna elsa completely pulls away locking herself away from the world and working to control her powers by suppressing her emotions their parents downsize the staff and close the gates to arendelle to reduce the danger elsa poses to others anna feels abandoned and both girls feel utterly alone years later their parents die in a boating accident making elsa the queen of arendelle she is forced to open the gates and hold a coronation celebration the coronation goes well but her powers are revealed after a heated argument with anna she runs away leaving a wake of ice and snow making the much needed summer into winter in arendelle anna feels its her responsibility to make amends with elsa and convince her to life the supernatural winter frozen is a fun film with charming characters and an unexpected ending anna and elsa are both sympathetic characters who feel alienated and alone i just want to give elsa a great big hug she tries her best to contain her powers and her feelings sacrificing her close relationship with her sister in order to shield her from harm she is forced to hide a fundamental part of herself in order to appear normal and utterly fails causing harm to her entire community i m glad she wasnt a real villain as in the original story which is very weird and religious but a person trying her best and making mistakes anna is funny quirky and definitely not the poised and graceful disney princess one might expect shes very clumsy and embarrassingly blurts out her feelings to random people she just wants a real relationship with her sister to be able to make friends and to have people around instead of cutting themselves off my favorite character is olaf the living snowman who loves warm hugs he provides perfect comic relief and hes just adorable disney films are rather guilty of having two people fall in love rather quickly based on next to nothing and then living happily ever after it seems as if this film goes in that direction when anna falls for prince hans of the southern isles and accepts a proposal within an evening of meeting when anna is once again injured by elsas magic her condition is said to be cured by an act of true love suggesting hans should save the day the ending switches things around and anna is cured because she threw herself in front of elsa as hans tried to kill her the true love in this instance wasnt romantic love but sisterly love i really enjoyed this subverting of typical disney tropes and the story is the best disney has produced in a while the music of the film is delightful and another reason for the films success the filmmakers opted to hire broadway composers to create these fun songs of varied styles do you want to build a snowman is a cute but sad song that encompasses anna and elsas relationship after the accident and each of their loneliness and frustration for the first time in forever is a cute song that shows anna silly and quirky nature and her excitement for human contact and a dash of elsas mantra to control her powers love is an open door is an adorable instalove song between anna and hans with more of a rock feel and fun harmonies in summer is olafs hilarious song about his obsession with summer but he has no idea what snow does in heat the song has a nice old hollywood musical flair and some unexpected lyrics the best song of the film is let it go elsas song of empowerment where she accepts herself despite what others think of her idina menzel belts out the song and gives it the power it needs the visuals are also amazing as elsa effortlessly builds an ice castle around herself the only part of the film i didnt really like was the trolls they were cute and provided some comedy but didnt really add much to the story they could have easily been cut out without anything essential being removed other than that frozen has my vote for best animated film of 
an amazing disney movie a lot of fun more grounded an dsensible than previous disney movies excluding tangled also good an enjoyable movie for all ages and both genders 
my year old insisted that i watch frozen with her it was her fourth time to see it i would have enjoyed it without her however watching it with her was like watching two movies at once 
i saw this movie for the first time at home on bluray loved it what a refreshing disney tale really everything is unique about this movie the setting norway snow the main characters sisters snowman and an ice seller the helpers reindeer trolls that masquerade as rocks its great to not be able to tell whats going to happen next how often does that happen in a disney movie soundtrack is awesome which is not surprising but some of the songs just wont let you go tee hee kids and adults will love this 
this is a heartfelt movie about the love and friendship between two sisters despite the obstacle that separated them it gave the lesson to young girls of being too trusting to a guy on the first impression basis the biggest plus about this movie is that the real meaning of true love is where you least expected it two thumbs up
a phenomenal movie with tremendous creativity and emotion my kids love the movie and music so much we bought the soundtrack and they are singing them all the time very life enriching we will watch this repeatedly for years to come 
shipping reviewarrived within hrs so that was great package was undamaged and in near perfect condition definitely recommend this sellers shipping product reviewlets face it frozen has taken over as the it movie of and aside from some rushed scenes and random characters the movie is really good im not a fan of idina menzels singing in let it go but its passable in terms of plot its really interesting how it goes against the traditional disney meet and marry theme by saying you cant marry someone you just met focusing on love as the bond between anna and elsa the movie is refreshing in style and breaks stereotypes overall its a great movie 
took my year old daughter to see frozen last night we were both very excited to see the movie based on the previews we had seen our love for animated movies this movie will not disappoint you it was an absolute gem of a movie although we saw it in d it was visually stimulating with stunning effects action sequences characters all the characters scenery and animation were simply amazing not too mention the voices of all the characters were a perfect fit each voice over was clear and accurately defined now for the story it was a well written story with built in humor loyalty friendship and love a story that kids of all ages adults could follow believe in there is something in this movie for everyone that watches it if you have children take them to see this movie asap it is the perfect time of year and will add to the holiday spirit if your child ask your parent or parents to take you to this movie if your an adult go see this movie it will most likely bring back fond memories and you will leave the theater fulfilled i give this movie an a thanks for reading my review and if you like it please comment 
i liked the movie because the story was awesome and really fun the snowman olaf is really cute and adorable and was a great add to the story what i thought was messed up is when olaf sing the song in summer saying that he want to be summer time since it always winter during the film i think they added some disney hummer to the movie 
very cute with a nice twist at the end ive heard complaints about the one character being too sexy but hello did you lot see happy feet nicole kidman penguin slithering all over pimp penguin hooker penguins yeah not a kids movie in this she just sways her hips when she walks give me a break cute story nice link to other stories as usual i could do w o the dorky stuff like the trolls but overall i enjoyed this 
since john carpenters darkstar or lost in space i did not have as much fun as with this movie sandra bullock and george clooney are amazing the images and framing is excellent and if you get the chance to see this masterpiece in d do it it is well worth it alfonso and jon aacute s cuar oacute n wrote a suspenseful story you will be holding your breath almost most of the time of this film the score fits perfectly and makes this awesome ride even more enjoyable i wonder if the director shot the movie in sequence since sandra bullocks acting is so believable especially towards the end if you decide you rather stay on earth check out this little film about dating in new york the manhattan dating project 
gravity can be summed in just one sentence it is one of the best films i have seen this year or in many years but there is so much to write about it that i cannot stop at one line houston i have a bad feeling about this mission says astronaut matt kowalski george clooney as he continues to joke around cruising around in jetpacks miles above earth the first scenes are incredible as the planet earth lies beneath the space shuttle while three engineers dr ryan stone sandra bullock are tethered to it while doing patch up work on the hubble telescope while talking to mission control played by ed harris the sound effects on the dialogues are incredible planet earth never looked so beautiful and so is the long shot of the space shuttle slowly edging on to view and in d one can feel the isolation stillness and the soundlessness of space i have yet to see the making of the movie and i will but i think it would be a lot of people spending countless hours on special effects gravity is a science fiction film with many scientific inaccuracies for example although russians and chinese have their space missions in roughly the same locality as the us missions it is not easy to get to their missions in space with jetpacks as shown in the film there are other doubtable scenes but most people would hardly care for these inaccuracies as the magic is in the presentation about space and also about human loss and pain isolation the futility of life and in the perseverance to fight for its last breath i was surprised to find myself reacting so strongly at many moments in the film even though the movie is only minutes long it keeps you in its grip for the entire duration suspended in gravity and riveted by the disaster that unfolds before your eyes the happenings strike you again and again and stay with you as debris from a russian space explosion hurls towards them they are asked by mission control to abort their task and get back into the shuttle as disaster strikes leaving people dead and leaving stone and kowalski stranded in space the special effects are just amazing here i am not going to tell you what happens from this point but will point out that amidst the background of the cgi effects is the most moving human performance by sandra bullock just watch her in the communication with a greenlandic fisherman named on earths surface using a ham radio and feel tears coming out of your eyes or in the final scenes a performance of a lifetime i think the cinematography by emmanuel lubezki and sandra bullock are the stars of the film do yourself a favor and watch it on the biggest imax screen that you can see it on you wont be disappointed five stars 
this was a great film the d format was utterily spectacular george clooney and sandra bullock were perfect this film making their debut d movie appeareance on the front cover of the upcoming disc special edition d v d release it has sandra bullock appearing as a adult fetus floating in her mothers womb nice i will pre order this great film this film just won academy awards but did not win best actress sandra bullock or best picture years a slave took best picture but gravity took the entire night by winning the most awards 
sometimes it is hard to separate your true feelings for a film and the bountiful opinions of other more vocal critics walking into gravity i was nearly set up for sheer disappointment the buzz surrounding the film and the near unanimous raves for it made it appear to be one of those overhyped gargantuan films that leave the viewer with nowhere to go but down that was my biggest fear tonight that i was going to wind up feeling betrayed by the early ink and ultimately have my theater experience dampened gravity does not disappoint i don t really know where to start or even how to construct this review at all there is hardly anyway to spoil the film for someone who hasn t seen it the only real question that one will have walking in is whether or not sandra bullock s character dies and i m not about to reveal that answer but outside of that there isn t anything i can say that will lessen the impact of the film itself the fact remains that this film is a thrill ride from start to finish and that it uses the most of every single frame in play milking each scene for optimum effect the plot is simple debris from an accidental missile attack sends waves of danger to a group of astronauts and essentially causes a lot of issues for the initial impacts sole survivor doctor ryan stone this initial wave of debris hits about ten minutes into the movie and from that point forward the impact is felt it ripples from frame to frame scene to scene like the monstrous approach of a tsunami my hand hurts because my wife was squeezing it for the entire ninety minutes heaps of praise have been shovels upon the film s director alfonso cuaron and the star sandra bullock and that praise is deserved one hundred fold cuaron is a visionary director one that understands the fabric of film and how to present it in a way that transports you i saw this in children of men and he does it again here to possibly even greater effect every aspect of this movie is presented in a way that entices the senses from the remarkable imagery the way that empty space is captured here is breathtaking to the effective use of sound and lack thereof gravity completely takes over your body it lives in you in all honesty i left the theater feeling like my senses had been heightened sound was much crisper and the air around me was much clearer it affected me physically which is something i never expected my hat truly goes off to sandra bullock though without her dedicated performance this film would have failed miserably as much as this is about the technical aspect of things and as much as this is cuaron s movie bullock had a lot on her shoulders and she makes this movie so incredibly human and intimate despite the grandeur of it all from an outside perspective it may appear that she has nothing to do but panic and she does a lot of that but she slowly yet surely develops a beautifully fleshed out character who embodies the core themes of this film namely the very will to survive her solemn confession about her daughter paints a dark picture almost upfront but she chips away at that density the reveal a woman renewed by her bleak circumstances to find the will to live again the film uses her and she in turn uses to film to completely flip the direness of it all on its head to unveil an uplifted spirit and delivers to the audience one of the most engrossing tales of internal and external survival i ve ever seen put to film many critics have already heralded this as a masterpiece this year is so rich already and i ve only seen a handful of films but i won t hesitate to thrust that label on this film it truly is a marvelous piece of art and it is easily the best film i ve seen so far this year the great thing about gravity is that it isn t just a masterpiece in a singular aspect but from every angle this film is nearly perfect 
extremely great from story to sandra bullock as a strong female lead totally believable i had read through other reviews and almost passed this prerelease by so glad i went with my gut to watch it effects awesome loved the story the acting nothing bad to say about it just the right amount of time kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time murphys law in space dont pass this one up keep these prerelease movies coming amazon 
this is a must see in d i rarely go to the theatre content to watch dvds at home but i made a special effort despite the cost i do not regret it and i recommend you spend the money for an experience that is absolutely amazing i consider this to be the most powerful experience watching a film of my life it is as close as one can get to actually being in outer space there are some heavy duty spiritual overtones much food for thought my conclusion after viewing this brilliant beautiful and engrossing film theres no place like home theres no place like home 
gravity is a tense spare visual masterpiece which depicts space as both beautiful and terrifying sandra bullocks heartfelt performance was oscar worthy and george clooney was also excellent what i particularly liked about the film was the economy with which the story was told there were no wasted scenes or lines in that way it reminded me of another science fiction masterpiece the original alien i read that some idiot studio executive had pressured alfonso cuaron to add flashbacks a love interest for sandra bullock and an action packed helicopter rescue at the end i am happy cuaron resisted and stuck to his own creative vision 
i didnt think i would like this movie i havent liked most non sci fi movies about space boring i only went because it was the only movie available at the time i had available i was shocked to find this movie to be amazing on many levels good plot truly scary and tense and im pretty jaded very good acting incredible visuals and very thought provoking but you must see this in imax d the d is essential to give you the feeling of weightlessness in space a crucial part of the movies experience and the imax to give an appreciation of the magnitude of it all incredible panoramas of earth or depicting the enormous emptiness of space sprinkled with stars as a backdrop to the astronauts it makes you feel very small trust me you gotta see this no matter your taste its sure to punch your gut and tantalize your brain 
gravity is without a doubt one of the single most impressive space films ever made alfonso cuar oacute ns skills as a writer and director are used to their fullest not since the likes of a space odyssey or apollo has any film taken us into the cold quiet reaches of space quite like this and stranded us there with such insurmountable odds of survival 
gravity is one of my favorite films of im very happy to see that alfonso won best director at the golden globes i became a fan of alfonso cuaron after the prisoner of azkaban his directing style is always present and very effective gravity is a powerful film about life in space ive seen many films in but this really stood out to me the acting from sandra bullock and george clooney is excellent the sound design is amazing the sound effects and vfx really immerses you into the film i highly recommend gravity 
already nominated for four golden globes this year i was really excited to finally get to see gravity its been called the best film of the year and i can definitely see why sandra bullock stars as ryan stone a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission with veteran astronaut matt kowalsky george clooney during a routine space walk disaster strikes and their shuttle is destroyed their left completely alone drifting into blackness as their oxygen levels decrease rapidly fighting to survive their story will leave you on the edge of your seat youve never seen space as vivid and beautiful with stunning visual effects that will blow you away sandra bullock delivers a stellar performance and deserves a best actress nod george clooney is able to bring new life into his acting and immerses himself into the role with oscarseason just around the corner this is a must see for all ages rated pg for intense sequences and language gravity was a visual feast that i couldnt get enough of 
absolutely no spoilers in this reviewjust moments after this movie ended my daughter leaned over to me and declared this is the most perfect film i have ever seen in just about every way i had to agree gravity gives you everything thrilling action awesome visuals incomparable cinematic spectacle a terrifying scenario an exciting adventure and a masterpiece of minimalist characterization they all combine in one pedal to the metal slam bam technically perfect movie that gives you equal shots of hope and hopelessness from the first frame to the very last it is as electrifying a film as i have ever seen with scarcely a down moment in it hardly a misused frame i wont spend time telling you anything about the plot if the trailers havent told you enough about why this film is a must see then i can give you two words that should do it sandra bullock she is not only in practically every frame of the movie but she exposes herself emotionally here in more ways than i could count she is equal parts victim and heroine emotional and calculating frightened and bold wounded and powerful she is a tortured soul who reveals herself in dribs and drabs revealing her emotional torment when it will have the most effect the movie is as much about what has happened to her as what is happening to her she is able to make herself as interesting and captivating as the events that occur during the film and this is important rather than simply being a movie about a series of cascading terrors it is equally about the human spirit the stuff that lies inside us that drives us to go on when going on seems impossible gravity is amazing see it in imax d if you can it is worth the money the technology depicted in the movie is stunning but i imagine i will be as amazed when i finally get the dvd and find out how these truly amazing scenes were shot alfonso cuaron does remarkable job as director co writer and co editor of this absolutely wonderful accomplishment his technically perfect movie never loses track of the actor within it i wont be surprised if this achieves best picture best directing and best acting nominations this year notwithstanding a half dozen other technically related ones there have been some critics who have found fault with the movies accuracy when it comes to the positioning of the space stations the likelihood of a debris field causing a kesslar syndrome this devastating and some other technical flaws but i will leave these people to their respective perturbations to me it doesnt matter if gravity is science fiction or simply fiction about science what it definitely is is a tour de force balls to the wall spectacle that will leave you gasping dont miss it 
i saw it yesterday in d and cant stop thinking about it came to amazon to be notified when the dvd is available to purchase absolutely one wild ride that keep me at the edge of my seat sandra bullock deserves an oscar or at least a nomination for her character portrayal and of course george c was awesome as the mission commander providing incite and his brand of humor i will see this again x highly recommend it 
one of the most talked about trailers of the year has been the two minute trailer for gravity that features sandra bullock and george clooney floating in space in the two minutes we see a brief intense and desperate moment in the span of a long movie where bullocks character ryan stone tries to grab hold of anything and everything as her situation spins out of control many thought is that it is that what the movies about or two people in space that movie looks silly well gravity is far from silly on the other hand what you see in that trailer is exactly what you will have in store when you sit down to watch it it is exactly what the movie is about and there are only two people in the entire movie you will also see an amazingly well crafted intelligent exquisite and visceral space journey that possibly puts all other movies of the same vain to shame regardless of what you think of the trailer you couldnt take your eyes off of it for two minutes and that is exactly the way the full minute movie is gravity takes you into space and treats you as if you were a tag along for ryan stones journey the direction of alfonso cuaron is spot on if not for a few minor moments of over dramatization cuaron may be most well known for his direction of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban but he also directed children of men and one of my personal favorites a little princess this is a phenomenal achievement for cuaron and for the history and future of film making if youve ever desired to go to space this may be as close as you will ever get gravity rings authentic and it is exactly what movies are all about taking you the viewer along for a journey that you cant get in your ordinary life 
the best use of minutes in film ive ever seen the best kind of s f you cant tell if its fiction this film is so astonishing in scope and clarity that it will leave viewers stunned for minutes curiously i have no desire to see it a second time superb acting clooney never better heart stopping suspense the dream sequence is chilling up there with the shining quality of chills 
this is simply the most amazing film ive seen in a long time between the acting and the visuals it really feels like youre right there alongside the characters experiencing this i admit this movie is better in d hopefully you have a surround system and a large screen d capable tv to watch it on disc visuals i couldnt imagine how they made it look so real so i read up on it after i saw it the space scenes were a cleverly done combination of cgi and properly lit faces they had to come up with a whole new lighting system to sync them up the indoor zero g scenes required actor supporting automotive robots plus perfectly choreography and acting to work totally amazing and believable bullock works long hours and showed expert acting skills to pull this off reality it turns out only a few details were not true to life the initial disaster is something thats never yet happened in space but could the kessler effect dont look it up before seeing the film by eschewing the typical movie explosions they made the movie both factual and more believable the trailers for the movie did feature sounds they needed them to sell but once youre in the theater the actors rely on expressions voice movement and breathing rates to indicate emotion the music is not intrusive and was a big contributing factor to atmosphere its impossible to describe the sense of terror and panic these things convey items outside the shuttle and space stations break up silently but no less frighteningly one article on line really summed this up for me it said that most space films give a romantic view of space this move imparts the actuality of the awesome and terrifying nature of it instead acting as i said above superb sandra bullock spent hour days alone inside a cramped set to clomplete the film she could only communicate by headset her dedication shows george clooney is also at his very best his easy manner even in an emergency a true portrayal of a long time professional trained to keep his head in any situation bullocks character had only trained months for her first space expedition sound stunning subtle composer steven price manages to make a perfect score that enhanses the emotion and action without being obtrusive thats a hard feat to pull off in space where nothing ahs sound portions were done to match the tempo of an actors heartbeat no percussion is used theres an ominous lonely feel soundtrack shows no scenes gives nothing away google gravity official soundtrack composer steven price p buy it i plan to youll love it 
i cant say enough good things about gravity it is a cinematic accomplishment of the likes that we havent seen since before avatar ive seen it times in the theater alone sandra bullocks performance is the best of her career the soundtrack is celestial the cinematography is breathtaking and technically proficient on a level that no other film has been in the last years i found the themes and symbolism to be emotionally and spiritually gratifying 
from the moment the action starts the movie is suspense adding to that suspense is the reality of cold unforgiving space both actors did well but saundra bullock pulled off a command performance making you believe she was in peril the whole time for a sci fi action movie this is one that can happen tonight in reality if the right set of circumstances were to happen it brings to light that space travel is anything but routine and that any moment even the best of our astronauts and mission specialist can die to events beyond their control if you want to see what our explorers of the future are in store for this is the movie to give you a hint at what the human race will face going out into the void watch this and realize what we are getting ourselves into i am sure there are many of us here on planet earth that would be still more than willing to go 
im using samsung equipment and the active glasses take some getting used to as the instructions are limited and somewhat confusing in order to activate the glasses one must bring the glasses less than two feet from the screen and hold the button until a message pops up on screen telling me the glasses are connected that said the glasses work well its not like imax or anything like the big screen but the d effect is excellent the movie is a metaphor about isolation death and rebirth some of it subtle and some obvious such as the moment when stone is floating in the womb of an airlock with a floating cord positioned like an umbilical cord the dramatic conflict of man out of his element and struggling to survive is in a great many scenes those who found this boring are a mystery to me and those who quibble with the physics forget that this isnt a documentary but a work of fiction they apparently have no difficulty with a movie where a tornado picks up a house and puts it in the land of oz but here they are disturbed by momentum and inertia not being properly portrayed its movie and it tells a good story with a sound structure and beautiful images and an underlying life affirming theme the several hours of extras will be fascinating to effects buffs as they show how the movie was shot and the many innovations in filming that made the long takes and convincing weightlessness possible for those with d equipment this is a must have movie 
when the movie was finished and i walked out of the theater i was still holding my breath it took me some time to begin breathing normally and for the next several hours i reflected on this incredible thrill ride the effects are staggering the views are mesmerizing the soundtrack is grand but ms bullocks acting is what really makes this film the ride of the century sandra bullocks emotions come through in a way that brings me close to her i feel her fear her anguish her hopelessness its her acting talent that brings me into the story and gives me a part in the film yes the special effects tell a compelling story as does the soundtrack but ms bullocks acting puts this film over the top it is clearly the best movie this year and for this genre its certainly the best ever screenplay cinematography acting and soundtrack are all absolutely first rate i watched it in d for most films i think d detracts and distracts from the story but this film is better for being in d i also think that the experience in the theater is well worth it see it and for once i say see it in d 
the pre release buzz on this film was approaching hyperbole people were comparing it to a space odyssey and avatar calling it a masterpiece and a game changer i was like wow this is the hollywood hype machine going into full throttle hey i like hype as much as the next guy i love it when people get excited about going to the movies because some cultural phenomenon is tearing it up at the box office ultimately i didnt buy into any of the hype i just wanted to see the film first of all this was one of the best d experiences ive ever had ive had quite a few the finest of the lot would be avatar and the hobbit hfr d i know a lot of people hate that high frame rate frames per second process that the hobbit utilized but it made the d and c g i remarkable i would place gravity in a close rd place behind those two and in front of the great d in the life of pi and hugo the sense of depth in gravity was amazing the sense of weightless floating was palpable just as a space simulator this film is a remarkable achievement of the first rank this will win the academy award for best cinematography some people cant grasp how difficult some of the work was to do this film should be recognized for the breathtaking visual feast thats on display here the sound design was also extraordinary and deserves the highest praise now we get to the narrative the story the plot well now some astronauts are working in the earths orbit and then something goes wrong thats it thats the whole plot i doubt thats a spoiler of any kind it might have been interesting if nothing went wrong i dont know that would be an avant garde space film but everyone knows something has to go wrong in order for the drama to commence and something goes wrong again and again every minutes to keep the drama moving along this is a very straight up bare bones thriller structure which is perfectly legitimate perhaps even showcasing bravery from the creative team to just write a simple space thriller and then focus on the technical details the simulation experience not on the narrative maybe thats why i deeply admire the film on a technical level but i dont love it to add layers to the simple story the film dives head first into a lot of symbolism spoilers ahead the endless umbilical cord imagery in the film when the astronauts are constantly entangled in one thing after another sandra bullock floating like a fetus the earth itself as the mother of humanity and the force of gravity that draws its wayward astronaut children back to the planet how about sandra bullock emerging from the ocean at the end like the first human or the first creature to crawl walk on land all the evolution imagery life began as stardust that floated to the earth was born in the oceans then crawled onto land hey maybe this film is deep or maybe not the biggest problem is that gravity relies too much on contrived plot points to further the tension and drama a fire breaks out here a spacesuit rips a space station explodes more than once oxygen is constantly running out yeah its really hard to survive in space life in space is impossible as the movie states but why all this artificial drama one problem after another it felt like the story was stuck on wheels that couldnt naturally build momentum the writers director just pushed it every so often then theyd push it again and again it was forced and contrived not natural storytelling eventually it started to get so ridiculous that when bullocks space capsule crashed into the ocean and she escapes into the water i thought for sure a shark would swim by and sandra would have to punch it in the eye and fight it off director alfonso cuaron who co wrote gravity with his son should be commended for not succumbing to hollywood studio pressure to force gravity to be more than what it is the studio gave such helpful suggestions like cut to houston and show nasa scrambling to save the astronauts cut to flashbacks of sandra bullocks life on earth with her daughter develop a love story between the george clooney and sandra bullock characters all genius suggestions not thankfully cuaron was able to stick to his guns he could have padded the running time of the film with extraneous material but he was wise not to go that route at the same time it felt like a missed opportunity because cuaron could have gone in the opposite direction and made an avant garde cinematic experience like or something down that road instead we get a conventionally structured thriller but one that takes place in space and uses the most incredible special effects and d still i would be a grouchy individual indeed if i didnt give this film stars just as a cinematic tour de force definitely a must see regardless of any griping about what could have been a special and unique achievement 
the irony of the films title is that there isnt any gravity that is but thats not to say it lacks gravitas it does in ways both unexpected and transcendent its been seven long years since alfonso cuar oacute ns last film s emotionally propulsive thriller children of men which was a masterful work of suspense in the midst of one seriously dystopian vision of the apocalypse somehow the less than prolific filmmaker manages to surpass that impressive work with this terrifying yet genuinely profound science fiction thriller that buzzes by in a fleet minutes although ang lee effectively used d cgi effects to enhance the magical realism oflife of pi i have never seen a film use them as purposefully and powerfully as cuar oacute n does here within the dramatic structure of the story co written with his son jon aacute s the screenplay by contrast is life size in its intimacy and even with all the technical jargon at times poetic this combination gives the film an almost mythic reach and at the same time brings insight into the way the human spirit works against the overwhelming emptiness of space the story takes place about miles above earth and the alternately ethereal and scarifying setting is captured in brilliant detail by ace cinematographer emmanuel lubezki and special effects master tim webber pay particularly close attention to the uninterrupted seventeen minute sequence that opens the film its a bravura piece of cinema by anyones standards in brief bio medical engineer dr ryan stone is on her first space mission studiously installing a device to fix the hubble space telescope on the u s space shuttle explorer mission commander matt kowalski is a veteran astronaut who devilishly spacewalks around her in a jet pack mission control reports that the russians have blown up one of their own satellites which transforms into a massive attack of hurling debris that arrives in a matter of seconds and will continue to make an orbital return causing massive destruction every ninety minutes there is no time for the crew to return to the shuttle much less earth and the damage to the craft and nearby international space station is extensive its enough to say that stone sets off on a journey not only of physical survival but spiritual awakening as her character has been in a listless state since a senseless personal tragedy occurred back home if you dont count the voiceovers at the beginning there are only two actors who make up the entire cast and they are grade a stars who bring their personal charisma to the fore george clooney has the smaller of the two roles as kowalski and he uses his natural insouciance to great effect as his wisecracking gives way to a character who provides the knowledgably becalming tone that stone needs at the storys most critical points he makes one particularly risky scene work by the sheer magnitude of his characters life affirming bravado he also impressively wrote the scene even so this is sandra bullocks film from start to finish and it amazes me how she wasnt even among the top casting choices for the role angelina jolie turned it down twice although stone may come across as emotionally stunted bullock offers her natural likeability as a necessary counterbalance however that observation short changes her stellar work here especially the pure physicality of her performance intriguingly her character is not that far removed from the one she played nearly twenty years earlier inwhile you were sleepingin that both deal with personal losses with an emotional alertness that wins us over completely only this time she does it with a graceful maturity that deepens the catharsis of the incredible odyssey she experiences this in spite of a few overtly sentimental moments thrown in for good measure regardless this is cuar oacute ns towering cinematic achievement and the movie truly stands on its own 
inevitably there will be those how nit pick this or that aspect of this very realistic minimalist film i on the other hand found it surprisingly good why reviewers have made mention that sandra was not the first or allegedly even the fifth actress offered this part is entirely beyond me of the names mentioned that were offered the part before her i believe going in she would have done a better job than any of them as it turns out she did an excellent completely credible job an attractive years of age she is credible in the role in ways that the younger actresses simply would not have been if youve seen the film can you imagine scarlet johansen doing as good a job in this role also i think it was a particularly gutsy move to kill off the male lead and the minimalism of both the plot and the number of actors in this film attests to how strong it had to be artistically in order to pull off its high entertainment value for me this film is strong and would pair particularly well as a double feature with the abyss after the film i was moved to reflect that space may be a necessary playground for scientists but it will remain far too technical and dangerous much less expensive to think that even semi ordinary people will end up there on holiday anytime in the foreseeable future finally i particularly appreciate a science fiction movie with such a strong human element the movie is a human drama set in near earth orbit instead of the typical scifi where machines unbelievable action stunts and spectacular visuals must carry the audience thanks to george clooneys journeyman performance and sandra bullocks dogged determination to keep it real this film earns a place in my scifi library when many other alleged block busters have and will not see the film on its own terms and look past the surface panoramas the last scene when sandra digs her fingers into the wet sand of terra firma again for the first time says it all 
its been an awfully long time since an honest to goodness science fiction film one that doesnt involve robot monsters aliens comic book heroes or the like has been made in hollywood but it seems like we have one in the form of mexican born director alfonso cuarons hour and a half opus gravity probably about as original and realistic a film as one could be that is set in the vastness of space even if it is just above the earths atmosphere that hollywood has made after films like a space odyssey marooned and apollo films that it resembles quite strikingly at times gravity stars sandra bullock and george clooney as astronauts doing a routine repair job on the hubble space telescope who find themselves in the middle of a crisis when a huge debris field created by the accidental missile hit on a russian satellite destroys both the space shuttle and the telescope itself and the remaining shuttle crew the horrifying incident leaves the two of them stranded some miles above the earths surface with only their spacesuits for protection against the airless and soundless vacuum of the void their only hope for survival is to reach the international space station the trouble is however that the debris field caused by the satellite explosion has created a chain effect of other satellites and space platforms being destroyed in orbit creating a massive swath of debris that keeps hurtling at them at thousands of miles per hour and some of that debris has indeed destroyed the i s s and killed most of the crew clooney sacrifices himself in order to get bullock into the remaining soyuz escape pod still attached to the i s s but again complications arise only after a hair raising eye popping dilemma does bullock get into the pod and head for the nearby chinese space station which itself has suffered tremendous damage bullock understandably in a huge panic has only a limited amount of time before she gets into the chinese escape pod and survives the intense heat of re entry not to mention another debris field created by the chinese space station as it re enters the atmosphere whether seen in the regular wide screen format in d or in the specialized imax d where it would share a further comparison with the imax documentary about the space shuttle program the dream is alive gravity succeeds as great science fiction and while it is at times overwhelmed with the d process and the avalanche of special cgi effects though the budget stayed at under million the effects dont overshadow the storyline or the characters which is a marked and refreshing contrast from most hollywood big budget spectacles of the st century cuaron co wrote the screenplay with his son jonas and although some of the situations dont conform so much to the reality of space as they do to a slightly clich eacute d hollywood version of it something that stanley kubrick avoided extremely successfully in overall the end result is a film that has a lot of the grace of the extreme tension of marooned and the high stakes terror of apollo films that it can stand up to comparison quite well clooney and bullock the latter especially so since she must carry most of the movie on her own in a way shes not had to do since probably speed in give very solid performances here and perhaps as a nod to apollo cuaron cast ed harris who portrayed nasa flight director gene kranz in that movie as the off screen voice of mission control here the final result in gravity is one of the best science fiction movies of recent years and clearly a film to be relished as one of the best for 
its the way this story is told through visual effects and great acting sandra bullock that puts the audience in place of the character terrified in the cold darkness of space with the scintillating backdrop of earth its the ultimate contrast in art life below and utter nothingness above its like the movie has turned heaven and hell upside down the silent catastrophes with artificial objects shattering into smithereens except the human spirit 
clocking in only at about minutes this is a film about going home once the disaster hits and it is jolting about minutes in or so we go along with dr stone as she fights to stay alive it is a true odyssey it is masterful it is achingly beautiful at times with just the right touches of poignancy the music is just right and never overpowers the film the direction is amazing there are three films that have put me in space apollo and gravity clooney gives a wonderful performance as the mission commander kowalski that gets little attention as it is a supporting role but i cant think of an actor i would rather have sandra bullock gives her finest performance in gravity she is transcendent the last such powerful performance by a woman in a sf film was given by sigourney weaver in aliens i doubt she will win for best actress at the oscars she should but while this is the type of film that may occasionally get acting recognition it is always deemed enough simply to be nominated not enough to me bullock should win the same goes for the film and the director its odd to see so many people disliking this film i guess to many people a trip into space and fighting to survive is not enough to make up a film it needed more subplots a larger cast etc different strokes and all that i was worried that seeing this at home without d would diminish the effect i neednt have worried the impact of seeing this film was only minutely diminished to me this is the best film of and one of the best films of the past decade 
i was compelled to review this film after seeing the dismal list of bad reviews from individuals with some of the most irrelevant and trifling complaints ive ever read their lack of vision disturbs me actually those kind of reviews are inadvertently a positive broadcasting for how much depth there really is to this film yes this film is by far the best space film since kubricks yes i said it i would liken it to a religious experience i cried it was a spiritual wake up call to how precious life on this planet really is it changed my whole perspective the film is a real to life depiction of life and danger in space with our current real life level of technology its important to this keep in mind before viewing this is not a science fiction film at all it is so grounded in reality and current tech only the hypothetical possibility of the events and details of the story are a fiction so dont expect lasers and aliens and if your looking for something to shut up your brats while they scarf down some fries you might want to rent a cartoon about wise cracking inanimate objects instead so ignore the bad reviews from the bungled and the botched and prepare to have your vision of reality adjusted by gravity
we are in front of an original artistc proposal cuaron has made a film about the outer space without aliens of creatures from other galaxies its a very short tale about a terrible accident when the things come out of control and the only possibility for surviving overcomes by far the theory from the books bullock and clooney alone in atmosphere zero communications breakdown and all this mess you count with your knowledge and your surviving instinct the film is far from falling into evocations or cynical comments houston we are blind is all what youll hear like a leit motive sandra bullock i knew about her for the first time as lenina huxley in demolition man another science fiction film has made at least to my mind her best performance of her succesful artistic career she shows us her weakness despair anguish demons and limitations and never plays the role of a superwoman dislike the charismatic rippley s weaver in aliens saga for instance against all the odds kudos for this singular script for the overwhelming artistic direction for the edition for the brilliant special effects this picture should win hands down against the rest of the other nominated films 
i was certain this movie was going to suck i saw the trailer and swore that it was another roland emerich schlockfest disaster movie but i was dead wrong i dont even think i can correctly describe this film in words its almost impossible its tough its real no not realistic i said real and it just succeeds on every level it reminds me in some ways of cuarons earlier film children of men that review is coming soon it had a message but that message couldnt be correctly conveyed without the film itself for the bottom line ive gotta call this movie for what it is and that simply is perfect easily a heartfelt focused and masterfully shrouded in sheer anxiety gravity redefinesfilm making on the every level as a whole it is a true masterpiece 
great action you can put yourself in her shoes not a story but an event i think that is where it falls short i found it strange when she said she hated space why would you send someone who felt that way 
saw this in the theater and could not wait to buy it def a great movie to watch again and again
i finally got to see the movie and i thought it was amazing for those people who want to shoot holes in it because the characters hair did not float as it would in space give me a break they cant film in space are you daft yes you have to suspend some things you know to be true its called entertainment seriously if you are that picky dont go to the movies you will find fault in most of them for the rest of us who are able to enjoy a good movie i have to say this one was stunning if you do see it i would highly suggest you see it in d the shots are stunning and the film had me so involved i was trying to help the character i want this movie in my library and as soon as it is available i want to see this again though sadly i will have watch in d i dont have that nice of a tv 
as i write this my head is still whirling from this movie this has to be the best movie i have seen in more than years perhaps longer to attempt to summarize this movie is just not possible for me all i can say is wow 
this is a fascinating movie combining superb special effects fine acting and an inspirational storyline the story is one of humans struggling against adversity rather than being a space or science fiction story as such it has broader audience appeal its a well crafted movie with excellent performances from the small cast in particular sandra bullock gives a fine performance in a highly complex and demanding role the special effects are not obtrusive and the d effect is worthwhile i recommend this movie as an inspirational experience 
this is a great performance by sandra watching in d really helps you pretend you are also in space thanks to who ever had the foresight to produce this in d 
my mom and i went to see this today i actually had no clue what it was about i have heard it was good before the review a few things if you are one who has motion sickness i would not see this movie i never get bothered by stuff moving around a lot but many times while watching this movie i started breathing really fast and my heart started beating faster it gets intense if you are one who needs a lot of stuff happening this may not be for you do not get me wrong there are things happening but it is all set within a single area the camera never gets to far from the characters it does when they are in space but when they are in the ship it is very close to them there are movies in which a killer is in the woods and you must escape through all the hazards in order to find safety there are movies in which you are in a ship and must find land before massive storms destroy you there are movies in which one is abused and must find the courage within themselves to find safety all of those situations are dangerous and if you do not give your all you will not survive now if you will imagine you are in a place in which there is no air no land no possible way to survive unless everything works to the exact degree that it was intended welcome to gravity this is really a psychological movie it is about a person or people who with no contact hardly any movement and all the odds against them having to find a way to live sometimes they will realize that they have to do things differently in order to live they may give up only to have something happen that makes them realize they should and can survive by using that which they have learned there are times in the movie in which the people will be outside the shuttle due to something happening debris is coming towards the ship when you see it you will get very tense then they are climbing on the stuff trying to get to a location you will feel tense it is very nerve racking there are no more than four people in this movie i do not want to give anything away but i just wanted to let people know that this is not a movie with a lot of back and forth it is almost like i am legend there are things that bothered me in this movie things that happened that really did not make much sense the very end is a bit odd as well after everything that happened it just did not seem like a big enough ending but i will buy this movie i can only imagine how intense this will be if i watch it at home it was an interesting movie that i am happy to have seen 
gravity is an unparalleled d experience on a high quality home theater on my very large samsung d monitor gravity is the best d experience thus far produced it is not only better on my cmr clear motion rate system than in the latest greatest imax d theater it is much better the plot actors script scientific accuracy pacing and just about everything else is subpar i have never felt that high quality special effects make a lousy movie worth watching and i still don t but like the first star wars in gravity is a breakthrough technology experience and like star wars d gravity in the home theater will continue to be enjoyable to watch you couldn t pay me to watch gravity in d standard definition or watch star wars as a play gravity s theater versions d blu ray dvd streaming versions are so different that they should be treated as distinct and separate products mixing all reviews of all versions into one big pot has made the reviews soup tasteless and unappealing thankfully some content providers are providing filtering of reviews by version packaging vendor performance etc on a related matter gravity has put a final nail in the coffin of amazon s arrogance in refusing to filter reviews by version and issue shipping packaging price etc i am so sick and tired of having to wade through irrelevant reviews that i no longer see amazon as the best source of acquiring movies and tv shows i have begun purchasing from a competitor that i was led to after i was fed up with not easily finding relevant reviews of d gravity thank goodness there is still some competition in amazon s markets 
beautifully shot acted scored and executed im not a huge fan of space survival type movies but this one hits all the right notes including a reasonable run time theres really only one small section where i felt like okay get on with the plot already this is the type of movie that i feel benefits from the grander scope offered by a movie theater viewing but id also be interested in getting a blu ray or dvd copy to see all the extras and behind the scenes stuff sandra bullocks picked some interesting roles of late but here she gets to prove she can really act because its really all about her character dr ryan stone digging deep to find the will to keep fighting against mounting despair and failing machinery a worthy addition to a movie collection 
although this movie is stunning in a visual way with great acting and thrilling action produced by intense situations i think only a few catch the real spiritual meaning behind it the movie consists of only two actors and set entirely in space this simplicity behind it helps intensify the spiritual emphasis by eliminating distractions usually found in most movies there are no meaningless gun fights perverse killings and aliens monsters set out to destroy the human race instead the setting consists of two astronauts floating in the calmness of space attempting to repair a satellite while a visually stunning large earth looms silently below the calmness violently comes to an end when an accident sends debris racing toward the astronauts and their space shuttle at over mile per hour i dont want to give too much away but the movie has one thrilling emotionally charged action scene after another the main underlying plot consists of one character ryan stone played by sandra bullock that goes through spiritual awakening through times of intense suffering and pain as the movie progresses you find out in small pieces that ryan is a emotionally tormented soul from her recent experiences on earth which could represent the human race in general the cold empty space the movie takes place in could also symbolize the emptiness that exists without the incredible creation of life we all take for granted at one point ryan decides to give up and peacefully accept her fate and eventual death something most of us have experienced at one time or another in our lives i personally found this scene to be intensely peaceful this scene expressed how life at times can be intense emotional or physical suffering and death as a peaceful end to it at the brink of death and desperation ryan has a vision or spiritual awakening also comparable to what natives experience while hallucinating on peyote and decides not to give up on life and make her way back to earth spoiler alert when ryan makes it back to earth her space pod crashes into the ocean she barely escapes to the surface after removing her heavy space suit and most of her clothing you could say this could represent baptism or washing away of her past and being reborn again she swims to the beach with a new intense gratitude for life this scene is very powerful and gives the audience a new appreciation for this incredible beautiful planet that gives us all the scared gift of life this movie is very powerful in a spiritual and inspirational way dont miss it 
 gravity is the sort of movie i would usually be railing about because of the over usage of computer generated special effects but gravity is the exception those special effects are there for one reason and one reason only to serve and highlight the acting i could give you a point by point synopsis of the film but that might make the movie seem pedestrian to someone who hasnt seen it so heres the general plot during a space walk on a shuttle three astronauts are working on fixing the hubble telescope when its reported a nearby satellite has exploded first reports indicate theres no danger but soon enough the shuttle and crew is being bombarded by exploding satellite parts at miles per hour only astronauts matt kowalski george clooney and ryan stone sandra bullock survive and theyre separated from the shuttle survival is the rest of the movie its bullocks film as she moves from a scared mission specialist to someone that runs the gamut of emotions as she struggles to survive in an environment not suited to survival director alfonso cuaron could have easily been overwhelmed by the computer generated effects or let them be the star while he does give you sweeping panoramic shots of the astronauts floating in space with the earth serenely revolving beneath them that is only to give the viewer a sense of what its like to be in space quick flashes of clooneys and bullocks characters show how quickly the peacefulness can be swept away by the realities of space a note while its true that in space no one can hear you scream it also seems true that if youre a woman in space under your suit you need to be in form fitting panties and a skimpy t shirt true for sigourney weaver in alien and true for bullock in gravity 
this is one of those rare movies like avatar which i strongly recommend being watched in d imax its worth the for the entertainment i have never seen the earth so huge the stars so vivid the floating astronaut and space shuttle so life like in this d imax experience 
this was a beautiful visual experience and a story to keep you on the edge of your seat to the very end george clooney and sandra bullock were brilliant i could watch this again and again 
i dont normally give stars because my two favorites the s version of the haunting and ridley scotts alien get gravity is right in there theres a moment in this movie that really p me off and it concerns george clooneys character people who have already seen the movie know what i mean by that normally when a horror movie does that and this is a horror movie i dont care what anyone says i dont want to watch the rest of it in the end i do feel that that element of the movie was necessary however and did enhance the plot of the movie i want to watch this movie over and over its a very scary movie 
excellent great movie in d imax because the movie is about the vastness lifelessness of space which of course makes one think on the universal theme of aloneness the script is superior the cinematography is perfect as are the effects that make us feel as if we are there with sandra bullock and george clooney both actors are at their best bullock has never had a better script to work with clooney is generous in his acting both are entirely believable in the roles they play the attention to detail in the movie is impressive the stars are aligned correctly and the minutia of space travel is getting thumbs up from space enthusiats 
director alfonso cuaron children of men harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban took and amazingly simple premise of a fictional sts space transport system mission using the now retired space shuttle fleet and bringing the reality of walking in space to complete and full visceral life on the big screen gravity is one of those films where youll leave the theatre feeling like you had just experienced an amazing adventure yourself written by cuaron and his son jonas cuaron year of the nail this is a fresh original story that will move you with every frame of film this is one of those rare films where the experience is only enhanced if you see it both in d and in imax it was a thrilling adventure it was breathtaking it was scary it was awe inspiring and it was a roller coaster of action and event after event sandra bullock the proposal the blind side plays mission specialist and medical engineer ryan stone who definitively gives an academy award deserving performance throughout this production she plays a nervous somewhat excited and an extremely professional scientist sent up in orbit to enhance the hubble telescope the mission commander matt kowalsky who is on his last mission before retiring to earth is wonderfully played by george clooney batman robin the descendants he is light hearted professional and focused but knows how to make his team feel good about their work and being in space things go terrible wrong as a russian anti satellite test goes wrong and they have to destroy it in space shooting and destroying it with missiles from earth the debris from the explosion which we never actually see the explosion is blasted into orbit traveling in thousands of pieces at the speed of a bullet which is approximately to over miles per hour at those speeds with no atmosphere no resistance and no sound within half a second they rip through the shuttle the probes the satellites are literally pelted to pieces and yes even some of the crew because this happens in space its clooneys character that figures out that they stay in orbit around earth at that speed and appear every minutes or so and again rip through anything in their path until their individual orbits decay the film is basically about survival in what is literally the loneliest place you could ever be space no sound the finale is amazing and the depths that bullocks character goes through and the performance she gives will leave you inspired with just the two of the most incredible actors hollywood has to offer bullock and clooney along with director cuaron they take you a thrilling and peaceful journey through space space stations and even satellites that orbit above us as you read this even now with beautiful cinematography by emmanuel lubezki children of men sleepy hollow and incredibly accurate production design by andy nicholson the mummy alice in wonderland gravity is a full blown real movie experience the panoramas of the earth and space are amazing the stars shimmering against earth are beautiful and quiet and incredibly detailed especially in the imax and d format the music by steven price the worlds end is just as inspiring as the images you see this is one of the best science fiction films ive seen in a long while and it feels so visceral and life like that you actually feel good leaving the theatre take the whole family to see this one gravity is aptly name once you see it youll know why 
this was a completely amazing movie from artistic film stand point alone it was spectacular movie making everything looks great the sense of vertigo for me was palpable and the acting was excellent the story is more than just a survival movie in space it is a meditation on the human condition the triumph of the human spirit and the stunning beauty of gods creation i love love love how at the very end the character sandra plays emerges form the water through the muck unable to walk at first and eventually standing upright and walking away after giving thanks symbolic in ways that brought me to tears there is more to the name gravity than its name makes you believe the same is true of movies like flight if you dont get it then i suggest you take some time to understand we are all at play in the fields of the lord gonna watch it again tonight standing ovation and stars 
great movie special effects are great and not a dull moment during the entire film love it great acting well worth buying 
at first you will think you know the ending of this movie from the very start youve seen the previews and yet i can tell you what you have seen is only a small part how can someone make a movie with such emotional courage spiritual inspiration and sheer determination out of what we have already seen but they do oh they do it was motivational for me what makes it so i suppose its the human side of us how we control or not control our anxiety to survive when is it time to give up and when it is not and while the special effects dont even seem like special effects they are more like pure photography so too are the sound effects because they dont seem like effects but the real thing they simply allow the movie to be real if youve ever wanted to go to space see this movie it gives you every angle every bit of technology and every fear coupled with the natural laws that matter must obey the only thing is being human is more than a natural order of things bad things do happen in space or right here on earth what are you made of could you handle it this is what this movie is all about dr ryan stone played by sandra bullock she is one of two main characters in the movie i never once got the impression that she was acting nor did i see any bad acting that spoiled the scene she is a doctor not particularly a life long employee of nasa so she relies on veteran astronaut matt kowalsky played by george clooney his acting well is very similar to his other acting in so many movies cool calm and collected and well played he gives advice to dr ryan on many times she is wired with emotions he is not both are fantastic actors however i would like to see a movie where just once george clooney loses it that would be fun although the plot is fairly simple taking us through it is not what technology will fail what can be improvised this is probably not a movie that you would see twice unless you really wanted to try and find the few tiny glitches in acting or perhaps some scenes where inertia and gravity theories dont seem quite right and you wanted a second look i suppose there might be a few of those but that would miss the true point of the movie in the end the real point is that you too will thank the earth for everything she has given you bravo 
i had the pleasure of seeing this film during its theatrical release in d and have wondered just how well it would hold up on home video after viewing it on my computer i can say without question that this is one of the best movie experiences ive ever had even when reduced to a smaller screen with no d i had no trouble with the streaming from amazon and the picture was in clear hd all the way sandra bullock delivers the performance of her career as an astronaut caught in a disaster with seemingly no hope of rescue george clooney is also quite good as the commander of the mission who along with bullock must leave their destroyed shuttle in order to reach the international space station this film clocks in at under minutes not including credits and it does not let you go for a minute even during the quiet times there is the relentless pressure that is constantly being cranked up as bullock and clooney must race the clock to get back to earth alfonso cuaron co wrote and directed this film and like many of his previous works he manages to create a marvelous world that we inhabit with these wonderful characters when you consider that we only see two people alive a third astronaut is shown but we never see his face entirely for nearly minutes it is quite remarkable just how much faith is placed in the actors yet with two pros like bullock and clooney this is really a piece of cake for them as they effortlessly carry the film if anything this film really shows just how few actors can pull something this like off so easily the world of gravity is one that is both familiar and yet non existent we have not flown space shuttles for a few years yet according to the sts mission in the film it is set in roughly the chinese station that is mentioned does exist but is not nearly as complete as depicted so gravity takes place in an alternate world that we can certainly relate this may be due to the fact that the script had been first written several years ago but only now was cuaron able to make it a reality the cgi is naturally compelling and excitingly rendered but the core of gravity is that at its heart it is an experimental film the opening shot lasts for over minutes unbroken and completely mesmerizing as we are introduced to these characters we also switch points of view from being far away from the action to actually seeing whats happening through bullocks eyes bullock herself wears little in terms of makeup and for the first time her true age does show through but that is an asset and not a detriment to the actress who delivers a powerful heartfelt and incisive performance that makes you really wonder why she was not even on the short list of actresses for this role plus without giving anything away the final sequence in the film is yet another experimental effect that is really quite profound when you understand what the director had in mind i realize that some people will not like this movie and i can understand why with all the hype about how it cannot live up to those expectations it didnt help that i read a critics review comparing bullocks performance to that of rene marie falconetti in the passion of joan of arc which is arguably the greatest performance ever filmed no bullock is not that good but its wonderful to see the emotions cascade across her face and even the tacked on bit of background to bullocks character about her daughter manages to pay off later in the film there is hardly a false note or any sense of a wasted shot cuaron does the seemingly impossible by directing a film that includes everything that is needed and not one thing more i cannot say if this is the best film of since i have not seen all the nominees however this film is a true game changer in terms of just how to create an action disaster film i have little doubt that big budget cgi films that are in the planning stages are taking lessons from how to create a true thrill ride from this movie to me gravity is more than just a great thrill ride however i actually felt like i had never seen a film before while i was gripping the arms of my chair a very rare feeling indeed 
the performances in this movie were superb and the special effects extremely interesting i interpreted the movie as something of a depiction of an avatar experience for the woman astronaut since the circumstances presented were so obviously impossible to survive it is interesting to think that the ability to realistically depict physics and make magical extrapolations seamlessly that introduce fantasy point to great improvements that have been made in movie making in recent years and the possibility that it will not be long before at least for wealthy individuals able to afford it such exciting avatar experiences may be open not just as movie depictions but seamlessly woven into individual lives to experience fantasy worlds in a realistic way this film points in a new direction for imagination from books to movies to actual immersion in a fantasy experience 
gravity is to me one of the big surprises of the year out of all the hyped up films this year or even this season this movie was the one of ones i did not really care to see it looked slightly cool from the trailer but i thought i could easily wait to see it on dvd however as the film was coming out i saw all the reviews and positive feedback the film was getting gravity has about a on rotten tomatoes at the moment and reviewers i listen to on youtube gave it really high marks so with this film doing so well critically i thought i d be remiss if i did not see this film in the theatre i will say that this film should definitely be seen in theatres or imax or you will be missing out this film was a really pleasant surprise for me the film looks amazing has characters you care for it keeps you on the edge of your seat and has a great atmosphere the story is as follows you have this group of astronauts headed by matt george clooney and dr ryan stone sandra bullock who are on a mission to make modifications on the hubble space telescope however mission control played by ed harris informs them that the russians blew up one of their own satellites which caused a chain reaction which caused other satellites to go down and that the debris is heading right for them the shuttle gets hit and everyone dies except for ryan and matt now these two have to survive and get back to earth first of all the film looks brilliant i just watched it in d so i can only imagine how it looks in d i do not have a theatre around here that has d so i cannot watch it in that format i would think it would be pretty scary in d i heard the d is amazing so see the film in d if you can the cgi is great it actually feels like you are in space throughout the entire film you get many beautiful birds eye view shots of earth the action you get is great as well and it keeps you on edge this film does an outstanding job at building suspense literally every five minutes there is a suspenseful moment that keeps you on edge and it keeps that up until the very end of the film the audience barely gets a chance to breathe between all these dire situations sandra bullock is put through the characters are both likable and ones you easily get attached to you really feel sorry for sandra bullock s character having to be in such a situation is very horrible and i liked how she dealt with it all some may complain that she is to whiny in the beginning but if anyone was put in that situation we would be just as frightened as she was if not more so this movie made me never want to go into space george clooney s character is also very likable he is pretty much the voice of reason for ryan and he helps her throughout the film he is also very laid back and a bit funny as well which you welcome in a film like this i really like george clooney as an actor he has done some film that i really do not like batman and robin but he also has done some movies i like this one regardless of the movie he is in i always like him though overall gravity is a must see film you definitely should see in on the big screen in d or imax if you can however the film does work well in d as well the film is definitely a wild ride 
let s put it this way gravity is now in my top three favorite films of all time previously my top three were the empire strikes back l a confidential and casablanca gravity is now in that top three although it s spot is being internally debated it s that good if you haven t seen the trailers for it the film is about a group of astronauts who are hit by satellite debris and have to fight for survival if you ve seen the trailer you re aware how intense gravity looks well it lives up to the expectations and then exceeds them by leaps and bounds gravity is without a doubt the single most intense beautiful and literally breathtaking film i ve ever seen i ve been a huge fan of director alfonso cuar oacute n ever since i saw harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban my first taste of his amazing style and vision i was further convinced of his masterful sense of filmmaking after seeing children of men and his breakthrough y tu mam aacute tambi eacute n cuar oacute n not only has fantastic style but one of his trademarks are now incredibly long single take tracking shots most people don t notice long single takes and that there isn t a cut if it s done well gravity continues this incredible feat with a minute opening shot it s a remarkable feat and you become absolutely lost in the film seconds into it it s a breathtaking film filled with some of the most beautiful cinematography in recent memory sandra bullock plays the heroine ryan stone in a riveting performance i haven t seen a more worthy oscar performance yet this year george clooney as matt kowalski is also great adding a sense of humor and calm to a chaotic situation arguably most impressive about the film is it s attention to detail and realism yes it s a work of fiction and some scientific artistic merits were taken to advance the story but ultimately it stays true to the realities of space no sound no gravity no oxygen life can not exist there these truths constantly run through your mind as you watch the characters struggle and fight for survival the musical score is powerful and terrifying amping up the reality of the scenes unfolding before you i was clenching my armrest and reminding myself to breath throughout the film it is without a doubt a remarkable piece of filmmaking if you re able to handle the intense and nerve rattling story it s an absolute must see just remember to breathe note i saw it in d and on a huge screen if you re able to see it in d you really should it isn t gimmicky d it just adds astounding depth to a visually remarkable film 
theatrical review there may be spoilers see below for blu ray update most movie lovers can remember seeing a film for the first time that really got their attention usually it was in a real movie theater for me it was a space odyssey the juxtaposition of a flung femur bone transfiguring into a space shuttle lining up to dock at an orbiting station all to the backdrop of classical music was mind blowing to this science fiction lover a few year later sitting in a large theater i was again mesmerized by a giant space ship moving slowly across dark space star wars episode iv a new hope had a new technical trick at its disposal dolby surround sound a new generation will likely have gravity to look back on yes its that good director alfonso cuaron children of men who also wrote the screenplay with his son jonas has managed to provide an electrifying thriller with a basic story a flight crew headed by lt a lieutenant really matt kowalski george clooney have been sent to repair the hubble telescope the scientist in charge of the repairs is the ever so serious dr ryan stone sandra bullock there are no other actors who have any role of substance other than the voice of ed harris at mission control early on in a quick turn of events it is learned that the russians have destroyed one of their spy satellites the explosion has set off a chain reaction of debris hurtling through space taking out other satellites along the way with only minutes to react kowalskis crew attempt to get the shuttle out of orbit they dont now in survival mode kowalski and stone must figure out how to get back to earth this becomes even more complicated as radio communication with mission control has been severed cuaron provides sandra bullock an opportunity to show her acting range and she responds with a performance that will be remembered for a long time stones early panic as the space debris knocks her away from kowalski and the shuttle comes across to the audience we see the terror in her eyes in her breathing and in the fogging helmet shield the other star of the film is cuarons cinematographer emmanuel lubezki and the visual and special effects department it is the most amazing thing i think ive ever seen on screen and yes see it now dont wait for this movie to come to you by netflix and yes see it in d i pick and choose when to spend an extra or dollars on d and i made the right decision here gravity has several meanings the most used and obvious one for this movie has to do with the force of bodies falling toward earth but gravity also is defined as a serious or critical nature also serious or dignified behavior all apply cuaron and his team will likely need a truck to load nominations come oscar time dont miss it blu ray update i recently acquired a d television and having swooned over this film d in theaters last fall i couldnt think of a better movie to test out the display it didnt disappoint the package includes d and d options separate discs and a dvd it also includes a digital hd ultraviolet download the special features are on the d disc im not surprised that the film retains the awe inspiring luster of the theatrical version it comes with p resolution and a aspect ratio the d much like the big screen version uses the extra dimension to create depth of space which is certainly appropriate for a film which takes place in space orbiting around earth the color and sometimes lack of is excellent along with deep dark blacks shadows are in proper contrast and detail is remarkable check out hair stubble on clooneys face and watch bullock as she strains once reaching the temporary safety of the international space station her neck muscles stretch and relax great acting and great cinematography i cant say enough about the d element here frankly im not a big fan as a rule still there are a few that get it right avatar and hugo come to mind gravity joins the club while i did not watch the d version from beginning to end i did see enough to that nothing is lost other than the depth in either case the discs are demo quality likewise the dts hd master audio track is flawless it does a perfect job handling the big collision scenes and the subwoofer certainly got a workout in that regard along with the surrounds but there are other elements well played out that i didnt notice as much the first time around first is the use of silence director cuaron and his oscar winning sound squad have done a marvelous job not only creating some unusual sounds but have integrated them beautifully into the various elements of the film one second there are loud collisions total silence the next the sound of small fires starting and the whoosh of a fire extinguisher or a jet propulsion pack its just incredible the other major element so important in the film is the soundtrack by another oscar winner steven price it never resorts to an overabundance of strings but it emphasizes the emotions and terrors of the moment the lossless audio track handles it perfectly subtitles are available in english sdh french spanish and portuguese there are a host of extras gravity mission control hd minutes a behind the scenes documentary segments include it began with a story initial challenges long shots and zero g previsualizing gravity the hues of space physical weightlessness space tech sandra and george a pair in

gravity is a pretty easy movie to sum up beautiful visuals thanks to convincing cgi great acting and a musical score that adds so much to what you are seeing there is not too much of a story other than survival in space though some character development emerges as the movie goes along sandra bullock delivers a performance that should get her another oscar nomination her acting here is very natural and believable george clooney is likeable and a perfect contrast to bullocks uptight and nervous character i expect to see gravity up for multiple awards picture director actress visuals effects and numerous other technical ones sure it is more of a thrill ride than a structured movie but it is unlike any movie ive ever seen especially in imax d 
the sfx of this movie are amazing at several moments i thought to myself they must have filmed in space or how did they do that story was great the actors sandra bullock and george clooney are amazing if you can watch in imax d i believe it was made for imax it is worth the price if you do not have an imax theaters near by try at least watching in d is an amazing experience the director did a great job keeping everything realistic even the use of sound in space no sound and inside the astronaut suit very cooloverall is a must see movie 
when i initially read about the movie gravity coming to theaters i had no doubt it would be an interesting film however for me it was not a must see i grouped it that selection of films that i would see in the theater if friends wanted to go see it or i happened to be downtown one day with time to spare and the film was about the play once i saw it was only minutes along an unheard of running time in this era of hour films it move higher on my list since the time investment would not be that great all i can say is that i am incredibly glad i did go see this film on the big screen starring mega wattage actors george clooney and sandra bullock gravity is the story of a routine space shuttle mission that goes horribly wrong when a russian attempt to dispose of one of their own satellites is botched triggering a chain reaction of debris that threatens everything in orbit and devastates the shuttle clooney and bullock are the only survivors remaining and their desperate goal is to find a way to outlast the debris storm and find a passage back to earth using any of the available means that have not yet been destroyed the wonderment of space the race against time and the feeling of claustrophobia are common thematic elements since the beginning of cinema in the hands of a lesser director they could be mishandled and come off as badly clich eacute d fortunately the expert hands of alfonso cuaron children of men and y tu mama tambien manages to hit the right chord with every narrative development the breathless tension remains high throughout the film and cuaron takes no shortcuts in showcasing the challenges the survivors face the acting is first rate in this film it s not hard to see sandra bullock receiving an academy award nomination for her performance what also helps strengthen gravity is that the science in the film for the most part is sound too many space based films play fast and loose with the laws of physics yet with the exception of a couple of deviations made for narrative purposes gravity remains true the final aspect of this film that will captivate audiences is the stunning visual experience gravity is one of those films that needs to be experienced on the big screen and if possible in d it is a piece of cinema that knows how to use d in service of the story instead of as a gimmick to distract the audience the experience of this visual drama is one that will stay with you long after you leave the theater as the scenes replay in your mind over and over again 
spoiler alert a great movie about survival in space after everything imaginable has gone wrong her spirit crashes over her lost daughter from years previous after space debry destroys her shuttle she manages to survive 
i just got back from watching gravity and i am still in awwww ryan sandra bullock and matt george clooney are on a space walk when debris hit the area they are working on causing them be detached from their ship and spin off in space while trying to figure out a way to get home ryan has one heck of a fight on her hands sandra bullock does a phenomenal job in this film and i am sure she will get an oscar nomination if not the award itself for best actress whats even more phenomenal is how she carries the entire film herself with very little or no interaction from other people when you add the d element to this movie combined with the stunning visuals and wonderful performances it just takes you on that emotional journey even more this is the type of film that showcases what d can do when given the right material i will not give away any of the movie as to not spoil for those who have not seen it yet i do highly recommend this work of art that is nothing short of a brilliant masterpiece that will truly immerse you and leave you breathless at times 
a movie with such a title that is about the scary and dark void called space youd expect to be thrilling well i have to tell you this movie is beyond thrilling this film is a perfect combination of matrix and inception and will pump your adrenaline to a maximum level gravity is a life time experience that everyone must see if you add to the mix that sandra bullock and george clooney star in it as main characters it just doesnt get better than that since this movie has so many genres its hard to tell its main one this movie has adventure comedy sorrow suspense thrilling scenes intense scary scenes and so much more the main one out of all these fantastic genres is definitely suspense you walk in feeling bored and tired and you walk out feeling like ryan stone in the movie sandra bullock the thrilling adventure begins when a young medical engineer named ryan stone goes up in space to help with installations for the hubble telescope it seems like a casual spacewalk but when she gets stranded away from her ship explorer she needs to get back to earth by hitching a ride on a different station if you want to find out how and if she and her co worker matt kowalski george clooney make it back to earth alive you have to watch the film the movie has so much adventure and so many impressive and clear graphics its hard not to like it you feel like you are right there experiencing whatever the main characters experience the acting is amazing and there is deep meaning behind it what would you do if you were alone in the deepest and darkest part of this entire universe with nobody but yourself what would your thoughts be would you be able to remain hopeful or just give up and let space take you the camera work is the best ive ever seen alfonso cuar oacute n i give you standing ovation for directing this masterpiece my favorite scene is when ryan is stuck in a damaged escape pod with no fuel she thinks shes stranded before she decides to give up and loose hope of returning to earth she starts to see matt matt gets in when she does not have her helmet on and shows her that she can get back as soon as his statement is over hes gone she hallucinated him but the plan worked its a very interesting and important scene in the movie and thats why i like it the movie is rated pg and i honestly think it is appropriate for age to i give it out of stars and it is showing in theaters everywhere right now i may be wrong but i predict oscar nominations for the cast and director of gravity lets see what happens in reviewed by kids first film critic gerry o for more youth reviews go to kidsfirst org
this film is one of the best ive seen for multiple reasons the acting both george clooney and sandra bullock do a fine work the music fits like a glove and perhaps worth owning by itself the cinematography brilliant work that helps set your mind in it from start to finish d done well action keeps moving at a pace to keep us in it a story we get it well written i wanted to see it again almost immediately this is a sign of a great film

alfonso cuaron a brilliant craftsman recently won oscars directing editing gravity is visceral entertainment obviously no amount of blu ray rendering is going to match its impact on the big screen 
i first heard about the movie gravity from phil plaits bad astronomy website hes a real stickler for scientifically accurate movies and what hed heard about gravity had him very enthused early on so early in the morning on the day of release i went down to the theater caught the first non imax d showing and was blown away lets start with the opening visuals of earth from orbit gorgeous that alone was worth the ticket price it gets better as the shuttle and its crew come into view once the accident occurs and the two surviving astronauts find themselves in a desperate situation i was astounded by how realistic the physics felt for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and in space things behave very differently from what were used to here on the ground the way the astronauts yo yoed about on their tethers as they tried to grab onto each other or onto a nearby structure had my heart pounding a common complaint from purists about space movies is the all too familiar sound of whooshing spaceships or the ear splitting thuds as things explode not in gravity the only sounds heard in vacuum are those transmitted by the spacesuits when things explode the music is what heightens the drama the two main characters were played by george clooney and sandra bullock and they do a fine job of acting perfectly believable throughout the film enough said as phil plait pointed out on his site gravity does stretch the science in a few places in real life it would be virtually impossible to get from the orbit of the hubble space telescope to that of the international space station thats why during the final telescope servicing mission they actually had a spare shuttle ready on the launching pad just in case the astronauts needed rescue but obviously there would be no movie if the producers insisted on this level of accuracy so they fudged things a bit no matter as for the pg rating its warranted this is one very intense movie are you old enough to remember the first time you saw jaws in the theater back in remember the way everyone shrieked when that severed head popped out of the hole in the side of the boat well there are a couple of comparable scenes in gravity early on no one shrieked but it was definitely gruesome theres also a bit of language but nothing i cant imagine myself saying if i were suddenly cast adrift in a space accident all in all this one is well worth the seeing and im glad i did but with this level of intensity could i stand another viewing maybe if i go with a friend 
ryan stone is having trouble truly living since her daughters death she just doesnt have the desire to find joy she a bio medical engineer is on her first expedition as an astronaut as she is outside the shuttle repairing the hubble telescope debris from a russian satellite does a lot more damage to equipment than expected she is left alone to survive in space she has to face her terror and take some chances in order to save herself this movie is basically sandra bullocks soliloquy she carries this movie single handedly and she does a great job too george clooney has a small but important role in this film which he pulls off perfectly the special effects are very very convincing and i found myself lost in the action of this movie i watched the d version but sadly i did not see much difference that effect was lost on me this is a terrifying yet tender movie about a woman discovering her hidden strength and desire to live this is a feel good movie i loved it 
i came out of this film thinking this is the best film ive ever seen in my life and im over so ive seen a lot of films and then i read the reviews here and find that a lot of other people felt the same way this isnt a movie that people just like all the reviews say something like the best film of the year the best film ever of its genre this film is the most perfect film ive ever seen in just about every way an extraordinary film im in awe etc there arent many movies that get reviews like this you just have to see this film in d with the silly glasses and dont think oh ill wait and see it when it comes on on dvd etc because you will get just of the experience the experience of seeing this movie on the big screen in d is what you want please dont miss it because you will regret it forever an extraordinary film 
as in watching the film all is lost while watching gravity my head kept screaming at the errors in the thought or technology etc yet in both films they compelled me to shut my fact based brain up and just root for the sole hero heroine i knew it was impossible that s he could survive but really really wanted them to against absolute certainty of failure total props to sandra bullock for taking this role shes the only one who could compel so many to see it and believe it same with robert redford in all is lost just terrific 
many people dont take science fiction seriously but heres a movie that might work for those who dont usually like the genre there are no aliens unknown worlds monsters or laser shootouts this is a movie thats set in the real world or more accurately above it the story opens with a george clooney voice over we meet astronauts working to repair a satellite this shows how calm such a silent world can be i reluctantly saw the movie in d but this was one occasion that i came away feeling that it added to the experience it almost made me dizzy seeing ryan stone bullock and matt kowalski clooney go about their routine business with earth looming large in the background indeed the cinematography was breathtaking throughout the minutes i dont want to give away too many details but if you have seen the trailer or even looked at the poster youll know that this movie is far from being a calm ride an accident sends debris racing toward the astronauts like some kind of deadly shrapnel what follows is a story about the strength of the human spirit and the will to survive against all odds remember that the word gravity has more than one meaning while i enjoyed sandra bullocks performances in the blind side and speed i would hardly describe myself as a fan however i left the theater thinking that she carried the whole movie and its easily the most accomplished performance of her career alfonso cuar oacute n directed y tu mam aacute tambi eacute n children of men and the best harry potter movie azkaban but this is comfortably my favorite from his impressive portfolio the story is lean gripping thoughtful thrilling scary breathtaking beautiful and emotional and feels perfectly paced at every point he doesnt insult us by giving too much exposition and that draws us deeper into the story his use of extreme close ups is another reason we are drawn to these characters its hard to avoid feeling that you are a part of the movie as i watched i thought of a space odyssey moon apollo cast away alien and a few other great movies cuar oacute n lets us see his characters thinking and thats a good thing remember that astronauts are not selected because they are stupid or incapable of adapting in extreme situations im always impressed when i see a movie which takes the trouble to show how people really think its not an easy thing to do well this choice works perfectly and helps the whole story succeed because its so believable although the visuals dazzled on a regular basis my favorite shot in the whole movie was sandra bullock in the fetal position it jumped out at me as being so appropriate for the scene and it was a stroke of genius youll know what i mean when you see it the opening titles remind us that there is no sound in space just as kubrick depicted almost years ago i admire this movie so much that i would happily watch it again tomorrow its a wild minutes i left the theater feeling as if it was an effort to be back in the real world i was totally immersed in the story to the point of being almost unable to function when it was over im glad i had a long walk back to the car so that i could catch my breath there are so many reasons to see this movie even if you hate science fiction it wont be forgotten when the awards season arrives see it immediately i would even go as far to say you should see it in d 
this movie features an unbelievable adventure this is a d space movie the d is not obtrusive but actually helps the movie as it progresses the movie was co written co produced co edited and directed by alfonso cuar oacute n it stars sandra bullock and george clooney as astronauts who survive a damaged space shuttle the movie features something like an odyssey going from a shuttle to the international space station to sandra bullock makes a good case for an oscar nomination she does a tour de force in her role i am not sure that her recollection of her daughter helps a great deal but it does humanize her clooney does a fine job as her partner as things go from bad to worse things in the movie look bad they get worse the special effects are wonderful the tension is gripping the movie moves ahead with a momentum that is compelling this is one fine movie well worth attending to 
gravity at first you feel the peace and the serenity and you wish you were up there no noise drifting and free detached from the earth and all its earthbound problems it is just you and the endlessness of space a little later the serenity and peace give way to a cold and forsaken place far away from any other being and the d experience on a huge imax screen make you feel lost and desperate and you want to scream and panic with sandra bullock but you know that no one hears you it all felt so real the tumbling around every drop from her tears floating right at the audience every piece of debris flying at you the speed of it all and the millions of stars surrounding you with no orientation about what is up or down this was so real so captivating we went twice and the second time was even better the first time you are just taken away to and it felt like i held my breath for the duration of the movie the second time i realized much more details in george clooneys character and his heroism and the complexity of their relationship and how he saved her even in spirit loved this movie love imax which makes this experience so real it feels not like watching it it feels like experiencing it 
i remember when i saw the first trailer for gravity my wife thought it looked stupid i thought it could go in several directions so i thought i would keep an open mind from that trailer you would likely come to several conclusions first you might think the movie was trying a bit too hard to be dramatic you also might conclude that it would be a terrifying graphic horror story of a sci fi you also might conclude that it would have overblown acting and direction that tries too hard to be edgy in addition to dramatic and yet you might also conclude that this film would be different from the sci fi that has come before and break new ground if it met its seemly lofty ambitions well the film is out and it is nothing you feared and everything you might have hoped for and more the most beautiful realistic science fiction yet filmedthe film begins and you are treated to the most astounding cgi optical special effects yet seen for realistic astronaut work spacewalk a single long long shot allows the scene to unfold the sheer beauty of the scenes visuals opens our eyes to how astoundingly beautiful the earth must be from orbit throughout the film if you have any appreciation at all for cinematography visual effects and just plain splendid film visuals in general you will be amazing the way the opening sceene unfolds is more than that though its great film making the astronauts talk mission control advises the the astronauts go about their daily work and then all heck breaks loose what do i do what do i do if youve watched any of the trailers for this film you should know by now that its a disaster movie in space in a space of moments events transpire that take everything from tranquil to terrifying if you were to judge this film based on trailer alone though you would miss something very important indeed from a two minute snippet of a film like this you can see the build up you are acclimated to a situation then the music the visuals the dialog and perfect direction quickly make you feel the gravity of the situation in zero gravity object have momentum and inertia until they are acted up by an outside force in plain speak this means if something is moving miles per hour and heading your way it keeps rocketing at that speed until it slams into you with unimaginable force likewise if something is moving only miles per hour in zero g it just keeps right on coming and unless you have friction thrust you wont change velocity until that thing again slams right into you when the only thing keeping you alive is a few centimeters of cloth and a tank of oxygen thats absolutely terrifying and the director makes you feel it see it hear it and experience it with amazing realism while mileage will of course vary i am of the personal opinion that sandra bullock gives the performance of a lifetime and one that will define her entire career as the newbie astronaut ryan and george clooney is splendid as the veteran astronaut matt they both come across as believable and as i watched the film i felt very much taken along for the journey thinking about just what i would do if i were in that situation i hate space now if you have ever seen a disaster movie in your life you know that they are a series of unfortunately coincidences one after another that keep the protagonist on the edge of near death with some breaks in between now and then so you can catch your breath this film does not stray too far from that formula except perhaps that it is directed less like a disaster film no interventions from unexpected sources to save the day and the dangers are all environmental psychological so you wont have to worry about any psychopaths with knives insane robots on the loose etc some people have said that this film is completely predictable and others have said it is completely original the truth lies somewhere in between i have often been very irritated that people continue to blast a film simply because it uses tropes tropes are not bad and embrace something that hasnt been very well done simply because it isnt familiar to them what i am trying to say is this film is not original in the story it tells weve had movies about survival against all odds in a crisis situation for a long time weve had a few decent films about real world space travel as well what we have not had is a film this well made about this story told in this amazing way houston i have a bad feeling about this mission some people have justifiably complained about scientific inaccuracies in this film the objects of certain objects arent correct or are in the wrong direction the likelihood of a debris field of a certain size being created as a result of an impact in space a payload specialist being called a mission specialist the fact that the main character does not act like an astronaut and acts more like you or i would yeah some things bothered me too if you know anything about nasa a mission specialist trains like crazy they dont let failures or people with obvious psychological issues on spaceflights unless again they are just there to do one thing in which case they arent trained at all for spaceflight maneuvering if any astronauts want to correct me my source is wikipedia but after seeing the movie all the way through none of that matters for one thing this film is just far enough off from the real world that i can call its setting an alternate near future earth earth if you will in such a world everything that happens in the film is possible its possible that nasa runs out of money and skimps on training but gives a bit of extra training for emergencies its possible that orbits are adjusted for one reason or another and yes its possible that collisions happen create a catastrophic debris field and a person has to fight to survive the cold vacuum of space and that possibility is what makes this film so darn amazing when you see objects moving spinning acting upon each other it is all incredibly real with a very small suspension of disbelief you can swallow everything that happens and just go along for the ride enjoying that under the exact circumstances of the film everything would transpire exact as seen or as a book on writing sci fi that i once read said you can setup whatever rules you want for your story you just have to obey them either way its going to be one hell of a ride this is one wild roller coaster of a movie and it uses every trick at the directors disposal to make you take this amazing journey you will taken inside of an astronauts helmet and be able to read the indicators in their hud you will watch objects burn up into the atmosphere you will be with an astronaut as they tumble and spin out of control out of breath terrified out of their mind and the beautiful compelling thrilling reality of it all will take your breath away there are moments in this film that will stick with you forever on this journey you will follow an astronauts psychological death and rebirth spelled out in visuals that will easily make this among the highest ranked science fiction masterpieces ever made there is no sound in space though there is in the trailer it is not there in the movie the only sound effects are what a person inside a suit or spaceship would hear the music more than makes up for it listening to it will make your heart pound there is no closet horror here no zombie hordes or dinosaur jack in the box that leaps into view and it isnt needed the thrill of an escalating situation in space is all the terror you need but thankfully this film is more thrilling than terrifying you will feel stressed but you will not feel drained you will be taken to a low point and then your spirit will sail up into the sky along with the protagonist this film is not a downer it will make you want to cheer its time to stop driving its time to go home within the story of survival there is another story a story of a woman who has given up on life and is just going through the motions and now has to make a decision about whether or not she wants to live whether its worth the harrowing journey to survive and walk out the other side of the cold dark tunnel some people may think this story is cliche or boring or unnecessary i think its humanizing compelling and inspiring ill make a confession i am a sandra bullock fan i fell in love with her as a teen in while you were sleeping ive followed her career since then and for me at least she has always made an otherwise unwatchable movie one that i could enjoy not a fan of miss congeniality or the blind side but i watched both movies for her ive been waiting though for the movie that i would love her in more than anything she has ever done much like im still waiting for the movie daniel craig or jennifer lawrence will be in that is good enough for me to want to own for a reason other than that hes in it and i like him well for me this is that movie sandra bullock is but she has never been in better form she is gorgeous in this movie a perfect representative for all women of humanity i told you this was high calibur sci fi she is at turns normal helpless determined angry lost strong and at last triumphantly spiritually transcendent ultimately this is not a battle against the elements but a battle against herself and the conclusion is awe inspiring the music the visuals and the actor combine to create scenes that are downright iconic and the as i said the end of this film will make you want to cheer after seeing this film i could not stop thinking about i cannot stop talking about it when it comes out on blu ray i will buy it and treasure it forever i had thought no film could be better than oblivion this year but this film is better and here i thought for any film to be better than that one was impossible silly me do yourself a favor go out to a theater immediately and see this film great compelling entertaining glorious art like this deserves to be seen appreciated and celebrated oh and it deserves to win academy awards for best actress best director best script best cinematography best visual effects best musical score and definitely best picture 
spoiler alert bewarethis movie was incredibly realistic i am not intelligent or brave enough to ever be an astronaut this movie hit me hard in my imagination heart and gut all at once the polish astronaut was so manly handsome clever brave he reminded me of an irish rogue i would have given him the medal of honor posthumously for what he did man has no greater love than to lay down his life for his fellow man this is what sci fi movies should be about they should be imaginative didactic even if they made sci fi movie like this i would watch them all over and over and over again 
gravity director alphonso cuar oacute n said that after this he will never make another space movie thankfully the space movie that he did make is nothing short of spectacular and should certainly make any director think twice before making the next space movie superlatives abound when describing the intensity and the mind blowing visual effects of gravity set in space gravity opens with the words life in space is impossible and five better words do not exist to serve as prologue for the film that follows doctor ryan stone sandra bullock and astronaut matt kowalski george clooney are on a nasa satellite repair mission kilometers above earths surface when rogue debris from a russian satellite detonation rip through their station at mph decimating their ship and sending the astronauts hurdling into space cuar oacute n majestically dazzles the viewer in the opening scene with epic silence sweeping camera movements and sensory immersion that rivals that of stanley kubricks a space odyssey he magnifies the strangeness and utter complexity of being suspended in space as stone and kowalski are shown performing a variety of tasks as they complete their mission while communicating via radio between each other and their contact at mission control in houston ed harris the peaceful serene tone of the films first ten minutes is mesmerizing but unsettling as a twinge of impending doom is resting uneasily in the audiences mind the thrilling contrast of the sudden catastrophe that befalls stone and kowalski is also handled with pure terror tonal comparisons can be made to the film open water where primal fear is explored as two scuba divers are abandoned in the middle of the ocean hundreds of miles from shore gravity taps into that same primal fear with expertise and style gravity is a true cinematic ride while not deep in content the film is absorbing terrifying and authentic clooney and bullock carry the movie with ease and with a tight running time of minutes the small cast merely emphasizes the ironically claustrophobic nature of space cuar oacute ns choices of point of view are magnificent as he allows the camera to effortlessly and seamlessly transition in and out of first person at the most opportune times few films give an audience such awareness and consciousness in once scene bullocks character is suddenly sent spinning into deep space she loses radio communication and the camera assumes bullocks point of view the audience abruptly is thrown into a very real experience of spinning attempting to gain a point of reference discovering oxygen levels are low and likely literally holding their breath this is a movie to experience in a theater agravity is rated pg and has a running time of hour and minutes see it on the largest screen possible it is playing in imax and xtreme theaters and can be seen in both d and d the peoples critic saw the film in d but many critics say this is a film worthy of the d surcharge 
really enjoyed this movie and having it in both formats is really helpful this was really interesting to watch and one well visit again in the next few months i am sure 
every now and again there comes a film that shakes things up it is called ground breaking monumental and the film that everyone should see so what film has the privilege of gaining such praise why that would be alfonso cuarons gravity the man behind films like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban and children of men not only helms gravity but he also produced and co wrote this space thriller when the movie made its way to festival circuits viewers were awed for months now gravity has had nothing but praised from the likes of critics and filmmakers that kind of one sided critiquing is something that catches my eye so was gravity truly a masterpiece masterpiece may not be the best term for this film but more or less the story of gravity is quite simple if you have seen the trailers or tv spots then thats all you need to know about the plot however if you missed any of the films advertisement allow me to indulge you ryan stone sandra bullock finds herself in a heap of trouble after an accident above earths orbit leaves her stranded in space with no build up gravity throws you right into the thick of things in the first ten minutes the satellite is destroyed and sandra bullock finds herself adrift in space normally i would be bothered by such a thing but in case of gravity it works while i believe there are some themes in the film they are used with a subtly and dont play a major role in the overall plot when it comes down to it gravity has a thrilling story from start to finish and it certainly works in the films favor its never easy to carry the stage by yourself but sandra bullock showed that she can in this thriller while this technically a two man show the perspective is center on bullocks character and she does all the work if sandra is not at least nominated for best actress for the upcoming oscars i will be surprised why well it is one thing to play a strong character it is another to play a strong character in a different environment and that is exactly what sandra bullock does dont worry im not leaving out george clooney while im not biggest clooney fan and i felt that george was being george his role as matt kowalski was great for a supporting character still at the end of the day i have to take my hat off to sandra bullock there is no other way to put this gravity has to be one the most technically sound films i have ever seen cuarons use of camerawork was awe inspiring where we are so use to a clip to clip format in movies gravity used longer cuts and showed so much in each sequence the first person shots were used so well it could make a some first person shooters jealous there was some questionable cg but it didnt hurt the overall film what certainly help the film were the visuals gravity had some of the best shots of earth i have ever seen captured on the silver screen then there is the films d alright i will be the first to admit that im not the biggest fan of d if you can i suggest seeing a movie in your standard d however gravity has my stamp of approval of being a must see in d the film used the effect to best of its abilites from having things fly in your face to just seeing things stand out gravitys d is worth every penny if i had to pick which scene was my favorite it would have to be the destruction of the space station the sequence was thrilling and the both the camera and the d made the destruction of the iss that more impressive the only scene i thought was weak was when ryan is speaking to the farmer i found scene hard to follow though i did understand why it was there the title above says it all gravity is a definition of a movie experience sure the movie may not have the most solid of stories but everything in this film works this is a must see in theaters and if you can check it out in imax my hat goes off to everyone apart of this project as gravity is one best movie of the year you can also see he review here 
 i hate space ryan stone bullock is a medical engineer who is working in space on an experiment she is up there with astronaut matt kowalski on his last mission and trying to break the space walk record when ground control warns them of incoming debris stone thinks she can finish before they are hit she is wrong when a rouge particle hits the arm she is on she becomes detached from the shuttle and her crew floating alone in space she does everything she can to make it back home safe this is a hard movie to review the main reason is because i dont want to give anything away this is one of if not the most tense movie i think i have ever seen five minutes into the movie the action starts and doesnt stop until the end i found myself white knuckled and holding my breath almost the entire time there are very few movies that i have a hard time talking about this is one of them words cant do this justice this is easily one of the best movies of the year an absolute must see and the best d movie i have ever seen overall nothing else to say but wow watch this i give it an a 
after over two years of waiting and hoping we finally set course gravity tells a story about survival loneliness with a grieving character ryan stone the film focuses on the pleasures of space but also the fear that it can bring some may say the film lacks in story and instead is big on visuals i disagree the visuals themselves are used as characters and emotions bullock was phenomenal and if she were not to get a nomination for an oscar i would be surprised though i would not be surprised if she won clooney to does an excellent job being the spirit that guides bullock stone in her journey through the silence and uncertainty of space all in all this film is breathtaking from many areas visually and emotionally this is a film that will stand in time as the best space film created to date and will also be beloved by audiences of all generations in short an instant classic 
director alfonso cuar oacute ns latest work gravity is about two astronauts lost in outer space the simple premise is not only intriguing but plausible and it is also very ambitious as the film virtually features only two characters its three if you include the voice of ground control by ed harris a nod to ron howards apollo having lost their space shuttle two astronauts dr ryan stone sandra bullock and lieutenant matt kowalski george clooney have to figure out how to come back to the earth alive while floating in the outer space for dr stone who is a medical engineer this is her first mission in space which makes the situation even more difficult the storyline especially its second half is admittedly less convincing than the brilliant first part the script written by alfonso cuar oacute n and his son jon aacute s cuar oacute n but gravity remains a thrilling ride throughout thanks to the stunning visuals and strong acting from sandra bullock alfonso cuar oacute n focuses more on the characters and the zero g environment that is harsh to them than the action sequences involving spaceships like duncan jones moon gravity is a sci fi drama with a more plausible premise with an emphasis on characters and it is brilliantly done 
 this review may contain spoilers very few american films today classified as entertainment actually can rise to the level of art gravity the new sci fi space odyssey like thriller starring sandra bullock and george clooney im happy to report has made it into that pantheon you would never imagine that a film that only features two actors can be so compelling and captivating but coupled with a barrage of extraordinary digital effects co writer and director alfonso cuar oacute n has pulled it off the story begins with dr ryan stone bullock a bio medical engineer and veteran astronaut matt kowalski clooney on a spacewalk outside their space shuttle conducting routine experiments when theyre alerted by mission control in houston that a russian satellite has exploded and the debris field is headed straight for the shuttle inciting incident in a spectacular sequence the shuttle is destroyed and stone is hurled around in space still tethered to the craft bouncing on and off of it like a ping pong ball when shes finally separated from the craft kowalski utilizing his thruster pack to maneuver saves her from floating out into space and they make their way back to the space shuttle which they discover has been destroyed and the rest of the crew members dead one of the astronauts who had been outside the craft has his face blown off as we break into act ii stone and kowalski must make their way to the international space station iss if they have any chance of survival the ticking time clock so inimical to thrillers is used to great effect throughout the film kowalski sets his watch for minutes because thats when the debris field will make its first orbit around the earth and come back and possible hit them again while floating toward the iss we learn of stones back story her daughter was tragically killed in a schoolyard accident and she then decided to devote her life to her work using the thruster stone and kowalski arrive at the iss only to find the stakes are raised again as the iss crew has abandoned ship and the russian soyuz space module has been damaged useless for re entry to earth even more thrilling and shattering is that stone finds herself tangled in the already deployed parachute from the module and is holding on to kowalski whose weight is causing the parachute cords to break suffice it to say gravity avoids hollywood endings by realistically arguing that space exploration is a danger business and may result in death stone finds herself alone after kowalski cuts himself loose and we approach the dark moment of the second act as stone must maneuver the damaged module to a chinese space station tiangong but when she discovers that the module has no more fuel it appears theres no hope stones hopelessness is highlighted when she reaches a farmer on a short wave frequency who doesnt speak english the dark moment of the second act always results in the protagonist discovering a solution to the problem that happens during her hallucination that kowalski has returned to help her advising that she can still use the re entry rockets to move the craft now the protagonist must implement the solution as we head toward the climax in act iii theres more spectacular edge of your seat machinations when stone uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to get herself over and into the tiangong i wont go into the rest of it except to say that stone must not only get herself out of a real pickle during the fiery re entry to earth but must solve a new crisis after splashing down into a body of water in a remote section on earth while ive been hard on sandra bullock especially for her recent lame performance in the heat here she proves when given the right material that shes as good as any of the top stars out there today its an extraordinarily nuanced low key performance coupled with some physically demanding stunts which i suspect were not all dependent on digital effects do you hear oscar calling clooney too is masterful as he also delivers just the right kind of restrained performance to make this whole thing believable alfonso cuar oacute n has admitted that not everything we see on screen is physically or scientifically possible but so what much of the technical aspect is true to form and looks quite believable gravity is much more than a spectacular visual feast its about a struggle against overwhelming odds when bullock stone emerges from a watery tomb after going it alone a la robinson crusoe there is the sense that weve just witnessed an awe inspiring story of survival and an uplifting paean to the human spirit 
i honestly dont feel anything i could say would do this film justice it is suspenseful frightening touching and an emotional powerhouse all wrapped into minutes i really dont want to spoil the plot all you really need to know is that its about people lost in space but surviving space isnt what this movies really about its about life and it is beautiful im not a sandra bullock fan but i thought her performance here was top notch i felt attached to her character from start to finish george clooney while essentially just playing george clooney does a great job as the veteran astronaut who talks her through things but as far as acting is concerned this is bullocks movie no question about it the visuals here are just incredible not since kubricks has space seemed so beautiful yet terrifyingly deadly this movie knows how to capture the beauty and horror of the situations faced by its characters and does it with extraordinary style there are long stretches of silence emphasizing the vacuum of space as kubrick did in but often the movies best visuals are complimented by an outstanding score by composer steven price as for d this is honestly the only time ive ever felt a movie needed to be seen in d i have been against d ever since james cameron started this recent trend with avatar but im telling you now if you can see this movie in d dont miss it d feels like it actually enhances the atmosphere and emotions of this film in ways i dont think any other d film to date has as a whole im still against d films but gravity has shown me that there is a place for d movies director alfonso cuar oacute n children of men harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban has delivered a modern masterpiece it is worth seeing in theaters especially imax d as i did and i feel that when its on blu ray ill be analyzing its themes and visuals for years to come most importantly i felt genuinely moved by this motion picture the scares the tension and the emotionally charged climax it all just rang true for me as a viewer gravity will likely go down as one of s best and is a must see 
the plot is great despite the cast of one sometimes two in nearly every scene this avoids closing in on itself or turning purely psychological instead its a riveting man against nature woman actually story with murphys law doing plenty to keep it moving that alone would have made it a good movie but that ignores the cinematography words like grandeur and majesty kept running through my mind cuar oacute n took the most dramatic location ever low earth orbit and made the most of it the effects that simulated weightlessness were utterly convincing but really the visual spectacle of hard black space and the blue planet set a new standard it doesnt happen often almost never but im ready to go back and see this again and yes im sure the dvd will be great but the big screen turns this into a very different experience wiredweird
most of the negative reviews on here are not for the movie but for the way the dvd blu rays are being released i for one am more than happy with the way the re releases are being handled the original blu ray came out extremely quickly after the theatrical release in order to do that it was not d and it had no extras but whether you think that is the reason or it was to make more money is immaterial the fact of the matter is that the studio was very transparent about how they would have multiple releases of this no one was forced to buy the first one just as no one is being forced to buy this one they are simply giving the consumer more options while also maximizing their profit it is a win win if the studio were to do one grand release it would be almost a year after the theatrical release and they would have to charge more for it then people who dont want extra features would not have the option of a lower priced product they would either have to pay the high price or not get the movie at all whats more amazon is selling this for the same price as the original no frills so what are people complaining about too many options some people just want something to b tch about if you dont want it dont buy it its that simple as for the movie there are lots of reviews out there i will just say i was pleasantly surprised some of the more jaded and cynical will tell you the plot wasnt original enough what they fail to understand is that most great movies meant to appeal to a wide audience deal with universal themes and so does avatar it is the presentation of it that makes it unique if you want nuance then go watch an indie film and discuss it over a latte with your pretentious art house friends if you want a great story thats beautifully shot then watch avatar 
while its initial previews made it look likeferngullymeetsdances with wolveswith extra large smurfs in action you can rest assured that james camerons epic return to the game avatar is more than meets the eye with twelve years gone by since the directors previous record smashing film its safe to say that his absence has been felt there are very few directors who throw themselves into their work like cameron does and more often than not his films are not only hits but cinematic landmarks like his special effects break through interminator judgment dayand the massive scope and success oftitanic avatar is yet another benchmark film all the work cameron put into avatar which has been on the back burner since the mid s has no doubt paid off and if its box office receipts are any indication this is a movie that is not soon to be forgotten and is one for the ages that will be appreciated by generation after generation yeah its that good if this generation has a star wars then this my friends is it its visual effects are absolutely stunning and combined with the unique d presentation creates a world that you can truly disappear into at times you will forget you are watching a movie youll feel like youre in the jungle and youll feel like youre a part of the battle its the little the things and the attention to detail that make the film so sweet james cameron is a perfectionist and not for one moment does he let the d element of this film go to waste its less of a gimmick here and more of a device to transport you into the near perfect world he has created while the plot itself isnt ground breaking material the man vs nature thing has been done to death it is presented in a way that manages to entertain and stimulate the senses while not beating you over the head with its message it helps too that the pacing is smooth and the plot never sags at about two hours and forty five minutes long you never feel the urge to look at the time or think of anything else especially if you are seeing it in its best element an imax theater as far as the action sequences go fans who have been craving a dose of the good stuff since terminator hit theaters back in will feel more than satisfied even if the bulk of it is saved for the final act if there are any flaws to be found it is in the character department while some are well fleshed out and as three dimensional as the film itself worthington who also starred in the cameron lessterminator salvationgives a strong and sympathetic performance there are a few that seem to fall by the wayside take the characters played by joel david moore hatchet and michelle rodriguez the fast and the furious both characters fade in and out of the plot and there are moments where you arent sure where they stand i suspect this is a case of the film being edited down to fit a fair time slot although it could have been longer and not worn out its welcome and there are some character moments that will be restored in a future directors cut of the film all in all avatar is a simply awesome cinematic experience there have been few films to succeed with such broad goals and yet cameron has managed to come back after many had either written him off or assumed he was done and changed the game completely yes its hard to swallow all the hype that has accompanied this project but if ever there was a film so deserving it is this if movies are meant to take you away to a different world to escape reality for a few hours then avatar more than does its job experience it now while its still in theaters this deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible and is a film you wont want to hold out for on dvd 
one of the greatest movies ive ever seen why because this movie has everything what you need for a spectacular view actors are not superstars but its the least important aspect in movie if you have everything else in its places the acting is great special effects are superb filming and directing has nothing more to add to the story line is not new or something what you have never heard before in different interpretations what i love is that even the story is simple but the presentation and implementation of it is made the best way i could imagine james cameron is the director of this movie and what i love about him is that he has an incredible ability to make masterpieces while many other directors can just make something one of the most admirable things is that this movie avatar changed the course of movies industry james cameron showed everyone that movies can be watched in d he didnt invented d technology and i know that steve jobs didnt invented many things too what makes these men similar and what makes me admire them and their works is the ability to make great masterpieces and change the course of history i greatly recommend this movie to everyone 
avatar was beyond doubt and without a close competitor the most spectacular movie that ive seen even in flatscreen it would likely have been dazzling in d it was simply breathtaking the world pandora was like oz and wonderland and middle earth blended together but far transcended any of those other places on top of the visual feast the story was good too after the initial set up of the plot there literally was not a slow moment in the movie it was however very much a political and a religious statement in favor of green and gaian principles these were presented so compellingly however that even the strong republican evangelicals with whom i watched the movie cheered for the natives trying to save their homes from and the rouge humans who helped them in their struggle against the strip mining corporation ready to ruin a world for its natural resources aside from its politico religious aspects the story was one that edgar rice burroughs and his imitators have written over and over an outcast human finds redemption purpose and fulfillment on a hostile and hazardous alien world seldom however has the story been told better than james cameron told it and never has it been illustrated more gorgeously the next movie that i see will be avatar i hope still in d 
so where do you start reviewing avatar unless youve been living in a cave youll have heard its an extravaganza of amazing special effects that cost million youve probably heard that professional reviewers have called the storyline weak and the acting sub par i saw it last night in d which i imagine is how james cameron envisaged having it watched after the customary minute eye adjustment the effect was incredible i understand that over individual special effects were used along with the most sophisticated computer aided graphics and even newly invented hardware for example a camera where cameron could see the actors fully rendered through the lens while filming to give a real feel and real it is you come out of this movie thinking pandora is a real place and by the representation on screen cameron has been there this isnt mos eisley circa every creature here looks like it belongs on this planet itself an eye popping vision the navi dont look plastic like they appeared in early trailers they look move and act real before your eyes it sounds corny but you feel swept away into this new world almost like it was a real planet discovered the story was solid i didnt find it weak although to some it may appear simple if i had to make a negative comment it is predictable paraplegic jake sully sam worthington gets a chance to fill his recently deceased twin brothers shoes and pilot an avatar dna home grown navi human controlled under the guidance of scientist sigourney weaver and crew being a marine hes also under the scrutiny and allegiance of gung ho col quaritch excellently played by stephen lang a basic synopsis would be weaver wants to save the navi and pandora lang wants to help selfridge and co giovanni ribisi slimy as ever kill em all and mine the ore under their sacred land worthington soon realizes hes playing for the wrong team like i said its a simple plot that doesnt however make it weak people are going to talk about this movie for a long time from the sky high production costs to the box office records its sure to smash people are also talking about the movies subtext message morality is it an allegory for invading foreign lands afghanistan iraq personally i doubt it this movie has been mulling around in james camerons head since he saw george lucas make star wars in the s and has been itself over years in production the end result a detailed meticulous and believable sci fi like nothing you have seen before at mins its not short but the movie is paced very well and feels the right length the bottom line for me was an excellent unusual and thought provoking epic that will stand up for many many years if you can see it in d try to or even imax d if not just see it but make sure you do you wont forget it quickly stars 
my five star review of this movie and product just to offset the one star reviews of all the haters if you fell in love with this film in its original theatrical release then this is the best product for you if you are intrigued about an extended version of this phenomenal film then wait for that version or simply buy both i know i am going to double or even triple dip on this movie this initial release is essentially a super bit version of the first theatrical release no other version of this film on blu ray will ever be as lossless or have as much high fidelity to the original source medium the studio isnt forcing you to buy this version and they are certainly not trying to pull a fast one on you either fox and cameron have both released statements of an extended version that has been created and to be released on home video at a later date most likely early next year the extended version of the film will be making a world wide debut this summer with a run in the theaters of at least six months now think about this if a movie is going to be shown in the theaters then why would the studio supersede this event by releasing it on home video prior to it on top of the new extended version there will be a d home video release based on the new d technology a technology that none of your homes are outfitted with this new technology at its cheapest quality will still cost the average consumer or more this is not the old school d tech that incorporates red pink and blue green cardboard glasses just to give you a heads up even the new glasses will cost you an average of a piece even most brand new blu ray players sold today wont be able to support this new d tech and add the price of the new d hd televisions you will end up paying or more on a system to handle this new tech in all that it can offer just google reald or tru d to find out more about this new stereoscopic technology some might claim that they already own blu ray that are in d but they are mistaken if they think this is the same tech that avatar will be using right now there isnt a single home video for sale that utilizes this new tech sure i want the to date unseen extended version but it wont be anywhere near the visual and audio quality of this version just speculation here i would think that the extended version would have to be placed on a dual layer double sided blu ray with only one half the film on either side if this is not done then there surely would be a loss of information as the movie would have to be highly compressed if you avoid this release i can guarantee you will be missing out on the best transfer this film will ever have on blu ray 
in march pink floyd released dark side of the moon the retail shops soon found that this album was to be the bench mark used to judge the quality of the new stereos that were making the market if dark side sounded good the stereo was good and so to avatar this film will be the benchmark for many things testing ones home theater mines a panosonic out for the myriad of sounds from various creatures machines and other noise making events as they jump around the various speakers and hit you from all directions or perhaps to showcase your plasma screen tv such as i have sony wega at its ultimate best or even that blue ray player making it all happen mines a panosonic digital twin tuner whatever your set up is this movie will make your system s give up their absolute best and leave you wondering if what you have is an awesome set up or maybe time for an upgrade to the movie itself well i ignored the pre release blurb hype i wanted to judge it for myself i loved the abyss and i loathed titanic i found myself watching a cross bewteen an action story a love story a conservation story and even a dry humour story i dont know what cameron had to do to satisfy the purists whom seem less than enamored by this film but for me the minutes took me to a place where i want to go even if it is dangerous it took me away from the real world isnt this what cinema is all about to tell a story and science fiction can take you to places that may exist as but far as we know it is currently only in ones imagination i really dont know where the time went there were no slack bits the romance delicately handled the action at times ruthless and the conservation theme very much there i felt the actors gave it an awesome effort and that camerons direction ensured that the amazing effects did not over shadow the actors in the fore i mean theres plenty going on in the background yet the fore ground still keeps your attention being on blue ray i was also able to pause get up and have a look at something in the background and be amnazed at the indepth details the musical score was consistant and a pleasure that helped enhance rather than distract the total package is well wrapt together weta workshops did themselves proud and as a new zealander i am very proud of their work done in studios not miles from my residence i dont know anyone whom worked on this film but i wish i did i shall have to remain a proud new zealander and dream of one day visiting pandora well in the cinema or in my man cave with my home entertainment center at most i look forward to the possible disc release in november and its a long time before we get d tvs etc here in nz and at a realistic price 
of course this is old news by now however i thoroughly enjoyed this fast paced movie a lot of action and adventure along with spectacular special effects we are transported to a magical place that we do not want to see destroyed our planet is magical also and we should not let it be destroyed either point well taken 
this was an incredible movie experience im a big james cameron fan but i never thought id see him top titanic but this movie did in alot of ways the special effects are incredible the plot was great i love a movie that pulls u in emotionally the way it did the creature designs were well designed the acting was great this is certainly a movie not to be missed i also highly recommend the blu ray version your cutting yourself short if u dont this is the best blu ray ive seen the colors are deep with depth and truly amazing to watch avatar showcases what blu ray is all about highly recommended 
 minutes into this movie i was hooked amazing special effects avatar is a perfect almost hours of complete escape from reality plot line is a bit predictable some of characters are stereotypes but just sit back enjoy 
i do not have a d television but i did not see avatar in d in the theater my son has a huge television screen and had not seen the film we watched only an hour of it because of committments that day and my granddaughter was mesmerized he has a great sound system and the blu ray sound was awesome when i left he asked will you leave avatar here it is so awesome i want to see it all nuff said anything that can engage a thirty two year old engineer and a two year old girl is worth it i thought it was great for the money and available technology 
all d movies pale in comparison story line alternate world creation cgi flawless even after seeing more than once you still grab the arms of the chair in excitement and suspense i am waiting for someone to come close 
if avatar didnt live up to the hype id want my and a half hours back haha a visually impressive presentation with an adventurous and intriguing storyline just about sums up avatar its a notch better than say jurassic park for instance sure avatar isnt focused around dinosaurs but it does implement the adventurous aspect a tad better in my opinion no boredom anywhere in avatar and a much much much heavier attention to action and adventure that makes it better than jurassic park avatar is just a wonderful film with only a little bit of coarse language so its basically appropriate for any age they do say the sh word occasionally though so be alert for that when watching the film with the youngsters 
this is about the original movie and dvd only not the disc version being released tomorrow im biased because i loved avatar and saw it five times in the theaters the d was excellent and enjoyable by far the complaint was that the special effects were incredible but the plot was boring and unoriginal the fx are of course amazing but i liked the story as well romeo and juliet set in outer space also mr cameron deserves a little more credit here than what hes been getting this is an incomplete list and itd take someone better informed than me to complete it but here are some of the influences that i spotted sir james frazier joseph campbell edgar rice burroughs frank frazetta the bible love those christ figures the aforementioned shakespeare joseph conrad the ramayana plains indians amazon rain forest indians gaia t h lawrence the masai vietnam the middle east and thats all i can think of right now my point is that more thought went into the script than people seem to realize it is of course very derivative but there arent too many totally unique plots out there show me a few please at least mr cameron used high quality sources for his concept another complaint was mr camerons politics im not a liberal or a leftist and i wasnt inconvenienced by any attempts to brainwash me into anti american anti military anti consumerism anti business anti capitalism anti imperialism or anti anything viewpoints i just appreciated the movie and enjoyed the ride i figured that mr cameron needed despicable villains and henchmen as well as noble heroes and heroines which is what any epic requires because the main evil doer and his mercenaries and the corporate execs were american some people got very offended i just looked at them as handy all purpose scoundrels not as representatives of something i was supposed to hate forevermore dont forget the hero and christ figure was an ex marine didnt that balance things out for you i dont know or care about james camerons personal philosophies i just believe he intended to create an entertaining enjoyable enthralling movie and that he succeeded admirably anybody who only sees art produced by people who share the same outlook is missing out on a lot of what the world has to offer you dont have to be converted in order to appreciate someone elses vision there has to be a final note about the incredible fx the visuals were undeniably spectacular and even people who hated the movie itself all agreed on that a lot of diligence and work and thought and effort went into avatar and it clearly shows mr cameron and his actors and crew and staff were obviously deeply committed to their vision and it showed in every scene my only complaint was the soundtrack a flick like this deserved a score on the same level as the good the bad and the ugly or once upon a time in the west or the last of the mohicans or the magnificent seven it was after all an exciting cowboy movie placed in outer space it richly deserved a stirring and emotional soundtrack but instead there was mostly innocuous elevator music throughout i love leona lewis but putting her song over the end credits wasted it imho it wouldve fit in better during the movie itself also imho anyway i highly recommend avatar hard to imagine a more enjoyable film 
while the storyline is somewhat familiar it was done in a spectacular style that was colorful and fast moving on the moon pandora the earth military has invaded seeking an element they find there a young marine crippled in an accident finds that the death of his brother has given him a pass to this strange planet to take part in a program his brother had been involved in prior to his death the avatar being he assumes has given him the ability to leave his wheelchair but because he is on active duty he finds himself embroiled in a plot to infiltrate the home of the people on this moon called the naavi to learn about them in order to find their weaknesses because the element the company is seeking is directly under their encampment on his first foray out he gets lost and is saved by natira who was intending to kill him until an omen stops her and she brings him to her people he does learn and finds out what his own people are planning to do it is then that he chooses sides although he finds himself frustrated until he finally realizes he must become a legendary being by conquering a creature known as last shadow and rallying the tribes and the entire moon to fight a terrible battle against his own people who are determined to kill them anyway they can 
husband states it was better than star trek he is a star trek star wars fanatic but says this one beats them all 
 avatar on blu ray is absolutely amazing the picture is truly incredible this movie is quite an experience the first time you see it i own alot of blu rays nothing comes close to this picture quality after seeing the movie in d in the theater i knew the blu ray dvd version would be great i was also happy with the fact that although this version doesnt have all the bells and whistles extra footage special features and trailers that the extended dvd versions due out later this year will have the blu ray does come with a regular dvd which has been great for me because ive been able to lend it out to my friends so they can enjoy it along with their families personally i would not have wanted to wait until the end of the year to see avatar again this is the highest grossing movie ever a worldwide phenomenon if it turns out that the extended blu ray dvd is that much more amazing then this version ill buy it again if you havent seen this unbelievable epic movie do yourself a favor and watch it on blu ray asap by the looks of reading the other reviews here seems that some older blu ray player models cannot play avatar without a firmware update i do find that pretty ridiculous not that the dvd requires an update of the blu ray player itself but that they dont give consumers buying this at the store a fair warning i would be extremely upset if i purchased avatar only to find out that i couldnt play it this is noted at the top of amazons page however good on them for that my player is around six months old and had no issues playing the dvd if your unsure you may want to rent it first on blu ray avatar is the future of movies and im looking forward to more enjoy 
product arrived as ordered and in shape described i thought this movie was all hype when it first came out wow was i wrong this movie is so topical and accurate politics wise that it can be viewed years and decades from now and it will still be true the scenes are spectacular and imaginative 
hello to everyone who reads this i have bought from amazon over blu ray titles by now and this would be my first ever review on a blu ray title if i am not mistaken i think i did one review on short circuit not sure i still didnt get my avatar blu ray from amazon as at the time i am writing this it is pm on pst i should receive my copy of avatar blu ray tomorrow which is on its official schedule release on earths day yet i received a copy of it on blu ray yesterday from another very well known source to me which i cant mention here due to legal street issues date firstly i have to let you all know that my friends tv is calibrated and this review is mainly based from what i see on my friends calibrated tv settings in other words if your tv is not yet been calibrated please dont blame my review after watching avatar on your none calibrated tv let me start with just saying this unbelievable quality i have no idea how mr cameron did it this is the best ever blu ray title that i have ever witness just amazing and mind blowing waiting on star wars blu ray set and hoping it will have the same quality knowing mr g lucas it took my breath away i think i disturb my friend gary many times while watching the movie by parsing the quality of it mainly i take my hat off to mr cameron for giving the viewers of avatar experience by taking off all that hollywood crap out from the menu which they usually adds and cheers again for that mr cameron cheers a lot for having respect for viewers cheers again for giving us a such a nice treat we appreciate your art with great respect my ratings on video quality i gave it a five stars audio quality i gave it a five stars overall blu ray quality i gave it a five stars overall for the movie avatar five stars and two thumbs up i do also know that the release on nd of avatar will not have the extra forty five minutes but mr cameron were nice enough to let us know way ahead about it so we can make our choice of which version to by such as april nd release or the late november avatar directors cut release therefore we will not have to double dip it not many in hollywood movie industry does give that early information of a late directors cut release before they release their very first title release they always grab our money by releasing a late directors cut with a surprise also i will not forget to thank the fox studio for releasing the blu ray for where they would have unarguably sold it for very easily over which is considering with the cost of the movie even though they covered in two weeks of the opening well as thinking of other prices of some not so good new releases my hats off to you on that fox studio still there is one thing that bugs me and i am sad or rather upset about what fox studio did which is stated here by me this is only my opinion and does not say i am right here but its a strong opinion we here in usa produce all the blockbusters and still england and europe gets the best deal and pricing why i dont know it is a million dollar question for me example avatar in england gets a choice to buy the blu ray dvd combo pack with a steel book and other survival guide book of avatar for british pounds which is at todays currency exchange rate or else they can buy just the blu ray at a cheaper price it might be expensive for most of us yet the choice would have been give to us in the usa market too and most of other titles that are released in england and europe they always gets a very good buying options well as good pricing too mainly amazon uk then again this is only my opinion like i have mentioned above what i am trying to say here is we the usa make these films and such choice should have been given to us in usa too in definitely i have pre ordered the usa and the uk version of it the uk version was ordered because i wanted the steel book edition but if the choice was given to the usa market i would have saved the that i have spend on the uk steel book edition as it would helped me on the long run as i am going to buy the avatar november directors cut release too there after if they release a d version i will not buy it because the movie was not shot on d camera but still it would have help me if we in usa had the choice overall my european version of avatar blu ray will not go a waist as i will keep the steel book and give the blu ray to my nephew who lives in spain for those who are waiting for a good d movie in mr michael bays transformer is the best why he is shooting it in the real way how it is meant to be shot with d and d dual lens anamorphic camera just a tip for fans overall my anonymous respect goes to mr cameron for taking us into a such a wonderful unforgettable excursion in life million thanks to you again and cheers to fox studio for keeping the price at for blu ray and dvd combo pack at amazon and thanks for the great production crew of this movie avatar well as let us not forget to thank the geeks who work in it too without them there wouldnt be a avatar movie cheers to all of you i will not have to write in here asking people to buy it within another week time if you read i am very sure this will be the avatar most sold blu ray title in currant blu ray history enjoy your avatar copy please if you can try and calibrate your tv before you watch it calibrate your sound system and watch it on dts hd uncompressed sound those who doesnt have blu ray system and p tv with their own good reasons whenever time permits you please buy it as this is how movies are meant to be watch i thank you all a lot for reading my review on avatar blu ray take care may peace prevail on earth please plant a tree whenever you can and dont destroy any that you have love brazil d uluwita long beach ca 
although avatar was a great movie in its own right it was also a message for our own lives on this planet it brought to life the complexity of our lives and how we are so closely relying on our planet as well as each other for our survival as a species what a message in a brillant movie done with innovative style loved it 
if you arent familiar with avatar its time you were it is hands down the best effects movie ever made there isnt anything even close when we saw it in the theater we felt that it was an experience comparable to the first time we saw star wars in star wars moved effects movies to a new level of experience and avatar has done the same thing years later the only other movies i would suggest that fit in the category are jurassic park and much later the lord of the rings trilogy integrated computer animation had of course been done before notably in jumanhi but i felt that jurassic park was the first movie in which it looked real lord of the rings went a step further by mass producing the animated actors and put them in very close proximity to the live actors avatars leap was to make an almost entirely animated film look real this blu ray set is an outstanding viewing experience the color and detail is a cut above even other blu ray movies we own i feel that the sharpness of the blu ray was better than the theater even the imax viewing we attended it doesnt have d but i didnt really miss that aspect of the experience im sure that someday well purchase d viewing equipment but were not doing so yet and im happy to enjoy the movie in this form until the time we do the extra scenes just add to the experience they are mostly jungle scenes often with animals that you did not see in the original theatrical release the quality is up to the standards of the shots in the original release so they are seamless and just add to the already immersive atmosphere of this film the surround sound is encompassing without being overbearing perfect for home theater viewing i know the movies detractors whine about the story ive never been able to figure out what their problem is the story is involving and dramatic does it remind you of parts of other movies youve seen over the years sure but so what what movie doesnt in every case it takes any similar plot well beyond what you may be reminded of and most importantly this plot is a good vehicle for the effects which are the stand out achievement of this film in the first place considering that as a fan of this movie you are going to watch this again and again the blu ray set is an incredible entertainment bargain at this price if by some chance you have not seen this movie yet youre in for a real treat when you view this blu ray offering edit we now also have the d version of this movie which we viewed with a sony d blu ray and a lg passive d wide screen lcd four of us viewed it and thought that it looked better than when we originally saw in in the theater in imax d the image had both tremendous depth and external room penetration the little floating animals plants appeared to be halfway between me and the screen surface virtually the entire time it looked like we could step through the screen into that world one of our friends expressed the opinion that he thought the colors were more rich than in the theater or on the previous d blu ray its a must have for anyone with d home theater 
i couldnt help but scan the bad reviews you know what the majority of them are bad reviews on the edition not the movie in fact these very same reviews will probably carry over to the other editions coming out thus needlessly lowering the ranking for an absolutely fabulous movie having watched it in d i was floored and loved the movie a left the theater feeling that i had just watched one of the best movies of my life so far and that is not easy to do the special effects were amazing despite what some haters out there are saying that the graphics are cheesy cmon hate the storyline but you can in no way say that the graphics are cheesy and i enjoyed the storyline and plot the combination of action drama love sci fi and so on everything nowadays has been done in one way shape or form so it matters in how it is delivered that will make something stand out and stand out avatar does and then some while i thought the theater version was absolutely fantastic i couldnt help but enjoy watching on my inch hd tv in blu ray enjoying the colors and graphics even more in depth than if i were at the theater if you can hold off and dont mind spending the extra money than wait for the special editions coming out which i agree is pretty lame why not release the extras with this release if not to make more money later on i was a little let down when i went for the extras and there werent any but if youre like me and you wanted to watch it now and you dont want to spend the extra money than run out and get this blu ray i was just as floored my second time around at home as i was the first time around in d at the theaters a definite recommend stars 
in the genres of action and sci fi films this is the very best film that i have seen in my years of life it is truly spectacular the detail is incredible the computer generated material is seamless the story is interesting and the action is really excellent even the military stuff is remarkably well done the scope imagination and spectacle is unequalled in film to date i never thought that i would ever say that a film blew away lotr but avatar did look at the stats billion dollars worth of viewers cant be wrong this film doubled the grossing film of all time lotr it has almost equalled the revenue of all three lord of the rings films combined and of course it has eclipsed the former film titanic both domestically and internationally and it is still in many theatres i dont care if they create a dozen versions of the dvd this film is so special that the pain of buying the dvd is soon forgotten when one sits down and watches this amazing motion picture the studio is entitled to its profits they gave us top quality entertainment my bree
best picture and one of the best movies in history whether the academy likes it or not the ceremony of the oscars was obviously partialized to give the awards to the hurt locker which is an excellent movie great directing but totally forgettable when i saw it i found it to be a good war related movie the end was shockingly empty and depressive i got the message but that was it i left the theater and days later was it totally forgotten why because acting and directing well is not enough to make a good epic movie there were some holes that needed to be covered see my comments for the hurt locker i can not say the same thing about avatar i saw this movie last year and i still have it in my mind pounding in my heart and for the millions of people who have carefully watched understood and appreciated avatar i can assure that they will have it in their minds and hearts not just because of the navis pandora creatures the outrageous cinematography or the outstanding visual effects technology used they will have avatar dearly close to them because of the message is sending to the world were killing our planet and all that lives in it including ourselves we invent and make wars to own what is not ours no matter what the global warming is a fact now and a big problem for the human kind people is dying every day because of its consequences and nobody cares because of ignorance greed or pure evil it is our turn now to take action to stop this massacre that our governments or industrial s pursue in order to take own control and steal from others their goods some say that avatar was full of clich eacute s a clich eacute is a convenient word used to diminish an action that supposedly has been used too frequently that eventually loses its meaning well it is the life of our planet we are talking about here and there will never be enough clich eacute s to call the attention to this matter pandora was used as a representation of our planet in they way it was intended to be rich for all of us to share peaceful and spiritually pleasant but pandora was destroyed the same way we do in real life just next to my door i can see devastation and nobody cares when a truth is slapped in your face some people use very conveniently the word clich eacute the academy tried to diminish avatar success by ignoring it in the oscars well despite the obvious hilarious and ridiculous attitude of the academy past sunday i have to say that see if james cameron cares hes has done his part already and hes got the big billions in his bank and not the ones that were awarded james cameron the academy needed for personal political social reasons to give the awards to a woman period someone that has not been awarded period some even said that it was something you said in the ceremony well whatever excuse ive heard or read in the news just dont mind them and keep the good work because youre excellent and perfect in what you do and you do it flawlessly 
this is a movie my husband and i both adore so much truth in it even though its kind of sci fi it was a must have in our video library 
like other reviewers i am upset to learn that none of us have the final final complete film in our possession that like kingdom of heaven there is a longer and more complete version of this film on the near horizon from some reviewers i gather this later edition is better whatever is going to happen i am going to only comment on what i saw last night for the first time and then rewatched today in one word wow i have seen where fx is going what a jump for this film goer who loved kingdom of heaven director ridley scotts alien and camerons own sequel to that sci fi classic some say that sequel was better than the original my biggest complaint about modern movies is story given up for fx there are too many films out there the last many years in which that is happening but not here and i hope the story line will be intact in the upcoming dvd release of benecio del toros take on the wolfman another film with as the teasers show incredible fx but also two academy award winning actors in del toro and hopkins but back to avatar a wonderful story wonderful wonderful wonderful sure i know its been told alot of times but it was told very well here very believably well and the fx only added to the magic of the sci fi saga they did not become the reason for the film in my opinion so even if there is a longer and better version of avatar on the horizon dont wait buy this and enjoy the film the acting done a great deal by things that dont really exist and get your head around that concept is excellent the music uplifting and the scenes are breathtaking every single shot of this film is breathtaking from a gritty cremation to free falling down a cliff miles deep into a bottomless valley why wait a longer and frankly better version of kingdom of heaven did not make me wait when that dvd first came out im glad i did not wait here you will too i suspect its a treat avatar does what films are supposd to do and does it well longer version or not it entertains you will be entertained if this isnt enough to satisfy film goers out there they are too jaded and should worry 
takes you away to another world where the hero fights to do the right thing a story that has been told before but in such a beautiful way and with wonderful environmental messages for young and old a movie you can watch over and over and enjoy it more each time a great friday night popcorn and family video 
the parallels between the storyline in this movie and the destruction of the native american tribes in us history is striking like the navi most native american tribes had belief systems which described a living energy in all things plants animals an energy that is shared between the people the land the animals and the plants the entire ecosystem the only difference in this movie is that unlike the civil ization of native tribes in the history marginalized to oblivion the natives in this movie rise up for the rights of all this movie reconciles the consciousness of america to our own powerful religion that all men are created equal a phrase written when one man could own another as property it was a phrase we still struggle to live up too and this movie gives a cathartic sense either that the past can be righted or at the very least if we had it all to do again stronger hearts would prevail we would chose to act on our powerful principles and give rights to all ideas and all peoples the real power in this movie is its depiction of universal truths 
we really enjoy our dvd edition of avatar the grandkids enjoy it and we like to watch it when theres nothing on tv worth watching t his is a great escapist adventure with dynamic colors and a wonderful storyline saldana weaver worthington do a fantastic job of acting the special effects are phenominal 
i don t know how hurt locker won best picture over avatar four stars thumbs up who cares about special effects the movie is spectacular enough people today are spoiled most deleted scenes are deleted for a reason mostly they are boring do not fit right in the movie this is one of the best movies in my collection if you went to see it in the theaters you would get no special effects get over it i didn t see it in d and really don t care if i ever do a movie as good as this doesn t really need to be d 
avatar is a spectacular film the way its directed written and cast is phenomenal many are very annoyed that it came out without and bonus material but its alright i would suggest ordering this one so you have the original version the version that is due to come out later this year is going to be extended with new footage and extra material i purchased this set and i am planning to buy the new one as well when james camerons titanic was released on dvd it too came out with just the film but then came out again with a new edition that had extended scenes and even new one there were still even deleted scenes after the extension i still must say that you need you get this version this version is now a limited time offer plus if cameron releases avatar like he did with titanic it could get pricy titanic came out in a set when it was rereleased so you may not even have the money to get it thats why i suggest getting this one now just in case thanks for reading please dont post rude comments because this is my opinion except it really is just a limited time only so buy soon 
for its not a bad price for two dvds even without the special features you got one heck of a deal its beats not spending or more on the same dvd combo if you were to buy it from walmart target or best buy for amazon thats not a bad price 
this is absolutely the best movie i have every seen in my years the best 
i received this yesterday on blu ray and was very impresssed for what i paid with free shipping it was an amazing deal the extended edition is awesome you get to see a lot more of pandora and get better explanations and back stories of alot of things i like most of the population dont have a d tv so d movies arent really of interest to me i am not at all upset with this release the packaging is very cool everything is just perfect havent looked into the special features just yet but they look promising overall i would definitely recommend this release even if you already bought the bare bones release i did and i am very happy i upgraded picture quality is outstanding but i would expect nothing less from this movie 
i saw the movie in the theater in d i liked the movie in the theater in d but all i wanted was a basic dvd of the movie with no frilly froo froo extras that i could play on my home theater system this is your basic avatar no d no frills no games no directors cut no making avatar documentary no interviews with the director or stars nothing extra just the basic avatar movie i like my basic avatar movie and i recommend it to anyone who just wants to see the movie without all the frilly froo froo stuff that too many people think you have to have when you buy a dvd these days 
i wont miss the special features and the original theatrical version was fantastic i dont really like watching how they stood in front of green screen while cgi was added later anyway i prefer just to watch the movie no frills if a special edition does come out that is the one ill rent as for d well cross that bridge when we come to it i will buy this on earth day stars all the way 
you would think that the man who redefined science fiction and action films over the past quarter century terminator true lies and culminated with the best hat trick in movie history with titanic garnering superlative reviews earning the all time box office and winning a record oscars would be satisfied and perhaps go on cruise control with a smaller film but no cameron aims higher with a thrilling adventure that combines game changing special effects that have to be seen on the big screen in d in the not too distant future jake sully sam worthington a physically challenged soldier volunteers for an unusual mission on a far away planet pandora a beautiful yet dangerous world where the blue skinned navi are a primitive enlightened race who are at one with nature and its balance of life as epitomized by the tree of souls a kind of fiber optic tree that has a consciousness utilizing a unique technology that enables sully to become sentient in a genetically engineered substitute navi body or avatar he is deposited on pandora to assimilate himself into their culture led by a stern no nonsense scientist dr grace augustine sigourney weaver jake learns the ways of the navi people especially through neytiri zoe saldana a proud warrior much like the heroine in heavy metal whose father is the tribal leader you just know that jake and neytiri are going to become closer in their relationship sullys commanding officer col miles quaritch stephen lang expects him to gather intelligence on the navi defense and capabilities in an effort to secure the valuable minerals beneath the navi settlement it seems that a mining company wants the minerals at any cost as sully bonds with these people and realizes that what the military plans to do he has a change of heart and rallies all the villages to band together for a last stand and a simple battle between good and evil ensues with the navi hopelessly outgunned and overly matched the story is simple with political overtones about preserving a green planet and the clash between science and the military this military is an extension of the bad asses in camerons aliens there are obvious parallels to the iraq war with its natural oil resource you can see elements of the matrix with its out of body experience and star wars return of the jedi with its david versus goliath setup any fan of old tarzan films knows how nature is harnessed by the hero you get the feeling that this planets life force is a collective much as the trees in the lord of the rings trilogy and that something extraordinary might happen the avatar plot device bares loose similarities to the s tv show outer limits episode chameleon while jake has damaged legs he is able to revel in his new body and experiences what amounts to a rebirth his initiation into navi life is not dissimilar to the initiation rites in dances with wolves apparently cameron has been gestating this idea for many years waiting for movie technology to catch up to his complicated visuals it was worth the wait he has always been at the forefront of state of the art effects the abyss terminator so it comes as no surprise that he has single handedly elevated the creative possibilities of d presentation to the mainstream cameron does not resort to using d as a gimmick by simply throwing objects at the screen but rather organically and even shots of the planets jungles are fully realized settings with plant life and insects that jump out of the screen the motion capture compliments and reflects real acting what is remarkable is that this film is simultaneously demonstrating multiple visual effects in a seamlessly integrated presentation courtesy of camerons fertile imagination production values dont get any better james horner composes an energetic yet tender score that evokes his own titanic and glory although the second half settles into a more conventional war film thats a minor complaint there is a reference to jakes late brother a subplot that does not add much to the story who was originally slated for the mission worthington and saldana star trek in expressive motion capture do a very solid job of emoting real feelings and making their love a tangible believable union lang has an intimidating presence as the military commander and its nice to see his career resurgence public enemies weaver lends strong support as the wise impassioned scientist who will defend the navis even with her life make no mistake this is a groundbreaking film in terms of technical achievement and theatrical presentation it needs to be experienced in d to get the complete experience do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this landmark film 
loved the movie the picture quality is amazeing best looking blu ray ive seen this is the movie you bust out to show off your tv to your friends and family movie was awesome as well 
i really dont care about minutes of outtakes and special features and interviews with the cast and all the other stuff for twenty bucks and get both blu and regular dvd its a bargain on an awesome film this is spectacular special effects and the movie is all i want get this and you will be happy 
i did not see avatar in the theaters and waited for the blu ray release this is my usual pattern having been a science fiction fan for over years i was curious to see what this movie would bring to the genre frequently movies that are hyped to the extent this one has been hyped can be to some degree disappointing when viewed this one was consistent in that regard but to a lesser degree than i had feared having never seen it in d i can nevertheless see how it was produced to serve the features that d offers many scenes present objects that move toward the viewer in a manner designed to provoke a reaction from the d viewer this does not in my opinion interfere with the enjoyment of the movie in d my overall reaction to the movie is favorable in many regards first is the interesting idea of the avatar this idea has surfaced in sci fi but not often in my experience the second is the idea of the sentient planet which has been used much more often this version minimizes the proactive nature of that sentience by comparison with other sci fi stories thirdly the picture quality and audio quality are both outstanding as are the much touted special visual effects if i were to identify some flaws i would have to mention the rather prosaic stereotypical characters that occupy certain supporting roles in the movie the short sighted narrowly focused corporate manager character has been done far too often sigourney weavers character in alien had a corporate antagonist cut out of exactly the same cloth the tough driven mercenary commanders character has also been used to the point of annoyance they were some of the evil straw men set up for the audience to hate the tough mercenary soldiers were similarly designed to generate audience revulsion devices such as these are manipulative and i would have hoped this movie would rise above such simplistic alternatives i would say that such choices as were made in this regard can be understood and overlooked if one can accept the basic premises of the movie in general some of the battle scenes were reminiscent of star wars but were suitably bombastic it may be a propaganda piece as some have pointed out but that is fairly easy to overlook i have watched the movie twice now and actually enjoyed it more the second time a lot is happening fast and i would say it will take two viewings at least to begin to absorb all that is being displayed on the screen the scenery is fascinating in its detail and provides the viewer with many interesting backgrounds it is evident that a huge amount of work went into creating the movie and the planet pandora it appears that many who bought the disc have had problems viewing the movie blu ray is a technological marvel but it does require some tender loving care most importantly blu ray machines can and should be updated with the latest software in this regard blu ray players are more like computers than the dvd players of the past i have two oppo players which are both capable of playing the disc they are both connected by an ethernet connection to the web and inform me automatically when an update is available i would strongly suggest that all of those who are having problems avail themselves of any updates that might be available from the manufacturers of their equipment updates can usually be made from a network connection through a usb input or from a disc for those who are disinterested in technology it may be wise to have a knowledgeable friend help with setup or hire someone to do the necessary setup this is a problem that wont go away if ignored if on the other hand the manufacturer is not providing the needed updates or the player is obsolete and cannot update then that is another problem entirely if you find yourself deciding to get a new blu ray player may i suggest the oppo bdp i am looking at one as i type this and can recommend it highly it is available from amazon and will play avatar by way of summary this is a disc worth having some have complained it does not have extras and that is true but for one can enjoy the movie now at home and then should one desire treat ones self to a christmas present when the ultimate edition comes out 
ive only watched the blu ray version twice but it is really incredible i have never seen any hd to compare with this one the movie itself is a work of art with an incredible level of creativity and beautiful design ornamentation to stretch anyones imagination the d effect through parallax humans perceive d by both binocular vision for near objects and parallax for more distant objects is the best i have seen the theme is also highly relevant to our times the expressivity of the actors is beyond comparison certainly real and enhanced by the technology used to produce this i really look forward to an expanded version of this blu ray in the future if one is forthcoming i have heard a popular story line related to the lack of an original story or character development in this and it is just gibberish i can see how the film would be viewed as a threat to traditional hollywood filmmaking however i have seen hurt locker that won the academy award for best picture and it is a good film the single theme and unidimensional character of that movie was simply this obsession with dangerous work in contrast avatar has a great deal to say about native cultures that are close to nature e g stone age cultures in general exploitation of resources by technology driven societies and the mystery of life itself it will make you think about the mystery of incarnation this is a deeply thoughtful production a fact that should not be missed as you follow the carefully written action adventure story line the theme and the artwork bear a signature that is unique in the history of filmmaking also if you dont already have a blu ray dvd upconvert player this is the best reason to get one now 
i wasnt too sure about this one but was really awed by it fantastic movie enjoyed it tremendously great animatronics will watch it again again 
the first thing i notice is the extreme packaging a slip off sleeve then a box cover containing a book with three really fancy pages with a pull out disc holder all with very nice depiction of avatar scenes over every visible inch of the packaging all this hints that something special lies inside and you wont be disappointed at least i wasnt and it was well worth the price disc avatardisc menu play setup sound search extrasthis disc contains three versions of avater original movie release special edition dvd re release with additional minutes and collectors extended cut with additional minutes if you saw the movie then youve seen version if you bought the dvd then youve seen version what you want to see now is version the collectors extended cut with additional minutes if you just click on the play menu choice youll get version to play version or click first on setup film selection then choose the special addition re release or the collectors extended cut the collectors extended cut contains all the scenes in versions and plus the additional scenes so no need to view versions or even if you havent seen the movie yet under the sound menu is an option to have all the swear words deleted from the sound track but it doesnt work for version collectors extended cut which is the version you want to watch and the swearing is very light no f words under extras menu are all the added scenes which is handy of you fall asleep watching the extended cut movie as i did and want to see if you missed anything new disc filmakers journeydisc menu deleted scenes capturing avatar a message from pandora production materialthe best thing about disc are the more than minutes of deleted scenes there are many of them all in various stages of completion and all but two add considerably to understanding the story line especially dream hunt and challenge the two deleted scenes that should stay deleted are norm is a god and norms attitude improves the deleted scenes are the next place to go after viewing the extended collectors cut on disc capturing avatar is about how the film married real human facial expression and human movement to the animated avatar scenes it is very interesting to see a message form pandora is about james cameron going down to the amazon basin in brazil and joining the jungle tribes fighting against the construction of a dam if there was any doubt that cameron was anything other than a dedicated tree hugging environmentalist this will dispel all doubts disc pandoras boxthis disc primarily has items a filmmaker might be interested in the bd live portal is also on disc which allows you to download additional material i tried this but found nothing new that wasnt already on one of the three discs and also the download was very slow my take on this edition of avatari am a civil engineer who thinks bulldozers and mining equipment are righteous and good i suppose in an environmentalists eyes i have done my share of raping the environment although the way i see it natural resources are there to be utilized i do believe however that the resources need to be used wisely and efficiently and that renewable resources should be harvested by sustainable methods and the earth returned to a green state after opening it and harvesting whatever is there i present the above because it is very clear that avatar is permeated with tree hugging environmentalist propaganda and cameron so much as admits it in a message from pandora on disc nevertheless cameron made a really terrific movie promoting environmentalist concerns though probably his message is totally lost on sinners like myself still i very much like this movie and especially the collectors cut because it is so realistically done because it is an exciting adventure story with lots of very dangerous creatures because it is also a love story and because it is a hero story the little guy fighting the faceless bureaucracy of a large corporation or government as someone who has thrice married into different cultures in different countries and experienced the somewhat difficult task of adjusting to and accommodating a foreign culture i think cameron has done a good job presenting the difficulty and opposition that naturally occurs against inter cultural romance and much more so for inter specie romance even if it is through a remotely controlled avatar body much of this opposition was deleted in the original movie but is evident in the added scenes and especially the deleted scenes summarythe extra scenes in the collectors extended cut disc and the deleted scenes disc by themselves make this set well worth the price and a story worth watching over and over all the while hoping for a sequel if you are also into how movies are made there are plenty of ground breaking techniques presented on discs and the sequelmy idea of what would be an interesting sequel jake and neytiri have a baby or two jake leads the navi to develop some technology to prepare for the return of the earthers but find the navi uninterested jake remembers how european settlers arrived in america in such overwhelming numbers that the natives were completed subjugated and near annihilated he fears that unless the navi modernize to some degree at least the military the same will happen to the navi when the earthers eventually return for revenge jake goes to the tree of souls and discovers grace has merged with eywa and can communicate with jake jake and grace discover they can reach each other telepathically grace eywa has some ability to sense events beyond the planet moons surface grace and jake begin to develop their telepathic powers and discover thay also have some telekinetic powersby the time the earthers return jake and grace can affect the control mechanisms on the earthers ships take it from there cameron 
first off ill address the people complaining about the absence of a d version panasonic currently has an exclusive right to the d version of avatar till february cameron has stated that the standalone d release is still one to two years out the market simply isnt saturated enough with dtvs to justify at this time and from a business standpoint this is actually smart early adopters of d technology shouldnt be surprised here its nothing new to the electronics industry in time it will happen that goes for other films as well the film is once again presented in its natively shot ratio cameron has admitted to falling in love with the version and stated that he does not ever plan to release the crop of it for home release why anyone want to chop off the original frame on the top and bottom then blow it up is beyond me i see a lot a comments about this and wanted to help clear that up as well this movie has been cited as revolutionary to cinema for its technical breakthroughs some criticism has been placed on its story seeming too familiar but i think that is kinda what made it work the new technology had a good old fashioned story arc to carry it while at the same time giving us an entirely new universe and setting and being one that could be accepted cross culturally this film broke box office records in just about every country in the world it was a gamble that paid off its now the top selling blu ray of all time as well so obviously the d was a bonus yet not so much a requirement to enjoy it its a great science fiction film with traditional elements to drive it exploration a love story and camerons trademark action sequence directing the third act really shines in the aspect of the latter that is my opinion for what its worth nothing more nothing less this release gives you the film as originally cut and by utilizing seamless branching you can watch two more extended versions of it after watching it now i feel the extended version gives the viewer much more background on jakes story arc the conflict between the navi and the humans and the character of grace as well i was very impressed with it the blu ray video and audio transfer still shines as reference quality basically this is the movie where you can really push the potential of your home theater clean no artifacts and very sharp the added scenes also look clean and just as crisp as the original scenes weta really did a great job on them considering they were just for a limited special edition theatrical release audio is prefect excellent dts hd master audio and it could pass for the original studio master clean clear and powerful when it needs to be i never touched my system while leaving it at my usual volume and found it very comfortable throughout i do not even know where to begin to talk about all of the special features presented on this disc set there is a mountain of them to go through though as of this writing i still havent been through them all but i would have to say that a person who watches all of them could walk away knowing almost as much as cameron does about the making of this film every aspect of the films production is covered you also get on the fly comparisons of the various stages of motion capture pre render and final render all at the push of a button real time this is great for someone who likes to see instantly how the scene evolved into the final product that we saw on the screen almost an hour of deleted scenes are there too each one of them are unique and can provide insight on various scenes throughout the film there were actually a few scenes which i pondered being cut to begin with but i know they were trying to keep the pacing right documentaries the original script and scriptment the theatrical trailers an extensive production artwork montage exclusive bd live features etc the list just keeps going fans of the film will love it all im sure disc of the blu ray version has almost all of the cgi parts of the movie with the motion capture footage picture in picture for viewing as a comparison i really loved this it even had the love scene on it fox and cameron both stated to the press before the first home release that this collectors version was coming in november your option to double dip was on the table then and there this release is the definitive version for fans of the film i would even recommend it to non fans because of the extended scenes and how they in my opinion improve upon the story in a subtle way overall this film and this release receives no less than stars from me like any other blockbuster it has had its share of praise and cultural backlash but i feel its an epic popcorn flick worthy of anyones collection 
if you enjoyed dances with wolves sans tatonka and you appreciate the best computer generated special effects available today then youll love avatar it really is fun i wont take any points off for the story its a good one but its a common one which goes something like this explorers from far away arrive in a new world and the explorers want something however there is a problem in the form of an indigenous population one very special individual among the explorers who is both brave and open minded is chosen to make contact with the natives he meets a female member of the tribe and her fatherwho happens to be the chief directs her to learn as much as she can from the stranger the explorer and the girl fall in love as they learn from one another in the meantime the rest of the explorers get impatient they want what they came for so they initiate a fight at first the interlopers seem like theyll destroy the natives without a problem then that one brave man does the right thing and turns back his own albeit misguided small minded people in the end he decides to stay behind with his woman sound familiar it is the first part of the story is disneys pocahontas or more recently the new world which featured qorianka kilcher the second part of the story is dances with wolves thats okay because those are good stories and i really didnt mind seeing them again in this case the natives are computer generated images the role of john smith john dunbar is played by sam worthington as jake sully pocahontas stands with fist is the voice of zoe soldana who i really like as neytiri the protagonist the leader of the explorers is stephen lang who plays marine colonel miles quaritch sigourney weaver even has a role as the hard nosed but understanding scientist weaver adds to an alien feel to the project instead of north america the new world is actually a new world its called pandora instead of indians the native people are called the navi the difference between the older versions and avatar aside from the actors is the special effects which are extraordinary think of the film that has the best special effects youve seen was it one of the recent star wars films up walking with dinosaurs whatever it is avatar is at least half again as good as that the images of the navi are extremely realistic the fauna are dinosauresqe and relatively credible in terms of anthropology and evolution i wouldnt be surprised if scientists in those fields were enlisted for consults the landscapes are breathtaking the effects will not disappoint getting back to the story like pocahontas and dances with wolves there is an underlying political message which i believe most movie goers wont mind some may it comes down to the european caucasian imperialists are ruining the planet there is a reference made by worthingtons character jake sully that the humans had already destroyed their planet and would do the same thing on pandora if the navi did not repel them fine so for reactionary viewer you may have to bite your tongue a little frankly get over it if only to enjoy the film its ground breaking 
avatar fans rejoyce this is the ultimate set that is manditory for any blu ray collection avatar the highest grossing film of all time was amazing in my opinion some people do not like the concept or felt it was stupid i am not going to argue just state that i along with millions others loved avatar i thought it was plain amazing and changed the media world now they have released a longer extended cut of the film with extra minutes that are worth it some do not think that the extra footage would warrant buying it after buying the bare bones edition well i bought the bare bones and i traded it in to buy this it is worth buying this but not just because of the extra minutes but the hours of bonus features they are actually very immersive and worth watching minutes of deleted scenes and i whish the deleted scenes were finished in editing because i found the deleted scenes to further the story more than the additional footage anyways the movie was amazing and its still amazing and its made even more amazing with this extended footage get the set you wont be disappointed stop complaining about not having it in d 
all the negative reviews complaining whining the double or even triple dipping now its my turn to have my say i purchased this blu ray on earth day prize is reasonable cant complain i saw it in d in the big screen was afraid it would not be as good in d but how wrong i was this blu ray proved me wrong this disc looks great stunning razor sharp crisp i feel like im watching it in d without the glasses its pretty close i think every movie studios now should follow this example just put the movie by itself in one disc and the other extras or special features in another i am very happy and extremely satisfied with this blu ray in my opinion avatar is one of the best movies ever produced and it is now in my top favorite movies of all time mr cameron mr landau to all the amazing casts thank you so much for this great movie and for not making me wait to see it again until the end of the year looking forward for the release of the special edition directors cut happy earth avatar day to everyone 
avatar is simply a masterpiece superb in all departments storyline photography acting special effects message you name it this is a work of science fiction stepping a bit in fantasy and mysticism developed in the tradition of the good old sci fi masters as for the sfx instantly became a landmark in sfx impressive the way cameron improved cgi technology to reflect the real actor facial expressions in the cgi characters and also the seamless interaction of cgi characters with real actors the beauty and quality of the landscapes is spectacular avatar really took cgi to the next level other key highlight of the movie is how cameron managed to smoothly deliver an environmental message that effectively raises public awareness in a universal way here you might think of the spaniards discovering and exploiting the americas or european countries colonizing african countries or the u s army fighting the indian tribes or despite their completely opposite approaches avatar anddistrict are strong candidates to become the two best science fiction films of the abundant crop 
i purchased this movie as a gift for my cousin after she and i viewed my own dvd of this film it has such powerful messages and such fantastic graphics that it is definitely a collectors item while she and i dont always agree on the movies we see this is one that gets hands down approval and praise from us both i heartily recommend this film for everyone there are some important messages that we all could benefit from in it 
one of the best film creations of all times i first saw this film in imax d incredible real life animation combined with real life people the way ive never seen before 
thank you james cameron for bringing us avatar it is by far the single greatest movie experience i have ever had and i have seen lots of the greats i regret that you did not win at the academy awards for best film and best director i mean yeah ok hurt locker was kinda a cool movie but to be voted over avatar cmon that was a crime a real pity unbelievable injustice god bless you and i hope you continue to rule over all other film makers who you tower over head and shoulders please keep bringing us groundbreaking movies that astound and entertain us 
i had not seen this film at the theatre but bet it would be really something in d even in high definition the detail colors jump out maybe i could have waited for a more full featured dvd but this is all i really wanted so i am happy avatar is quite a story and at its heart takes a look at our war like approach to dealing with others be it here on earth or elsewhere in the future 
i dont care i never watch that stuff bare bones edition great wonderful film cant wait 
hey you dont say a review isnt helpful because you dont agree with the opinion expressed get a life all you people who go out of your way to down this incredible film need to just kill yourselves right now please just get up from your computer and walk to a window and throw yourself out first of all theres you people crying that they released another edition guess what people this is a capitalist society and this is how people make money what world do you live in you want there to forever be just one copy now and forever you actually think that a business is going to actually try to devise a marketing plan so you save money youre all idiots these people want to make money and if you were in their seat youd do the same thing its how you run a business you commie morons i bought the first addition when it came out and i proudly bought this extended edition because guess what i spend money on things i like its what most people do you idiots did the same with star wars blade runner and lord of the rings you people need to get a life i swear second of all all you people saying this film totally ripped off dances with wolves clearly havent seen that film in a long time its nothing like dances with wolves perhaps just that the outsider lives among the natives but thats it dances with wolves didnt even have any epic battles really it was an emotionally climatic film also the comparisons to pochahauntas ferngully and the last samurai i can see but every film borrows ideas from another no idea is original look at star wars its based on a lot of mythological tales inception definitely got inspiration from the matrix and even superman is practically a retelling of moses so all you people complaining go ahead stick to your ferngully and pochahauntas while i watch this amazing sci fi epic that takes a complete dump on all those films dances with wolves however is still a masterpiece third of all who cares if this isnt in d i dont know anybody who has a d tv you think these people are going to go out of there way just for you out of people and lastly many people cry that cameron is greedy for distributing so many avatar products but you people are ignorant if you actually quit being such cheap and checked out the documentaries on this blu ray you will see that he actually believes in the message in his films he goes to the amazonian jungles and lives among the indigenous peoples and campaigns for them in brazil to stop the deforestization of their homelands this guy really cares and he is using his money and power to make a change something you cheap will never do because all you care about is yourself and your wallets this is coming from someone who hates fox i hate fox with all my heart i think they are a fascist company i hate their news i hate what they did to the production of the theatrical release of alien i hate what they did to the production of x men and alien versus predator but i give respect where respect is due and avatar is a masterpiece and this is camerons baby not fox even if they get a cut they deserve it for believeing in cameronthis box set is great a lot of extensive bonus features like a box set should have and at bucks it was worth every penny on blu ray tons of deleted scenes a few i felt should have been kept in the film such as the rite of passage that jake did while doing the peyote like drug the dance around the campfire scene and the attack of the avatars scene the documentaries on both bonus disc are extensive as hell and are everything i could ever want out of the making of a film james cameron did a great job with this film and really broke ground with the technology what he has completed is taking motion capture to the stage of performance capture and it is evident on the screen because the navi dont feel cgi they feel like real actors good bye to the smeagol gollum and yodi recreations in post goodbye to actors actresses like mystique sitting in a chair for hours just for make up this is a film making milestone and all you haters are pathetic do what you do best sit on you fat butts and complain while real talented people make history 
the film little big man starring dustin hoffman and directed by arthur penn marked a turning point in americas perception of its history it was the fictionalized account of the unforgivable massacre by american soldiers of a southern cheyenne village at sand creek and of the totally justified revenge of the cheyenne and souix at little big horn a huge box office success little big man followed the fine book bury my heart at wounded knee both the film and the book lamented the genocide committed against the aboriginal peoples of north america in it was too late for apologies but the guilty conscience awakened by such a confession has persisted little big man was not perceived however as only about genocide it was recognized immediately as a repudiation of ecological destruction in the name of capitalism and progress a manifesto of environmentalism and as a parable of americas senseless criminal conduct in the vietnam war that war which the us armed forces lost despite their overwhelming superiority of war machines the hateful arrogant unredeemable villain in little big man was george armstrong custer when custer was finally rubbed out young americans cheered in theaters from sea to shining sea sound familiar all you who have seen avatar if you havent seen avatar stop reading i cant possibly avoid spoilers in this review the first two thirds of avatar is a remake almost scene by scene of little big man the paraplegic hero of the former coincides with the height challenged hero of the latter theres the same inter racial love story the same conflict between rivals and the despicable commander of the american occupying forces is custer resurrected in all his odious bloodlust also the use of napalm against a forest dwelling enemy is bound to remind some people of vietnam dont you think but this time in avatar the indigenes won hurray im with them pale face go home earthlings perish on your own ecologically devastated overheated planet the levels of analogy pile higher detail after detail of avatar resonates in the context of americas futile occupation of iraq and afghanistan as little big man alerted audiences to the ambiguity of americas role in vietnam one hopes that avatar will touch the psyches of americans who still insist that might can make things right in the middle east make no mistake movie goers this is a powerfully painfully anti american film yes of course the spanish portuguese english french dutch and belgians were every bit as guilty of genocide as the americans so one could argue that avatar is more broadly an anti colonialist film but but but all the characters are plainly americans in an american owned future and even more broadly its an anti capitalist film since the essential conflict it portrays is explicitly between the interests of share holders and the new world paradise being ravaged for mere greed gold being replaced in the story by the mineral unobtainium oddly enough its also a hi tech computer graphic exposition of the philosopher spinozas perception that nature is the sum of itself and an adequate explanation of its own existence if one only gathers enough empirical evidence and that therefore existence is identical to god and god is nothing more or less than the totality of existence i e nature now if that insight doesnt earn me a few dozen negative responses here on the amazon im a neanderthals uncle but nature has some mighty divine visuals up her sleeve on the sets of avatar i wonder how many people recognize that the whole film was shot on location in the interior of brazil where the indigenous people are still being ravaged for their unobtainium oh yeah the graphics are eye popping mind boggling paradigm shifting but everyone already knows that 
this is by far the best looking and sounding blu ray disc i have ever seen picture qualitythe picture quality is beyond description and is so clear that it is like looking through a window the colors are vibrant beyond belief every detail of every image is sharp and exquisite ive never seen anything like it for a home theatre system before the image had more detail than i noticed during the d presentation i saw in the theatre and the colors were even more vivid many scenes on this disc look as though they are in d there is that much depth to the images im beyond words to describe how incredible this disc looks audio qualityfor english language this disc offers dts hd audio and dolby i listened to the dts the sound is equal to the image every speaker in your system will be busy with this one rear speakers are in constant use with all sorts of immersive sound effects and the subwoofer will shake your house this is spectacular entertainment and unprecedented in home video history package and functionalitythe disc set comes in a striking reflective slip case the discs are housed in a standard sized two disc keep case with the left side containing the dvd and the right side holding the blu ray disc the disc menus are gorgeous and very easy to navigate pop up menu is quick and easy to read there are no forced trailers or advertisements before the menu pops up but there are the usual warning screens although my player is usually fast loading this disc took a bit more time to load than most about one minute extrasthere are none unless you count the dvd as an extra there are however two inserts one is a off certificate toward the purchase of a panasonic blu ray player the other insert contains an access code to the website which allows you to watch bonus material sneek preview stuff final thoughtsit isnt expensive it is well worth the money at least to me as i found it to be the most impressive home video release in terms of picture and sound quality that i have ever seen buy it 
familiar plot with breathtaking graphics i especially enjoyed the coloring and flight of the dragons the characters ride in the film animation really captures the mannerisms of the actors in real life i pre ordered and was pleased the price at release was adjusted downward by amazon 
 up ahead was pandora remarks our central character jake sully and james cameron has finally unveiled a project to match his planet size ego gazillions of stuff already posted regarding this movie so chances are ill only be regurgitating but i side with all the gushy raves avatar is phenomenal the cg is bloody brilliant and breathes dimension and life into the twelve foot tall navi there are significant plot points in the story which echo dances with wolves in essence avatar is a western masquerading as a sci fi flick as far as the premise with the human cripple who casts his awareness into an alien body off the top of my head author lin carters green star series written in the s featured this same basic hook but avatar takes this premise and injects it with solid storytelling enlivens it with an appealing cast we sometimes forget that james cameron beneath his jonesing for razzle dazzle knows how to tell a grand story again the man demonstrates remarkable execution man alive things have come a ways since who framed roger rabbit hasnt it the plotty plot jake sully a paraplegic ex marine journeys from a dying earth to the mysterious distant planet pandora and signs up to fill his murdered twin brothers slot in the avatar project the inhabitants indigenous to pandora are called the navi and they are humanoid and blue skinned and twelve foot tall on pandora jake becomes an avatar driver able to transfer his consciousness into a clone made up of combined human and navi dna the storys central conflict is that while the avatar program is dedicated to peacefully learning about the navi there is also a corporate entity backed by a strong military presence intent on harvesting unobtanium a rare super conducting mineral a rich deposit of which lies underneath the local navi village whether it was a sign from pandoras goddess or that this dumb grunt exhibits absolutely no fear jakes avatar shockingly gets an in with the hostile omaticaya clan and so the corporation also thinks it now has an in but jake finds himself wrestling with conflicting allegiances even as the beautiful neytiri tutors him in the ways of the navi jake must decide the time of great sorrow fast approaches will it be the blue girl and the exhilarating communion with nature or will it be semper fi and the jarhead clan and a chance to remedy his withered legs will it be the carrot or the stick imposed on the navi there really are very few unmissable cinematic events avatar is one of them the core narrative is not original but james cameron embellishes it with such monumental bells and whistles the cg technology is truly groundbreaking with eye popping imagery surfacing every damn minute im not really down with heavy handed message movies but i was drawn into the navis struggles against the encroaching human predators you have to credit the cast for making it into a hell of a compelling drama and sam worthington and zoe saldana generate massive sparks together sigourney weaver plays the tough scientist and its probably a wise move to change her characters surname from shipley to augustine shipley sounds too close to ripley giovanni ribisi gets the slimy paul reiser part from aliens stephen lang gets one of the juiciest roles he will ever get as the scary colonel miles quaritch hes amazing anyway i cant rave enough like most of you ive seen avatar a bunch of times now because this is a picture that rewards you with repeated viewings it works as a sci fi adventure film as an environmental call to arms as an emotional human drama as a love story and ooo rah there is even some classic deadpan marine humor as mentioned its a great western cloaked as a sci fi flick this is the disc dvd set featuring three different versions of the movie with the movie broken down into two parts and on two discs bonus footage includes more scenes of jake sully pre pandora dr grace augustine recounting to jake what happened to neytiris sister at augustines school and one final scene with tsutey as he passes the mantle of leadership on to jake disc features avatar part original theatrical release collectors extended cut with additional minutes special edition re release with additional minutes optional family audio track all objectionable language removed disc features avatar part original theatrical release special edition re release with additional minutes collectors extended cut with additional minutes optional family audio track all objectionable language removed a message from pandora james cameron reflects on the movies environmental theme and his own environmental works in the xingu basin brazil to prevent the construction of the belo monte dam which would negatively impact the tribes inhabiting that region minutes long disc the filmmakers journey direct access to new additional scenes for the special edition re release minutes but these are pretty much the scenes that were added to the collectors extended cut direct access to new additional scenes from the collectors extended cut never before seen deleted scenes the first few of which are comparison clips showing scenes before the cg folks got to them and then the finished product the exclusive in depth documentary capturing avatar i wish though that there had been an audio commentary track provided by james cameron and the cast but thats probably coming in the next new super duper even more special edition avatar dvd release oh you know its coming 
after seeing avatar i use that movie as a base to rate every other movie i see it was the most amazing movie i have ever seen 
i rented this film from the hd on demand channel of my local cable network i enjoyed this movie from start to finish and the special effects and animationreally knocked me out i also like the underlying message regarding the ecology andabout tolerance of other ways of thinking and being without being preachy a great mixture of real time acting and animation it deserved all its astounding success and accolades this film is entertaining to both adults and children and i willmost definitely be adding this one to my collection 
this movie is awesome it not only shows mans inhumanity to man it also shows his lack of responsibility for his own planet and all other living forms all those who only gave this movie star are either anti social irresponsible idiots or work for the american military industrial complex one or the other if youve got the confront and the convictions of a morally ethical person this movie is for you it is a movie about ethics love community mostly it is a movie about the will to survive as an individual a family a group and all living things this movie is awesome watch it and buy the special edition youll be glad you did all the best doc shillington
after all the hoopla on tv last year i did skip out to the theater to see james camerons avatar with my sons i had great expectations having seen aliens terminator the abyss titanic just to name a few of his blockbuster hits camerons films always come rolling in guns blasting edge of your seat action heart thrilling scenes and teeth gnashing bad guys the exact thing i love let me prepare you this movie is two and a half hours long it is not something you take a child under the age of eight to and expect them to sit still unless they love video games and the entire idea of getting sucked into their own avatar im into xbox so if you dont know what an avatar is heres the definition compliments of webster the incarnation of a hindu deity an incarnation in human form an embodiment as of a concept or philosophy often in a person a variant phase or version of a continuing basic entity an electronic image that represents and is manipulated by a computer user as in a computer game thats the entire idea behind this movie an alternative life from the one that you may have now ill give you a heads up whatever bad you may hear about the movie if you love camerons work ignore it avatar starts out a little slow if youre a fan of natgeo or the discovery channel programs the start of the film involves the subject of basic living among the navi the navi are the indigenous people thriving on planet pandora and their existence is being threatened by a major corporation that wants a crucial mineral that exists only on their homeland theres a purpose for this if you have an open mind my thoughts so called civilized man made it a point to habitat foreign lands and either convert or destroy the locals for their own gain as always the natives were refered to as savages lacking any idea of the knowledge the civilized race brought them because they were just so backwards and ignorant avatar explores the question would civilized mans thinking change if it were another planet cameron paraplegic hero jake sully has the opportunity to live among the navi in an alternate reality jake molds bonds and begins to understand he sees this new world and the natives for what they are far more intelligent than his counterparts believe there is a bonding between the navi and mother earth that is deep and profound calling back to the tales we read from our own heritage this film is intriguing beautiful a dynamic explosion that bursts from the screen the jungle the wildlife the navi the flora and fauna theres not enough words to describe the beauty of this movie its has captured the most breathtaking and believable artistic sense i have seen in years the drama and the greed brought on by what the navi have on their land is brought to light with the savagery that must have been experienced by the indigenous people that populated our own world in the time of discovery change or suffer the consequences with the possibility of mass genocide by the so called higher intelligence factor the hero jake sully has to decide what is more important the life he knew or the life that exists only in his dreams ill leave you hanging there because i hate it when the review tells the entire story all i can say was there was when i saw this film at the theater there was a hushed lull that fell over the audience during the entire film not a child cried whimpered or whined not a soul bounded up and down the stairs seeking refills or a bathroom break there was clapping throughout the audience when the credits rolled and my boys ages and were among them great great movie to add to your christmas stocking stuffer list 
many reviewers are mad about this movie not having extra features i can care less on the extras and its ridiculous not to buy a movie just cause it has none i love avatar cause of the movie not because i want to see some fat lady on the extra features putting make up on the actors nor a fat guy yelling cut take i sure dont remember any extras at the theather so its not a big of deal for me if the company its holding out on the extras thats just business theyre sure not putting a gun in my head and saying buy the special ed im buying this and only edition the minute it comes out for those who want to wait you all know deep inside your getting this edition 
after reading all the pathetic blathering and petty drivel about what this dvd release lacks no extra features no d effects etc i felt compelled to write my own review here so that people can learn a bit about the movie perhaps this is a perspective thing i hadnt seen the movie so i got this for the movie and not any extras the way a few of the reviews here sound though its almost as though a great many people have forgotten what entertainment actually is if your primary concern with buying a dvd is simply extra features and fluff then no thats not in this release and you can clearly read about that in others reviews if your only entertainment concern is having the best latest greatest technology such as a d television well thats not here either however if youre simply looking for a truly great movie with captivating characters wonderful visual effects and a really strong environmental message to boot then please read on ok unlike a others here again i had never seen this movie in the theaters in fact i hadnt even heard of it until the mcds kids meals started featuring the toys even as i stood there inserting the dvd in to the player i didnt even know that sigourney weaver was in it which was a very pleasant surprise thats how little i knew about this flick before hand i honestly wasnt sure what to expect that said last night made the rd time ive watched this movie in just over week this is simply a truly outstanding flick hands down ill try not to spoil too much of the actual plot for you but essentially this is a sci fi flick that is a combination of live action and some excellent cgi in a rather small nut shell the time frame is some time in the distant future where humans have started to explore space and colonize other planets in this case a base has been set up on a very distant planet actually in the early sequences it looks more like a moon in orbit around a large jupiter like gas giant known as pandora which was intended to apparently be some kind of mining operation it seems as though some large earth corporation is interested in a rare metal which can be found in abundance on this planet called unobtainium and if you think thats cheesy look it up on wikipedia the problem is the planet has an indigenous species known as the navi a foot tall race of blue humanoids who at first appear to be quite primitive they live in the trees they hunt with bows and knives etc etc what we come to learn is that these people while they are a tribal like culture have a strong connection to the planet and all the living things that grow there and they understand the inter connectivity of all living things on pandora needless to say the navi want to protect their home the navi are not totally dis similar to tribal people who have actually lived on this planet people who have been virtually decimated by modernization and so called progress and the ideology of western culture imagine the native americans of this planet before the arrival of the white man thats the navi only theyre blue and really tall pandora is much as early america was im sure not the most hospitable place at times imagine how a person who had never heard of let alone seen lions or rhinos or cheetahs or hyenas would react on their first visit to the africa savanna the creatures of pandora are certainly alien but the idea is the same most of the wildlife on pandora isnt exactly friendly in an attempt to make nice with the locals the humans have bio engineered these avatars living beings created from a combination of human and navi dna humans are put in to these high tech chambers not dis similar to a cat scan or mri machine and go to sleep and when they wake up they are in their avatar bodies the humans who do this of course are all scientists and such who are trying to understand the people of pandora although the ultimate goal of the program is supposedly to negotiate with them in order to get them to relocate so the humans can get the unobtainium that is of course until our main character jake sully sam worthington shows up jakes an x marine who lost the use of his legs apparently in combat jake was selected for the program because his twin brother who was a scientist was murdered since jake was his identical twin with the same dna the powers that be decided to offer him the chance to be part of this program instead of course jake has no training and very little understanding of pandora beyond the legends hes heard on earth let alone the navi or little else really hes your basic jar head except that hes confined to a wheel chair because he is a warrior however the navi people accept him at least more easily than the scientists who have gone before him i wont go much more in to it than that as if you havent seen the movie theres plenty of spoiler info out there however this movie has a very strong environmental message while its a great action flick with awesome special effects to be sure the real meat of this flick is the message that it sends out in the time period of the movie humans have basically killed mother earth much in the same way we are doing today and now they are looking to do the same on pandora all for the sake of profit sound disturbingly familiar it addresses that almighty belief that many humans seem to have in that anything and everything is ours to take and destroy as we wish without any thought what so ever to the consequences or how it effects the environment of the creatures including people who live there with the facts and evidence of global warming here on our own planet quickly becoming indisputable this is a very timely movie with a very potent message a message that people should listen to and take to heart even without those dvd extras that some people seem to cherish more than quality entertainment this is a very strong movie with a very strong statement the visual effects are simply breath taking even without any bloody d the characters are engaging and often downright captivating the music sound track is very lovely to say the least and the cgi is simply stunning all and all an excellent flick for everyone in the family ok there is some mild use of bad language get over it seriously if youve already seen this flick in theaters and youre simply more interested in the extras than the flick itself then as others have suggested just wait for the special edition release if youre easily offended by someone telling you just how greedy petty and stupid we humans can be then dont watch the flick at all however if you enjoy good entertainment with great action strong visuals and a tremendous message that all of us could learn from this is a great flick and the dvd is well worth the cost even without any extras this one gets a solid stars in my book 
this is not a guy flick nor a chick flick both can enjoy watching it this is a right vs wrong action adventure love commitment trust betrayal heartbreaking humorous film avatar played with every emotion i have i laughed and cried got angry then cheered i really enjoyed this film 
this is a great edition to own and i recommend it highly to all fans the extras are just awesome 
 review is for d version only cant imagine it any other way ok this is the most astonishing movie i have ever seen first word i heard leaving the theater was amazing no doubt about it i wont discuss the plot suffice it to say the plot is good but nothing i repeat nothing can match the special effects of the d plot aside this movie is a visual feast for the senses the flight and fight scenes are magnificent heres the least you need to know its the best of all the action movies rolled into one sort of like lord of rings meets jurassic park meets dances with wolves meets tarzan meets transformers meets narnia meets rambo meets eragon meets apocalypto meets dragonslayer meets the most realistic video game you ever played you get the picture youre in the picture it is new age all the way christians will sneer at the earth mother reincarnation tree loving motif the we are all one with nature theme isnt pushed ad absurdum but if you arent into it better get used to it its a long movie nearly three hours and the parking lot was packed here in lexington be sure you have your snack in hand and your business taken care of theres a lot of cursing somewhat overdone in my opinion so keep that in mind when you take the kids the only thing remotely sexual is the hair bonding ritual now that was interesting so sexuality is not much of an issue there is a lot of creature death however the ending is as predictable as it is inevitable in this nature versus machine extravaganza sort of makes you empathize with how the aztecs must have felt when they saw cortez coming with the metal the last hour of so is truly the armageddon scenario for the world of pandora if youre not worn out from being pounded with the visuals and dolby super sound well just buckle your seatbelts and enjoy the final ride nevertheless i couldnt help joining the applause at the closing credits finally the special effects are astounding youll be reaching for the floating jellyfish tree seeds dodging the flying dragon birds marveling at the rare mineral unobtaniums anti gravity effect on the hallelujah floating mountains choking in the underwater scene and cringing at the drops and falls and jumps off cliffs this stuff is so good you quickly stop asking yourself how they did it and simply sit there and experience it you really are in the movie there you have it without giving away anything bottom line just pay the extra bucks and get the glasses appreciate the creative mind that could come up with such a story and get lost for three hours in a world of sight and sound you cannot imagine only the smell is missing if this is a preview of the future of tv im reserving my d model right now wow 
i have watched avatar three times now the first time the d version in the theaters the second and third times the extended collectors d version on this three disc set to paraphrase nigel tufnel of spinal tap i have concluded that this movie really goes to in my opinion it may be the greatest science fiction movie of all time surpassing even blade runner and star wars avatar is stunning to look at and listen to it is moving and exciting and it carries an unmistakable message about the sins of imperialism i also disagree with those who think that the script is wanting though there are no memorable quotes here as in casablanca the story points are well thought out and the script conveys a world of exposition in a very efficient and economical manner the acting is also very fine both of the humans and the navi with a special nod to sigourney weaver sam worthington zoe saldana stephen lang michelle rodriguez and giovanni ribisi as the requisite corporate scumbag finally i must also commend the remarkable score by james horner in my opinion the african inspired music here equals or surpasses anything composed by john williams or bernard herrmann and adds greatly to the movies impact what can i say this is a science fiction film for the ages and there are a good number of compelling reasons why avatar has become the highest grossing film in history for those who lack d televisions and blu ray players this three dvd collectors edition set is the way to go with a disk of extra features on the making of the film i just wonder how james cameron can top this film in the sequels to come 
its hard to find a movie appropriate for family viewing if you have young adults in the house special effects are very cool and the whole family loved the story and went away with a message about respecting life of all kinds sure the picture is a bit harsh on developers but it is just a story if you work in one of many fields where your profession is made out to be the bad guy then youre used to this i just cant rave about the special effects enough the animated characters are quite lifelike and very appealing id buy this movie again and id recommend it to the rest of my family and to you my amazon family 
is is how movies shoud be made when must of what you today are remakes of old movies that did well 
it is a great movie i am sure that most people have already seen it buy now and plenty have already bought the bluray dvd my opinion is thought i found the blu ray experience better than the d experience so much more clear and all the details they put into the movie are so much more noticeable
i have viewed more than blu ray movies on my sony w series tv avatar blu ray is so far one of the best in blu ray quality really beautiful pictures despite the story line which is not bad the picture alone is worth stars dont have a d tv yet i can imagine how good it is going to be in d blu ray the theater version has no comparison with the blu ray 
my daughter practically had to drag me out of the house to see avatar i usually insist on waiting to watch movies at home on my tv because movie theaters and i do not get along cant stand the dirt the crowds the over priced snacks the deafening sound systems etc im seventy years old and entitled to my crankiness when we got to the theater we discovered that their d projector was under repair my daughter was disappointed that id be unable to experience avatar that way but i wasnt looking forward to wearing weird glasses for hours because well you recall that seventy year old thing not seeing it in d turns out to be a really good thing why because now i have a good excuse to go see avatar again other reviewers have said just about all that needs to be said of the magnificent and groundbreaking qualities of this film so i wont trouble to go there again instead i will tell you of my personal reactions and thoughts avatar is a visual feast the details of the world and the creatures in it are amazing and simply beautiful it made me recall watching planet earth but this was an imaginary world of wonders created by a human mind the sheer glory of the planet and its people took my breath away brought tears to my eyes and gave me what i call beauty shivers the oneness of all things as expressed so beautifully in avatar is a truth that does apply to any ecosystem as we are discovering the hard way right now the religion of the people of the world in the film simply expresses gratitude to their deity and puts into action their recognition that no creature can make a move that doesnt effect all other creatures through interdependence and interconnectedness as it is said all energy is borrowed this same gratitude and recognition is very common in the philosophies of our world while watching the film i found myself thinking repeatedly of st francis of assisi who even carried a worm across the road so it wouldnt get hurt ditto gandhi there is reason to hope that avatar will encourage people to be kind to each other and to the world tree huggers and ecologists arise at the end the scientist and the awe struck child are the same being we should quit acting as though that isnt true the wizard of oz gone with the wind cinderella king kong and titanic have been pushed down a notch on the list avatar is now number one i cant believe avatar was around three hours long my seventy year old bones cant usually sit in one position that long but today i had an out of body experience at the theater great story avatar must be seen on the big screen then buy the dvd or blu ray as a memento thats what im going to do the comparison others have made between avatar with dances and wolves makes sense on a very superficial level but avatar outweighs all competition by a huge distance because of its depth and amazing creativity anne mccaffreythe dragonriders of pern poul andersoncall me joe the collected short works of poul anderson im glad i got to live long enough to see this movie thank you dear daughter for using force to budge me out of my recliner this afternoon okay now who can i get to go with me to the d imax version i can hardly wait 
this is a replacement for the first one that i thought my wife had worn out watched it over time but it was the player that had gotten a glitch but having two is better than one it is by far the best movie production ever and this package gives you a lot of behind the scenes stuff plus and extra minutes that are in my opinion crucial to the story i dont know why they were cut from the theatrical version in the first place 
 okay so people are upset that this dvd hasnt got extras and isnt d the movie itself is great i had not seen it in the theater because i cant see the d but i really dont think i missed much the screen is filled with lush vibrant visuals james cameron may go way over budget with his movies but every dollar is up there on the screen i have never seen anything like it the movie clocks in at nearly three hours do we really need a directors cut that makes it longer it already felt complete to me and as far as it not being in d how many people have gone out and bought a d tv yet not to many i bet that is why they didnt release it in d even if i could see the d i would not buy a d tv who wants to wear those stupid looking glasses just to watch tv if you enjoy well made action movies you cant go wrong with avatar it is fantastic i cant wait for the sequel 
the answer might surprise you the film has been described as a rehash of old themes chiefly the collision of civilizations the exploitation of indigenous peoples yet i wonder if this is a bit like saying that music is just a rehash of notes or a book is just a rehash of the alphabet if it is fair then it seems to me that the rehash would have to include many other things too not only the young orphan deer vs the thoughtless human hunters in bambi but also dreamer roy neary and scientist claude lacombe vs the narrow minded major walsh in close encounters of the third kind along with maria von trapp vs the nazis in the sound of music george bailey and friends vs mr potter in its a wonderful life even joe pendleton vs the gangsters in here comes mr jordan and heaven can wait as a science fiction rehash one would especially have to ask how many sci fi stories have had aliens come to earth taking on human form is this really a rehash of i married a monster from outer space i can only say no jake and neytiri waking up together in the glade of the tree of voices is bambi and faline waking up together only to face man entering the forest once again jake praying at the tree of souls is george bailey praying if youre up there and if you can hear me following the subtext of the history of cinema the old stories are the palette not the painting the innovation of this film is that we are the alien invaders taking on alien form hence we are incarnations of vishnu the hindu god or in other words the sky people sky people since we are from earth that is to say from the aliens point of view from the sky the avatars avatar literally means incarnation of vishnu if you ask me dances with wolves was the rehashed cliche this is something new this innovation serves to underscore the objectivity of truth and beauty in an otherwise pure cinematic landscape the story hinges on the main character jake gradually responding to that objectivity with a jaded life and a crippled body he volunteers to be an avatar simply with a whats in it for me attitude but gradually he comes to see things from a more encompassing perspective you see that the avatars were needed to negotiate with the alien natives was simply one of the theories of human beings apparently it was not true the planet welcomed not only humans but avatars it even welcomed its technology what it did not welcome were pirates who did not respect the order of creation the audience siding with the main character who at first plays both ends against the middle but instead comes to completely risk his position also comes to side with the navi who live in what appears at first to be a horrific world driving the point home are the characters tsutey a navi and norm spellman a human who each overcome an envy of jake and ultimately come together to fight by his side the problem of nemisis colonel quaritch was that the only thing he could understand or respect about pandora was its fangs the gradual shift from the initial impression of a horrific world to an impression of a world of immense beauty is the most impressive thing about the film i cant see how anyone would be inclined to believe that the would this movie depicts is factual or where there is any expectation that the audience should be so inclined e g to believe that there is a planet more precisely a moon where the trees on it form a single and central nervous system what could be more clear than that this movie is pure fantasy but in this story placed in perspective by understanding that it is a world of pure imagination there is the strong suggestion in the context of its plot not only of rich treasures of truth and beauty in an alien world but of a true religion which is also found there if the avatar hero is an incarnation of visnu then princess neytiri i suppose is his wife sita of the hindu epic the ramayana yet if one prefers perhaps instead she is eve showing adam after he awakens from his slumber gen the tree of life gen rather than the tree of the knowledge of good and evil when the sigourney weaver character just before she dies declares to the male hero she is real she can hardly be taken as having decided that men do not have souls does she is real really refer to the trees it seems rather she is speaking of the place of human beings in the navi religion the film does not propose any beliefs it simply suggests that a planet in the universe might have a true religion on it without denying the fact that the earth too is a planet in the universe i dont see how the movie is either new age or anti religious any more than it is inviting the audience to worship an imaginary planet the film could have had historian of myth and religion mircea eliade as a consultant no tree was ever adored for itself only but always for what was revealed through it for what it implied and signified the film is certainly one of the best science fiction films ever made well on par with the blockbusters since the s the true place of cgi in cinema also seems secure real actors for the living movement and expressions computers for the sets and costumes it practices what george lucas has referred to in witnessing the films production as using computers for digital makeup the story is very simple even archetypal but the movie is no less beautiful a triumph for those who have a liking for the blue monkeys you know those odd creatures of a nearby planet simply underneath some very unusual makeup hardly unobtainium locked away in a pandoras box they live on a planet that makes both the sky and the oceans look blue when seen from a distance but close up the flora and fauna come in many hues and the grass and trees are still green edit my review was based on the dvd sorry to have missed this one in the theater i now also have since seen it on blu ray my only addition to the review based on the blu ray is i concur that it is a visually stunning film with much beautiful detail which does not appear in the dvd version i do still rank the blu ray planet earth the complete bbc series blu ray as superior to avatar but that is not to take anything away from this film 
i didnt get a chance to see the movie in theatres but even without the d effects the most gorgeous and realistic cgi world ever in a movie is enough to blow me away this is the new era of moviemaking the first movie to truly fool my eyes to make me believe the cgi looked truly real and a part of the movie world was the first transformers and although there are some cgi aspects in this movie that could be improved the setting as a whole and the world of pandora is so beautiful that it truly deserves to be called its own true location the storyline is cliche but hey thats to be expected of a hollywood action blockbuster if you buy this blu ray its because you want to be immersed in the world of pandora probably one of the best top movies ever to watch while under the influence 
this movie is absolutely exceptional great story line great mix of special effects and absolute tremendous clarity in the picture i cant wait to watch it again 
this movie blows me away the visuals the sound and overall the performances from the actors yes actors as the actors played the animated characters in real life the cg then placed over their skeleton the only sad thing is no extras yes the picture quality for gbs i understand but they couldve released the various disc edition period will get it in november however as i didnt wanted to wait till november thats months ill have money in months right watched it blown away my favorite movie as of today stars avatar 
i missed seeing this movie in a theater so i hope it comes back i cant believe anyone was disappointed in the dvd i just upgraded from a tv to a lcd hdtv and this movie blew me away i loved it i remember how excited i was about standing in line to see star wars so many years ago and wish id done that for this one too the special effects are wondrous in my opinion james cameron was robbed 
truly mindbending avatar is everything you expect it to be from visual standpoint cameron has created a brand new world here for sci fi fans and it feels right that he is back home in the sci fi universe after the runaway success of titanic i was lucky enough to see this film at an advanced screening and all in attendance walked away in awe of what we had witnessed visually even if the story is lacking as a whole said story is set in the year and involves a mission by u s armed forces to an earth sized moon in orbit around a massive star this new world pandora is a rich source of a mineral earth desperately needs pandora is a planetary forest inhabited by the peacful and graceful navi a blue skinned golden eyed race of giants each about feet tall we nevertheless send in the military to attack and conquer though they are not a threat to us there is clearly a military allegory about the nature of war mongering and the noble savages who often end up standing in the way of the conquering superpower luckily cameron controls his narrative from falling into the muck before it becomes an offensive stereotype by imbuing the story with heartfelt if ocasionally stiff characterization the hero jake sully sam worthington is a paraplegic recruited because hes a genetic match for a dead identical twin who an expensive avatar was orignally created for on pandora jake is a good soldier and then goes native after his life is saved by the brave neytiri zoe saldana who if she keeps this great acting up voice acting in this case especially after star trek may find herself with rockstar status in the scifi universe sigourney weaver has a great turn in this film as well and turns in a strong performance it is wonderful to see her back in a james cameron film michelle rodriguez also makes a good turn in what could have been a throw away role visually he has unveiled the next generation of d in avatar and wow does it leave you in awe the interiors and rain forests in this film are like nothing you have ever seen and even the navi are rendered so beautifully you can almost use the word sexy both in their stop motion movements and the cgi the creatures in this film are also a sight to behold from the beauty of graceful flying dragons which contains one of the films best scenes as jakes tries to ride one of these beasts to creatures that look like a mix between dandelion seeds and a jelly fish and even the rendering of clouds there is beauty in every frame the entire range of his talent is on display here even more wonderfully he does so by never going so far as to create what some might call the th wall or d animation there is no need he has left that territory for other directors this is a world that lives and breathes in a way that is truly remarkable me thinks that if stanley kubricks characters in had travelled even further they may have found a race just like this trippy and glorious avatar delivers sci fi like we have rarely seen it making it a merry holiday for sci fi fans everywhere this one will be off the wall in imax get those tickets if you can you will not be dissapointed that you did trust me cast creditsjake sully sam worthingtonneytiri zoe saldanagrace sigourney weavercol miles quaritch stephen langtrudy chacon michelle rodriguezparker selfridge giovanni ribisinorm spellman joel david mooremoat cch poundereytukan wes studitsutey laz alonsodr max patel dileep raocorporal lyle wainfleet matt gerald
i loved this movie i loved the special effects the world that was created the philosophy of the navi what is sad though is the reality behind the fiction the movie adequately presents the reality of american military aggression and arrogance the we like to kill people attitude that is prevalent in some of our military the idea that killing people is just collateral damage and no big deal it realistically portrays our countrys very real attitude that american might is right that because we have the big guns we have the right to rape and plunder whatever and wherever we like it shows our disgusting imperialistic arrogance which if we dont change soon will destroy us is destroying us while we pour most of our money into war and war goods our country crumbles and our people go homeless and hungry this film has an important lesson for us that we do not own the world that might is not right that guns are not the way to peace i hope we learn it and soon 
ive watched this movie three times already and i just cannot keep my eyes off it i think its a wonderful great adventure movie ive seen in years when the extended version comes out buy it as will have extras and hopefully a digital copy 
we saw the movie in d imax which was fabulous the dvd may not be that dynamic but we really enjoyed the whole experience of seeing it again and again and again so glad we have a large flat screen and surround sound to enhance the home viewing experience i especially like getting the blu ray disk as well while we have not yet made that technology leap its nice to have that option built into this purchase just in case we do 
imagine a film about a greedy ruthless corporation one which treats its own workers like expendable pawns which brings about an unprecedented ecological disaster sound timely yeah this is not a biography of bp and the gulf oil spill this is the plot of avatar so its eerily striking that the film was released in the year before the gulf oil spill i did not watch this film in the theatre so i have not seen the d experience but this was the film that pushed d over the top commercially it was such a phenomenon that several tv manufacturers are releasing d capable hardware initial price range around and various media content producers are making plans for d content so in a couple years you may see a lot of dvds and movies and tv with d capability i dont want to dwell at length on the plot one viewer who didnt much care for the film said it was like dances with wolves set on another planet seeing the movie this made sense its set in a future when humanity has developed space flight no faster than light warp drive or anything it takes years to reach the nearest stars but exploration has revealed a very earthlike planet within reach more important it has a very precious resource not found on earth exactly what its supposed to be made of and what its used for were not fleshed out in the movie its dubbed unobtainium and it looks like a metallic ore of some sort the problem is that creating large strip mines also inconveniently means ripping up the planets ecosystem and even killing the native navi a tall slender but strong blue skinned humanoid race that live in harmony with their world the way american indians are portrayed as living more in harmony with the earth than the white settlers in dances with wolves as the film launches a practical scientific experiment is underway here it starts getting more far fetched in which bodies are grown with human donor dna combined with native navi dna then the human dna donor is supposed to be able to connect with the brain of the resulting body and therefore live in and travel around the world without special breathing gear the goal being to find a way to convince the navi to move off an especially large deposit of unobtainium else the company will simply bulldoze right over them this large deposit is inconveniently right under a major home for the navi people our heroes of course end up siding with the navi and against the corporation almost all the movie is computer generated there are probably a few sets like insides of buildings and ships that had some real backgrounds but all the outdoor stuff was computer generated as were the navi and once again like with star wars back in the day like with the lord of the rings films and like with ironman on blu ray this film marks a new pinnacle in computer generated film footage even without d but with the high def available on a good blu ray system this picture is drop dead gorgeous easily the most beautiful dvd film i have seen on a home system to date i think i can get a feel for what the d version might be like just watching the film on blu ray which just seem sharper and more real and more beautiful than any other cg stuff on dvd before yes everyones complaining that the studio released a bare bones version here no special features yes the studio is going to milk the film to the max a re release in theatre followed by at least one more dvd release actually im betting that over the life of this product there will be at least more dvd versions it doesnt matter if you havent seen the film in the theatre like me youre still gonna love it on dvd youll love it even more in d im sure in the meantime this still makes a helluva present for just about anyone who ever watches a sci fi film its quite suitable for older kids teens and adults 
wow i absolutely loved this movie i wish that i had seen it in the theater on the big screen this movie was very different and certainly right up my alley with the energy component it has awesome scenery gadgets and creatures its about metaphysical energy the spirits of animals and our connectedness to nature and each other its also about the terrible things men do for greed there are a group of approximately foot blue people who live on planet pandora they live in peace with nature and the land and live in appreciation and respect for all life forms shamanistic principles they are very much in sync with the energy vibrations of each other and spiritual beings there is a mineral that the earth wants that pandora has called unobtanium and this grey rock is worth mil a kilo earth has brought a bunch of mercenary soldiers to pandora determined to get unobtainium any way they can the avatar program is earths attempt to bond with the blue people and learn as much about them as possible to use the knowledge against them an avatar body is part human dna and part blue people each program participant has their own avatar linked to their dna so they can interact together as one to activate the avatar body you lock down into an electronic bed and meditate out then the avatar body awakens hence the name dreamwalker by the locals jake sully is a young wheel chair bound marine who received spinal injuries while fighting for his country his brother tom was a scientist who signed up for the avatar program when tom died the contract was offered to jake because jake has the same dna that was already linked to the avatar body grace is sigourney weaver the scientist running the scientific part of the program colonel miles quaritch is running the military section and he is a tough dude he asks sully to get inside the blue peoples heads and get him what info he needs to be able to control or conquer them and he will get sully his legs back when sully rotates home the operation is too expensive for jake to handle alone the blue peopls village is right on the richest deposit of unobtanium jake has months before the bulldozers get there to befriend the blue people and convince them to move out of the way so like a good little soldier jake heads to the dangerous pandora forest with grace and others running from a wild beast and barely escaping jake is lost in the jungle overnight where he is helped by neytiri father is clan leader chief mother is a spiritual leader shaman eywa is their name for god after a spiritual sign neytiri introduces jake to her parents and they assign neytiri to teach jake to be one of them its really cool to watch jake learn the spiritual oneness that these people offer as jake learns from and appreciates the magnificent beauty in their culture he begins to realize the war with the blue people is all about greed there is so much in this movie to appreciate the concepts of tying into the energy of all living things living in peace and gratitude sharing energy that we are all connected and all energy beings that there is a supreme spiritual being and spiritual helpers the concept of taming your dragon so much here that i already believe my sincerest appreciation to the writer director james cameron for putting this movie out for the world to see even if it is all just sci fi fantasy to you the storyline is great the colors are brilliant the creativity is fantastic the computer graphic imaging and animation is remarkable i think this movie has something for everybody i loved it its a movie that leaves you thinking about it i know i will watch this movie many times minutesnote my son said he saw a making of special on tv they hired a professor to make up some words to use as the blue peoples language the professor developed a whole new language just for this movie is that cool or what you will see the language woven into the movie with english subtitles note i see where another reviewer said a lot of footage was cut out not having watched it in the theater i was not aware anything was missing although i am anxious to see what was cut i loved this movie as shown 
since i did not see the film in the theater the first time i dont mind that this edition did not contain extra footage or a documentary on the making of this movie visually this film was hypnotic and stunning and is another great cameron accomplishment if you have not yet watched avatar on the big screen or video movie experiences this unique only occur a few times in the life of a sci fi movie fan note that the blu ray presentation was absolutely fantastic and the only thing missing was a d presentation update i just got back from seeing the imax d avatar special edition in the theater and wish to report that this newer more complete edition makes more sense than the first release because of the additional footage also the imax d experience was just incredible taking my aged eyes only a few seconds to adjust to the d format i hope they market this edition on blu ray and somehow get it into some good technology form of d 
was sorry to see the usual skeptics exhort negatives about this film futurereleases et al rest assured this is the most beautiful film ever produced and the transfer onto blue ray is beyond reproach the story line often maligned as transparent is as viable as a thousand other stories which are readily accepted this however is irrelevant as the colors bounce off the boundaries of your brain as the surround sound bounces off the walls in layers do yourself a favor and get the package with both a dvd and blue ray presentation so that you can enjoy it at maximum effectiveness either with the blue ray player you currently own or the player you should coax yourself into purchasing if presently without you could drive yourself crazy waiting for future releases with nebulous enhancements or simply purchase this film today and gape in appreciative wonder some individuals are educated far beyond their intelligence leave their pettiness behind you and treat yourself to this masterpiece as soon as possible 
i am glad i bought avatar it was surprisingly good and had a wonderful message to go along with the great story if we arent careful history will repeat itself compare this movie to what the government did to the native americans in the s 
i never saw the d version of this movie but many people told me it was good so i decided to purchase it in d to test out my new d tv well it was defn worth it i wont critique the movie i think may have done that already ill just grade the dness new word awesome the use of d in this movie was all that it was hyped to be the colors were vibrant and all chase fighting scences were all enhanced by d for those of use eager to find d movies worthy of purchasing well this is one alice in wonderland w johnny depp is another 
i rented this from netflix and watched it just to see what all the hype was about i never expected to love it it is sci fi and enchanted romance all in one i loved the special effects and the looks of love that went between the avatar the the people the tree of life on the hdtv big screen is so enchanting and beautiful with all the little pure souls floating around it so i came to amazon and got my own copy the first reviewer is correct there are no special effects how we did it clips or trailers bloopers on this dvd i didnt care as it was the movie i wanted many times i never look at those things anyway even if you are not into this type of movie i think this has something for everyone romance fantasy war fast action special effects i now use the saying i see you more often 
not sure what all the negative feedback is about no its not in d yet and there will be another launch of the product in the near future i wont be able to afford a d tv player for a long time anyway but for a extreme avatar junkie like me this was awesome the extended versions answered so many questions about the movie the school jakes past ect i would have paid just for the extended version you also get deleted scenes and behind the scenes which is so interesting and fun to watch and so many more extras for the price this is a great buy and so worth it just for the extended movie alone in my opinion it also comes in a nice little binder to hold the three dvds which is very nicely put together a great deal here on amazon and a awesome addition to my favorite movie 
this movie is absolutely without a doubt the first truly d movie it breaks boundaries that way that star wars did in its time the cgi is incredible and the d portion of the movie takes it to the next level the movie has a touching story that induces thoughts about the fragile nature of our earth while evoking strong emotions regarding the characters in the film cameron is a true visionary and his ideas come together fluidly leaving the viewer in complete awe this film should turn heads without d but when you add the d aspect to it there is a clear jump into the timeless classic category go buy a d tv d blu ray player some d glasses and this d movie and you will not regret it the required investment to start your d journey is considerable but the new technology is relatively cheap in comparison to where plasma tvs were when they were released and this certainly takes a great leap that tube television does to flat panel this movie alone makes it worth the investment bow to eywa 
this bluray of avatar is simply stunning it is by far the best bluray transfer ive ever seen both audio and video are flawless as one who preferred the non d version this is the perfect buy i am not going to review the movie as im sure most of us knows it pretty well by now i can highly recommend it 
i did not see the movie at the theater i heard a lot of comments about it mostly raving over the special effects and characters i wondered if the movie would live up to all the hype i was not concerned about the movie being realistic i wanted to be entertained and drawn into the plot it certainly happened for me i liked the unusual idea of mentally transferring into a larger alien body the brightly colored scenes were a real treat the human commander was too eager for combat but history is full of competent men who got carried away with conquest the culture and flora fauna was different so you had no frame of reference it was a new adventure for the imagination 
this movie was a pleasant surprise as we did not see it in the theater it shows the battle between a race of beings that are fighting to protect their planet from greedy earthlings depicts the worst of humanity that are willing to slaughter their entire race and anything else that gets in the way if you liked the last air bender the hobbit and yes even oblivion then youll probably like this as they all fight the odds 
having purchased the movie in blu ray i could hardly wait to get home to view it saw the movie at the theater in d was pleasantly surprised when my blu ray version came very close to d all i can say is that should become a classic 
avatar is a great movie if not the greatest so far images colors originality tension and suspense makes it a most entertaining movie cameron has surpassed himself with this movie too bad this movie did not get the academy awards the message is clear in the movie preserve your planet or mother earth or perish we should take warning that we are borrowing energy from our planet and not returning it i watch this movie almost every other day cant get enough of it the movie was delivered on time and im very pleased with my purchase 
we enjoyed this movie and upon watching it we didnt find the plot shallow as some critics suggested in fact i think it should have won the best picture award for however the oscars has a long tradition of often awarding things in their own way or honoring something else entirely by giving out their best picture so not to say foot locker didnt deserve consideration but i for one do not approve of war movies for money during time of war so no matter how well done it was it didnt have my vote for best picture and no i didnt see it that would make me a hypocrite maybe in years ill be able to bring myself to see it then perhaps not it took me more than years to be able to watch the mash series via dvdrelease even kudos to avatar a lovely fantasy land well done i hope there can be sequels that out do the original 
last night i was among the sellout crowd for one of the two midnight openings at the local imax in san francisco the most anticipated movie event of the year and it did not disappoint imax an exceptionally tall movie screen with an exceptionally sophisticated d state of the art sound system donning my d glasses i wondered what to expect even though i arrived early so did everyone else so i recommend an early arrival to get a good vantage point jake sully former marine gets drafted in to replace his twin brother recently passed on a very important mission to the planet pandora at great expense his brothers dna has been sampled and combined with the local somewhat humanoid species to create a hybrid which can be controlled remotely in this guise an avatar an identity assumed in order to interact with the local species and complete the mission jake enters the world as we do knowing nothing about pandora or the navi people as we observe with our d eyes we experience the world as he experiences it we come to know and love this world as he does and we care about its people as he does as jakes virtual world becomes more compelling than his real world he inevitably becomes torn between his mission to attain the unobtainium and his choice save his legs save the world avatar reportedly cost over million to make and the money is not invested in a name star but to greater effect in stunning visuals and groundbreaking technology our d experience is not gimmicky like other movies but rich and possessing both dimension and depth director cameron goes all out to be totally original in this movie in every way even in its d appearance and in so doing ushers in a new era in moviemaking avatar as a movie has so many different levels spiritual psychological emotional physical ecological a hero and a heroine who shares her intuitive gifts a vicarious adventure some of these are so subtle because as the mind becomes occupied with the visual spectacle and the beauty of what you are watching you many not even notice that even though none of this movie is set on planet earth your mind in searching for connection with what it already knows goes to unusual places almost like you have a double awareness a hypnotic experience a d way of looking seeing both sides of the coin at the same time it says a lot about our world our history and our time without saying anything the greatest accomplishment of this movie seems to be something that cannot be seen but can be realised its as if cameron goes into our home which is more of a mansion than we imagined and opens all the windows and opens the locked doors and lets light in everywhere and you think i didnt realise my house was this big and i havent seen that before i can hardly wait to see this movie again im hooked undoubtedly avatar will be huge it deserves to be a unique and new moviegoing experience i hope you found this helpful 
this movie is probably the best one ever filmed the characters are amazing and the film absorbs you so much that you do not realize the length of it the theme of this film is an old one but a goody this is a must for everyone

yes theyre going to milk this thing as long as they can over two and a half billion isnt enough evidently but what gets me is this the argument for a bare bones disc is to give the film as much space as possible for the best video and audio on the disc ok so what happens when the ultimate version comes out in the fall with the added footage that they are rumored to include speculation on the net is that there could anywhere from ten to forty additional minutes of footage added to the movie so do we then get a movie of less quality to squeeze more footage in or is this claim for the bare bones release just a lot of hot air i like the movie a lot and have already preordered this title just very suspicious of the claims being made for the bare bones release and the ultimate version later this year maybe camerons press release on the rd will shed some light on this and perhaps some sequel news 
i was blown away the first time i watched avatar and of course i wanted to own the dvd but at the time of the original dvd release the public was informed the special features and extended version wouldnt be out until this winter thats why i dont understand all the griping about the second release there are a lot of people who didnt want to wait that long and bought the bare bones edition but that was an informed choice just as others chose to wait now my waiting is over and i am happily looking forward to nov to see the nuts and bolts on how they made this groundmaking filmi have no doubt the wait will have been well worth it
all i can say is wow i had seen all the promos for this movie starting last year and i figured it would be just another movie so i bought the blu ray to see what the hype was all about i have seen some great movies even this year with the blind side i did not think anything could top it avatar just exceeded every movie i have ever seen even my personal fav merlin all i can say is wow simply mind blowing believe the hype james cameron would do us all a dis service without an avatar and get this blu ray now it will be a prize in your collection for years to come 
there are a lot of wonderful in depth reviews for this movie and im a johnny come lately i know however that i have been well fed if after three weeks of seeing the movie i am still thinking about it how many movies can you say have had an impact on you an impact strong enough to help you rethink about what we take for granted and how easy it is for some humans to take something that isnt theirs to take its a story that has been told by many people and cultures about living in a place of stark beauty and the monster of envy crushing that beauty in this story the people fight back but they arent enough to push back the intruders what transpires thereafter is awe inspiring to even the most insensitive soul i have been surprised however that there have been a few people who watched the movie and they just plain said i dont get it then i smile because i think thats the theme of avatar the war between those who dont get it and those who do 
its quite a simple choice really if you just want the movie buy this one if you want the bonus features wait until november if you want d wait until whenever its pretty simple theyre upfront about the release strategy so quit yer whinin and bitchin bout double dippin 
avatar is unlike any film ive ever seen the envisioning of pandora itself is mind boggling the performance capture effects unlike anything previously seen while the script is nothing overly outstanding the movies epic scale and sheer entertainment value is what movie making should be and ultimately should have won oscars for both cameron and the best picture its an amazing feat 
ive tried all day since getting my dvd in the mail to come up with really good words of praise for avatar i just dont have enough words to write a long stunning review so ill keep it short it is seldom nowadays to see an epic motion picture that keeps you glued to your seat throughout i am happy to say this is one of the best in my memory the storyline was perfectly written the cgi and especially the merging of cgi with live action was perfectly done i have watched it three times in succession today and really hope mr cameron does a sequel soon or edit i cant understand how many people actually missed the enjoyment in this movie or were disappointed only because their disk didnt have extras on it sure it has obvious similarities to other movies i constantly thought of dances with wolves all through it but i consider that a major plus this movie does something that very few movies do it touches us deep down inside where we exist if you have that special place double locked and isolated in your life then youll miss everything important in the story but if you have it open then youll feel the tingles all through your body while watching avatar ok ok enough existensionalism heh heh for those who truly want to know if this is really a good buy yes it is 
i find it amazing that so many of the people who reviewed this disc whined about it having no extras i buy a disc because i want to watch the movie and enjoy it over and over i have no interest whatsoever in all the extras deleted scenes commentaries interviews bells whistles fireworks violins etc that clutter up most movie discs today that is all nothing but an excuse that the studios can use to double the price of the disc and they do nothing to enhance the enjoyment of the film this disc was fine for the purpose of anyone who wants to enjoy the film what is even better is that even though it reads as widescreen it was put out in an aspect ratio that makes it fill virtually the entire screen of your tv set i throughly detest the widescreen format that leaves you watching a movie that fills the center third of your screen with huge black blocks at top and bottom what exactly is the point of buying giant big screen tvs when movie discs leave one third of your screen blank at the top and another third blank at the bottom leaving you to watch a movie squeezed into the middle of your screen i was not able to see avatar in the theaters so i wanted to see it at home and when i did i was enchanted the fantasy world of pandora is utterly breath taking with colors so vivid you wonder if you ever saw real color before this cameron has done it again someday the film world will stop doubting him bigger better more amazing more entertaining he does it all film reviewers keep grouching that his characters are steriotypes his dialogue clunky but i think i am sensing sour grapes here i think all the critics wish that they could have made a movie that was not only marvelous but made so much money it is unbelieveable as for steriotypes did you ever wonder why something is a steriotype mostly because it is a character that speaks deeply to people and is very very popular the story of avatar is that of a weary hero very much abused and alone finding himself willing to risk everything even his chance at a new life for a girl a people and a world he has come to love the hero that stands against great odds to defend what is right is an eternal figure he has existed in every time land and race since humanity began to dream humanity needs such heros real or fictional we all wish we could be such heros the filming of avatar is ground breaking the story ideas interesting the visual effect gorgeous you fly with dragons run through giant forests fight enemies find love taste disaster and triumph the basic story is simple but all the very best stories are especially the ones that last as i think this one will so get this disc enjoy the movie the adventure and the beauty it is a fantastic feel good film and theres not a damned thing wrong with that as far i can see 
what a bunch of whiny babies the absence of extras on the blu ray is because the bit rate is so high that it took up all of the memory this is as close to perfect blu ray as you can get sure there will be many versions down the line this one is just fine for what it is avatar the movie it was never intended to be a special edition its which is well worth having this beautiful albiet plane version to watch and enjoy the rest of you get in line with the cry babies waiting for the lord of the rings special editions 
this movie aside from its excellent cinematography is extremely informative in the way it speaks to us about multi national corporations and governments and their evil corrupt and criminal behavior and their disrespect towards other life forms other people and cultures unlike european ones people really to contemplate upon the dialogue in this movie a whole lot more than usual there is a lesson here for those willing to listen this is too much like what has transpired on this planet and continues to transpire in real life on this planet great movie five stars 
i saw avatar in d twice once in an all digital theater and once in imax d still while i enjoyed the d experience the dvd is well worth buying visually rich and the colors are sparkling i love watching movies in d because frankly they usually have more color due to not having to wear those theater glasses that mute everything a bit the audio is great too there is no need to review the story or the performances this is one movie where you either like it or you dont and most people have already seen it in theaters anyway so the question boils down to whether or not you would like to have your own personal blu ray copy to watch on your own television i cant imagine anyone being disappointed with the quality of the dvd it is well worth buying 
great movie great blu ray all three versions of the film are on the first disc and the picture quality is excellent the nd and rd discs are filled with special features the packaging is similar to a digibook but with an extra sleeve that it slides into the discs are each stored inside their own page of the book 
just had to weigh in on the comments everyone always has something to complain about remember when the bare bones edition came out everyone whining about the lack of special features now you get three versions of this movie and full of special features guess what we are still not satisfied what is up with you people the three hour extended version is alone worth the double dipping loved the new beginning on earth really gives us an insight to the attitude of our lead character and all the other added scenes cannot wait to triple dip when the d version comes out so i will have a reason to get a d tv this week alone several titles came out in d with d blu rays included i have already started my collection it is a smart move for studios to release the two versions together instead of having us to re buy the movie which most arent worth it only avatars worth that to get the newer format this three disc set of avatar is a materpiece of a blu ray it is sad to read all the people still holding onto dvd dvd is a dying format people blu ray is awesome when done right there is so much detail you are missing on dvd let this avatar box be a reason to jump on the blu ray bandwagon because movies like avatar were meant for blu ray you will never look at video the same again 
got my blu ray in the mail last night having just seen the movie in d at the theater about weeks ago i figured i was in for a letdown not this is a very impressive blu ray by far the best picure quality yet on a blu ray that i have seen as far as the reviewing the movie i like that some of sci fis best ideas can be merged into one movie and the resulting movie being so good i will admit that i leaked a few tears when the sigourney weaver avatar died and i was not the only person doing so james cameron makes movies that feature complete character development easily understood story lines and superior visual effects that show remarkable attention to detail it is a shame that i can only give it a rating 
simply put this is the most stunning blu ray ive seen the colors the detail are simply remarkable yes it is a double dip as fox and cameron have always admitted a more elaborate edition is on the way it is no secret so if you dont want to buy a strict movie only edition dont buy it im not sure why people are upset as clearly there is a choice offered the movie is only months old theres no time to assemble alternate cuts and the no doubt in depth supplements well see later so every official announcement stated plainly this was a movie only edition with a loaded version to follow giving you a choice buy rent or wait so its really not clear how people are being ripped off the movie itself plays much better in dd as opposed to d the story while simple and told many times before works well my girlfriend was even drawn into the film and liked the love story elements the movie is epic no doubt sweeping and grandiose entertaining and exciting the gorgeous blu ray presentation earns the highest rating this will be the movie people show their friends and family to show off their hd tvs 
i didnt expect to like this movie in fact since i dont ever watch previews i actually thought it was going to be a kids movie was i ever wrong while this review is probably not going to be helpful to those who are familiar with the movie and eagerly awaited its release im hoping it will be helpful to those like me who may not have seen anything on it beforehand or just heard snatches of information regarding the movie avatar features the world of pandora a place that has been discovered by us earthlings many years in the future while our technology has advanced we have ruined our world while toxic pandora creates a lure for earth in the form of unobtainium yes that made me laugh however another surprise is the sentient humanoid race called the navi these are giant blue human looking creatures that have tails and a special braid that allows them to connect to the world around them one of the humans who came to the human base on pandora jake is chosen to replace his brother as part of the avatar program the avatar program is a computer generation that can put a persons mind in the biologically created body of a navi with this they hope to learn more about the people well most hope it because of the unobtainium the main desire is to relocate the navi from their home where a great stash of it is buried using military efforts if necessary jake is chosen to go undercover for the military effort and report back on the navi weaknesses by luck he is separated from the avatar group in an animal attack and saved by neytiri a navi huntress she brings him back to her clan where he is not killed but instead taken in to learn how to be one of them over time he might change his mind about the navi home but would he be able to convince those who desire the unobtanium or the military power the graphics in this movie were wonderful it was quite impressive what they were able to do in replicating people and all the special effects while a lot of fuss is made over this first version being released without all the special features i honestly dont care if its in d and has a multitude of special features its a movie seen on a square screen and i like the fact that it looks like a movie im not too invested in trying to make it real so this version was perfect for me i also enjoyed the music they seemed very fitting and the song that played to the credits i thought was especially beautiful the characters were all well portrayed as well and there arent any actors i thought someone else could have done a better job my only complaint about this movie is that it is a little disheartening in regards to the human race the vast majority when you look at percentages were not good people and even more terrible was the fact that we destroyed our earth and had no qualms about doing it to another one with little thought to the local populace id like to think that the percentage of good people would be higher in real life as this is a movie though i have to forgive this concept for the theatrical relevance in all i thought this was a wonderful movie however it should be warned dont as i did think this was for children there are violent scenes and vulgar language little ones might want to avoid the movie but if youre ok with older children hearing cuss words it should be ok for them if youve got a friday night to spend on the couch this is the movie to see 
let me start off by saying that i am one of the people that saw avatar multiple times in theaters and loved it the cgi as well as the d technology infused were by far the best i have ever seen james cameron and all of the people who participated in the making of this movie did a tremendous job weta workshop is taking its place at the top of the mountain as far as visual effects companies go watching this movie was like being transported to a different universe i was completely immersed throughout the almost three hours i was in the theater as for the story and acting for the film i am probably in the minority on most of these reviews the story for me while predictable and reminiscent of other movies id seen previously what movie isnt nowadays was extremely enjoyable watching this made me feel young again it made me forget about all the worries that an adult life brings and just enjoy myself in the moment many people argue that the acting in this movie was subpar these people say that the portrayals of the characters were downright cartoonish i would argue strongly against that for the type of movie that this is the good versus evil portrayals given by the actors works in the movies favor sam worthington especially does well if you havent seen him in terminator salvation do so he made the movie worth watching now to get to the actual product at hand i ordered the blu ray dvd combo pack from amazon from the moment the menu came onto my screen i knew this was going to be something special when i pressed play there was no turning back over the next three hours my senses were completely assaulted and my mind was dumbstruck simply put james camerons avatar on the blu ray format is the best picture and audio we have seen or heard to date i have a feeling it will be years before anything better is brought to the table watching the visuals was more stimulating than looking at a real life forest every detail could be seen from far and away the walls of my house shook and i just hope the neighbors did hear i would tell them to buy the movie themselves and experience it with this release comes certain issues while i dont have any of them myself i will still talk about them as it would be uninformative of me to not this release of avatar is not in d many people complain about this and a large percentage of those people do not even have the right equipment to properly experience d yet the technology for home theater d is very new and very pricey next year after all the quirks have been worked out is when we will likely see avatar in a home release d format another gripe is the complete lack of special features this again has a good reason in the special edition coming later this year there will be scenes incorporated into the movie not even visually completed yet documentaries in high definition have to be put together a commentary track needs to be recorded no one is being forced to buy this stripped edition however i am one of the people who will knowingly double or triple dip on this the reason for that is because i love it so much now to the biggest complaint during the initial release many people were complaining that avatar would not play in their blu ray players the reason for that seems to be some new copy protection put on the disc while i was not one of the people with this problem i can certainly sympathize with those who did a new firmware update is all it will take to fix the issue my ps which serves as my blu ray player had a firmware update ready for me before i watched the movie so if you are one of the millions who loved avatar when you saw it in theaters or one of the people who didnt get around to seeing it now is your time pick this movie up right away without hesitation keep an open mind and let yourself become immersed you do not want to miss what many people believe is one of the top movies of all time 
once in a while a movie comes along that manages to encapsulate an entire subset of human experience within hours of on screen entertainment the ten commandments with charleton heston is a good example of such a film along with gandhi and ben hur i would put avatar into this discussion as it is that great of a movie the plot is simple enough in the far future mankind has discovered a planet rich with a valuable resource mankind has sent its military to acquire this resource the military funds a science research program whose goal is to convince the natives of planet pandora to quietly step aside so they can mine this resource known as unobtanium this resource cannot be breathed or ingested and instead looks like a cross between oil and coal and hence i assume is needed by mankinds corporations one of the military gradually switches sides and leads the natives in a successful uprising that defines the movies climax and probably accounted for most of its budget the greatness of this movie lies in three things first it creates a world that is the most unique complete believable and original setting since the planets seen in the original star wars trilogy a lot of other movies have created entire worlds from scratch such as the lotr and narnia movies but none have so completely created a believable ecosystem of plants animals and different environments in which predator and prey interact like they do on earth second the depiction of the fictional navi race is astounding from their courtship rituals to initiation rites to social structure and so on its as if james cameron hired a crew of anthropologists and sociologists to work on this movie third this is the first and only american movie i have seen to clearly and completely illustrate the following principle scientific research is set by military policy which in turn is driven by corporations which in turn is focused on the acquisition of non renewable resources to be able to pull this off in a hollywood dominated by the pentagon is quite an accomplishment and by itself makes this movie worth the money and time to watch 
i was realy skeptical when it came to this movie i heard about the new tech involved and thought that it was going to turn out to be a graphics heavy slash no story movie just like i just bought the movie to see what the fuss was about no one likes to be wrong but in this case its a ok great story line fantastic characters and its amazing how they made them all seem so real pretty cool in my book dont let the idea of computer generated graphics turn you away from this they really brought it to the next level 
avatar d blu ray is a panasonic exclusive until the end of feb after that the price will drop to that of a regular d blu ray release and it will be freely available to all without buying a panasonic d kit with second gen glasses and a bunch of junk via amazon and the like not long now 
you can lose yourself in this movie takes you on a wild adventure thats sure to resinate in your memory 
let me come clean right up front here so opposed to the hype surrounding avatar was i that i literally refused to stand in line with the drones that flocked to the theatres a few months back friends of mine went down one by one succumbing to the propaganda the rave reviews the hoopla but alas i was steadfast in my resolve hype or so ive concluded throughout the years is a film destroyer it has the capacity for raising expectations beyond whats achievable and after all unmet expectations is simply another way of saying disappointment with the exultation surrounding s avatar i feared there was only one place for it go in my appraisal and you can be sure my having held out for so long before finally giving the film a chance was an abstention laced with ambition of discrediting those critics before me who were haplessly tripping over themselves with admiration after all i reasoned computer generated imagery is essentially the bane to modern visual storytelling and you would be hard pressed to find a movie more dependent upon it than this one i am the stick in the mud who will always take the original star wars trilogy over the more recent one star trek ii the wrath of kahn over the retooling s clash of the titans over the cg heavy remake and peter jacksons lord of the rings over oh wait so there is one example of technology laced filmmaking that has managed to rival my definition of classic visual storytelling it turns out my plans of disputing avatars unrivaled ambitions were very short lived indeed and i shouldnt be all that surprised either this is james cameron after all the man who brought the world the terminator aliens and titanic it seems like about once a decade cameron becomes inspired enough to remind everyone in hollywood how its done perhaps his greatest ability aside from having an uncanny knack for telling stories that capture the very highest highs and lowest lows of the human condition is his knack of suppressing the temptation to simply harness the latest techniques in filmmaking but rather to surpass them even if it means reinventing the very process itself but before i get ahead of myself here lets take a moment to review the hard facts tracing its development roots as far back as when cameron wrote an page treatment for the film avatar is set in the year when humans are mining an abundant mineral called unobtanium on pandora a lush natural satellite of a gas giant polyphemus in the alpha centauri star system though officially budgeted at million estimates put the actual cost of the project closer to a little over million in production alone with some additional million for promotion it premiered in london on december and was released theatrically overseas on december and in north america on december where it immediately began breaking several box office records it went on to become highest grossing film of all time in north america and worldwide stealing the title away from camerons own titanic which had held the records for the years prior avatar was nominated for nine academy awards including best picture and best director of which it captured three best cinematography best visual effects and best art direction according to cameron himself the film is composed of computer generated elements coupled to live action and makes use of traditional motion capture miniatures models as well work on the film had been delayed since the mid s if effort to allow filmmaking techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray the projects unique vision since photorealistic computer generated character models were an absolute necessity cameron integrated new motion capture animation technologies he had been developing in the months leading up to december among these was an improved method of capturing facial expressions whereby the actors wore custom made skull caps fitted with a camera positioned directly in front of the actors faces at all times their facial expressions and eye movements were then transmitted to directly to the computers for animation layering additionally numerous reference cameras were implemented to provide the digital artists multiple angles of each and every performance so as to provide unprecedented shadow effects and reflected light between digital elements so even in taking into account all of the inconceivable digital techniques required to make the film possible at all a budget that could make bill gates sweat a roster of production talent with credits predating the use of panoramic lenses and some of hollywoods brightest up and comers and most revered veteran actors alike what is the avatar experience like its surprisingly impressive and im not referring to the superfluous visuals alone either michael bay has certainly proven to the world that eye candy alone does not a good film make avatar opens with sam worthingtons character jake sullys narration an appropriately drab tone that hints to the conflict within him that will later become the core of this grand tale there are undeniable homage cues that fans of camerons aliens will certainly recognize in the early sequences especially long distance space travel with cryogenic suspension a rigid and heartless military a greedy corporation behind the financing of the operation and so on in fact now that i think on it there are even mechanized loaders present and sigourney weaver to boot all thats inexplicably missing is bill paxton believe it or not a strong argument could be made that avatar is in fact simply the inverse of aliens in that both tales work from the idea of human beings forcefully annihilating an alien race on their own turf aliens does so with the humans best interest in the foreground avatar tells the same story only this time from the point of view of the victims the undertaking by which cameron manages to switch the viewers loyalty from his fellow humans to the indigenous inhabitants of the alien world pandora is nothing shy of genius much of the films minute runtime establishes momentum to accomplish this feat rather than force feed the good guys and the bad guys here cameron approaches the tale by presenting the opposing points of view pretty evenly and simply steps back to allow the viewer to decide who is right in the debate in the end and certainly a forgivable trait the conflict becomes a bit more black white the hope of course is that by then the viewer will have chosen sides with the same conviction that drives jake sully it would be impossible to skate through this critique without mentioning the highly publicized visuals and while i am doing all i can to avoid heaping praise on an already mountainous pile the truth is that the visuals deserve a lot of the credit for taking what boils down to a typical tale of imperialism oppression and suspension of rights that in many spots plays out eerily similar like events from our own history books and turns it into an ethereal experience that isnt soon forgotten for not only was the production crew charged with the arduous task of showing in intricate detail an entirely fictional world they had to create an entire race of inhabitants that though more animalistic than human beings were every bit as human as we ourselves and perhaps more so at times failing to inspire viewer sympathy for these primal pandorans could very well have been the kiss of death for the entire picture but such concerns are futile as cameron and company nail the objective a hundred times over by the films conclusion chalk it up to a combination of solid casting and lessons learned from classic animated films from the likes of disney the digital animation process here uses oversized eyes and near caricature like overly exaggerated features of the character models to ensure the complete and utter inescapability of the viewers emotional surrender further tying the prose together is the patented james cameron love story a bittersweet poignant whimsy that somehow manages to break down the emotional walls of even the most impassive and skeptical of viewers and with that comes an indescribable feeling of tension throughout the entire experience in simply knowing that cameron is no stranger to concluding his works with the death of characters you come to know and love in the name of timeless artistic tragedy throughout the film i found myself struggling to maintain a level of emotional detachment out of sheer remembrance of kyle reese young newt and a very popsicle like jack dawson the scoring is as is perhaps expected from a film of such high class production value top notch as well james horners soaring composures take the visuals to new heights sometimes almost literally while introducing a sort of tribal rhythmic tone to the formula that is ineffably appropriate while it presents no danger of dethroning john williams star wars theme as the most whistle able tune of all time there is little debate to the fact that avatars soundtrack will likely adorn the cd players of countless folks who until now wouldnt have considered themselves the movie soundtrack type so in all would i be so brash as to suggest avatar as a film that would appeal to nearly everyone surprisingly perhaps a self admitted science fiction aficionado i came in with high expectations of avatars highly publicized alleged revolution of the genre while it wouldnt be considered hard science precisely there is just enough space travel and mecha usage to keep my brood satisfied action junkies will surely find much to love here in this firefight heavy roller coaster ride and even the emotional set will likely clamber to the navi s portrayal in earnest box of tissues at the ready in fact i could go as far as to say its rare indeed for a film to come along with such universal appeal but then again to do so would be to discount camerons rich and extensive catalog of titles up until this one the man who made the world fear schwarzenegger admire sigourney and cry for that kid from growing pains has somehow managed to raise the bar again this time with ten foot tall blue skinned aliens and a story that offers irrefutable testament to the fact that no matter how jaded the world around us becomes the human heart was is and will forever be one driven by love 
the other user reviews hit the nail on the head about this movie and its stunning and ground breaking visual effects so i wont repeat what theyve already said so well the review provided by amazon misses an important point it claims that there was a disconnect between the main characters love of gismos and weaponry and his tree hugging attitude instead i would offer that this was obviously part of his character development not static confusion over time and with the experience of living in a native way he grew beyond the boy gizmo shoot it up mentality into a more holistic and truly powerful frame of mind i think this is a parody for how america will hopefully grow out of adolescence and war anti environmental mentality and into a more mature and interconnected mindset along those lines i liked the clear references to native or aboriginal belief systems and ways of being in the world of course its still entertainment and hollywood but if it plants even a seed of understanding that everything in nature is real alive sacred we may create a better future for our kids the fact that these themes were woven into a movie of this scale and ultimately popularity is also truly groundbreaking and a breath of fresh air kudos to cameron and the crew 
loved the movie in d this was the first movie when i bought my new samsung d tv bluray d player and am soooo glad i did
my family and i loved the movie it didnt even seem we were watching it for so long great movie for all the family 
excellent d would have been even better if they would have included the extended directors cut versions too bad so sad 
avatar was a great movie that i really enjoyed the movie is about a paraplegic ex marine named jake who gets picked to go to space to pick up the job of his twin brother who was helping a scientific company to mine the planet of pandora for a valued ore in order to get the ore thy have to invade the home of the navi a ten foot tall blue skinned native tribe who have been at war with the greedy scientific company since they have been forcing them out of their own land humans have been genetically grown in to these navi and they can switch their consciousnesses into their own avatar and explore the world of the navi after pressure to get te job done sooner than later jake tries to pursuade them to move their home before they get forced out jack starts to understand the secrets of pandora and the ways of the navi people which now makes his conscience torn between his new adopted world and the wheelchair bound one awaiting him when the psychic connection to his avatar is broken i will not say any more so that i dont ruin it for people who have not seen it yet the avatar blu ray will be released in a bare bones edition with no special features other than a dvd of the film on april with a special edition to be released in november of and a special d blu ray version of the movie to follow sometime next year when more d tvs and d blu ray players are in homes i personally do not like to have to purchase multiple copies of a movie or double or triple dip so to speak i do understand that james cameron and fox would rather get his film out asap than to wait a year or two to see if d blu ray takes off as for the special edition with minutes of extra footage that was not in the film well i fell in love with this version since its the one i saw in theatres according to the press release even though the blu ray disc itself will have no extras inside the blu ray dvd combo of the film will be a special code giving customers exclusive access to bonus materials and offers including a coupon towards the purchase of the planned special edition release in november fox and the earth day network will also plant one million trees in fifteen countries before the end of which fans will be able to adopt by registering at in addition there will be other digital initiatives including pandorama via a computers webcam users can immerse themselves into the world of pandora inserting themselves into different locations from the movie and interacting with the elements in each users can snap postcards and share amongst friends only at pandorapedia the official guide to the world of pandora and james camerons avatar fans enter a world beyond imagination with hundreds of facts on pandora that can be accessed online at immersive trailer the first ever interactive trailer allows fans to click on any part of the video to explore detail frame by frame and in context hot spots that will offer meticulous information on characters locations and more interactive desktop wallpaper instant access to all things avatar including newsfeeds videos social network updates and exclusive content that is updated automatically right on your desktopthe blu ray will feature p video a dts hd master audio soundtrack and as previously mentioned this release wont have any supplements update this avatar blu ray is one of the best looking and sounding blu rays ever the colors and sound will bring your p tv and sound system to life in its first day of release avatar is all ready the biggest selling blu ray im sure many other records will be broken as well for those of you you are upset because of the lack of special features your missing out on one of the finest blu rays and movies to date all for special features you might watch once or twice 
this movie is a true epic it is visually beautiful has awesome special effects and intense battle sequences in the year a corporation is mining pandora for unobtanium a small group of marines and soldiers are brought in as mercenaries jake sully is a paralyzed marine who volunteers for the avatar program an avatar is a body that is a mix of human and navi dna the navi are the blue species that inhabit pandora jake offers to earn their trust as an avatar so the military can get closer to what they need when jake meets neytiri and learn their ways of survival he soon wants to help them and stop the humans from destroying pandora i highly recommend avatar 
its a shame that when suposedly writing a review of a movie that people write about everything but the movie first off avatar is one hell of a movie it passes so fast you dont realize the true length of it the acting is top notch and yes some of it is done in a sort of cartoonish way the evil men are played somewhat over the top but that only adds to bring in the viewers emotions doesnt detract a bit the visual effects are as stunning as anything on blu ray the depth of field allows you to see far into the picture literally looking through your living room window so to speak into a magical land whos beauty is dazzling and was apparently drawn from many of the species found under our own seas only the new star trek is in the same bracket for this is a steal the dvd doesnt cost much to manufacture and include why complain about it the release of other sets had been anounced before this disc went on sale you want one of the other ones wait let those of us that just want the movie as is enjoy it without your whining i cant recommend this movie to highly if there were stars i would have given them to it
i ve seen some great films in the last few months e g the road paranormal activity but nothing i ve seen on a big or small screen prepared me for avatar this is not a movie it is an event my only request see it in d if you re like me you are a skeptic of d technology it s gimmicky it washes out the colors and blurs the picture but not avatar here the d is seamlessly interwoven with the film and every color and line remains crisp and clear brilliantly done the story is in certain respect fairly conventional disney s pochahontas on steroids in essence earthlings are planning to mine the planet pandora an edenic paradise albeit with a healthy dose of natural evil particularly in the form of some pretty frightening carnivores while we re on the topic of evil there s a plenty displayed in the earthlings destructive pillaging of pandora for the investors of a faceless corporation anyways the love an earthling discovers for an alien and her culture messes things up as the native american storyteller says i don t know if it happened this way or not but i know this story is true watching avatar i was impacted by how true it is the obsessive search for the valuable mineral on pandora reminded me of the destructive pillaging of northern alberta s oil sands the attempted relocation of pandora s native na vi people in order to begin the mining operation reminded me of the uk government s evil deportation of the native population of diego garcia to make way for a us military base and the whole military operation with a thinly veiled rationale recalled to mind the recent invasion of iraq as alan greenspan recently admitted it s about the oil stupid lest the viewer miss the allusion the film makes the link with iraq rather obvious with a reference to shock and awe in short this is an invaluable tract for our times and that s just the tip of the iceberg clever reference to titanic eh there are numerous themes to unpack militarism nationalism environmentalism racism speciesism and the complex interrelationship of science religion and the grinding pragmatism of entrepreneurial capitalism the best discussion since contact what is more there is some tantalizing theology thrown in is avatar offering a new version of the gaia hypothesis is jake sully a christ figure coming from above to become na vi and save the people and their world discuss there is also some intriguing metaphysics warning a modest spoiler ahead in the end the human jake sully opts to continue life in his alien avatar body while leaving his human body behind what sort of metaphysic of the human person is this either it suggests to me a substance dualism where the soul can be attached to various bodies or more likely a view where the human person consists of information which can simply be downloaded to various hard drives e g sully s human or avatar body this reminded me of frank tipler s wackily wonderful book the physics of immortality albeit on a much more modest scale in the end the runner up star in the film is the technology of the nd century it is great to see some of the ideas of future technology that cameron explored in his masterpiece aliens coming into fruition here but the star of the film is undoubtedly pandora itself the creatures are brilliant in their other worldly weirdness the jungle with its dense foliage and phosphorescent night time dreamscapes is mesmerizing the trees that make the general sherman sequoia look like a sapling are simply dazzling and the floating mountains well let me just say that if you thought wyoming s tetons are beautiful you really must check out cameron s visions after twelve years canadian director james cameron is still king of the world randalrauser com
purchased the blu ray from a place that starts with a t for im very cheap had to update the firmware on my br player in order to view the movie buuut once that was done the movie loaded fine and the picture quality looked great on my lcd tv watched it in the dark fell asleep halfway through i saw the movie in imax and well wasnt expecting imax in my living room but again the picture and sound qualityrates wayyyyy up there in comparison to some other br movies do i care that there werent any special features do i care that theres going to be a re release in the fall thatll include all of this and more will i purchase it again no i dont care about special features and no i dont care if its going to be released again in the fall yes i will purchase that copy as well the way i see it is this i had all of the pirates movies on dvd and when the br came out i got them as well well my wife got them for me as presents so what i never watch the dvds but have them in case i want to see how dull dvds are i dont think that fox has duped any of us and i dont know why some folks are quick to call foul its their movie annnnd that gives them the right to do what they like my copy will keep me happy until the fall 
im reviewing this product for what it is not what it isnt it isnt the special edition that fox has clearly announced will be arriving in the fall its ridiculous to give this release one star because it isnt that release this release is the new reference quality blu ray disc it contains a high definition transfer that was clearly done with love and care with the purpose of creating a home release with no visible flaws it is a success whatever you may think of the film as art or as commercial media as a technological achievement this disc cannot rate less than stars as the best looking blu ray ever released thats what was intended thats what was achieved thats what youll get if you buy it if thats not what you want dont buy it but dont badmouth it because it doesnt include content that doesnt even exist yet 
first of all its a great movie i can call it a parable because of all the strong naming such as the precious ore unobtainium that said i cannot comprehend how people are complaining about the theatrical release at such a low price its the cost of two movie tickets for petes sake you want to wait till november to get the extended edition and not be able to see the movie now at home are you waiting till christmas for some new restaurant to open and are avoiding any other place until then because you dont want to waste your money its a wonderfully entertaining movie it will have both bluray as well as dvd copies in the package making the bluray version as cheap as the bluray version of home alone and you complain get the movie when the extended version comes out give the old one to your kids or your friends or just use it as a deluxe and conversation starting drink coaster remember that the movie was about people who were not satisfied with what they had and wanted the more cost effective ore under the sacred tree so try to be a little less selfish and just enjoy the movie 
acclaimed filmmaker james cameron once again made cinematic history with the breathtaking science fiction blockbuster avatar in the distant future a handicapped ex marine named jake scully sam worthington accepts a job to aid a human colony in their mining venture in the jungle planet of pandora where its inhabitants known as the navi are strongly against the destruction to their home using an alien hybrid called an avatar he makes contact with the navi and becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home avatar is an extraordinary and visually groundbreaking film spectacle that ranks as one of the most imaginative sci fi movies in cinema history thought the story may be a somewhat clich eacute d with obvious stereotypes the film is nevertheless entertaining and embracing cameron and his technical crew have spent many years developing the technology to create this sci fi world and its inhabitants avatar represents an impressive leap in special effects and d technology the cast also stars zoe saldana stephen lang michelle rodriguez giovanni ribisi and sigourney weaver avatar extended collection edition is truly a must have for sci fi fans and home video enthusiasts the award winning blockbuster is presented in widescreen format the disc blu ray includes the original theatrical version the special edition re release and the hour extended cut the picture quality is certainly reference quality with such eye popping detail and vivid colors the dts hd master audio delivers a first rate home theater experience the extended collection edition also includes over minutes of deleted scenes the in depth documentary capturing avatar behind the scenes featurettes that further explores the films production screen testes high definition picture galleries and theatrical trailers overall avatar extended collection edition scores an a 
yo the movie is very good i enjoyed the performances and action sequences and thought james cameron did a very good job from his year hiatus as a director the visuals are stunning this might be why the movie is so great the story is good and detailed but not as much as terminator and titanic still this movie does remind you of terminator with all the robots and futuristic air crafts go get this if you dont really care about extra features most of the time i never watch all the extra stuff just give me the movie so i can watch it and thats it 
the blu ray disk has superb quality of picture and sound despite being d rather than d because the film was done to provide a feeling of depth it looks great no lets get to all this noise about it not having extra footage or special features what nonsense would you rather be enjoying the movie until the extended version is released or do you just want to spend your time trimming your toe nails as for special features on movies such as lord of the rings ive looked at the special features only once when available i will probably do the same for avatar but ill watch the movie many times for lesser movies i never even look at the special features this release has one fantastic thing that you cannot find on any other fox bd or dvd no advertising coming to theaters or coming to dvd priceless i hate to pay for something and then be forced to watch commercials 
avatar is a tough movie to review and perhaps even tougher to put a score on on one hand it is technically or technologically if you will one of the most stunning game changing movies youll see it makes you feel what audiences seeing the original king kong must have felt a sense of what was possible in movies that you never knew before on the other hand the story it tells is pedestrian and predictable in many ways remember how james camerons titanic took a lot of heat for having a poor script avatar is much the same while its romantic scenes arent as painful as the ones george lucas penned for natalie portman and hayden christensen in the latest star wars epics they arent exactly convincing either if the movie were measured purely by storytelling acting and all the conventional items we usually judge movies by it would be a solid out of if we were to judge it purely on technical merit its perhaps a out of and while im thinking of it let me say right here and now that this movie must must must be seen in d in most movies even with todays current excellent technology d is a nice add on its integral to the enjoyment of avatar so get out there and see it in a theater avatar is set about years in the future earth has apparently become a bit of a desert and so mankind or at least a corporation eerily similar to halliburton and a military eerily similar to the one liberals apparently think dick cheney would run has invaded the planet of pandora where a rare mineral named unobtanium exists in abundance problem is the humanoid species on the top of the food chain there the navi live in a giant wondrous tree that is right on top of the biggest deposit of unobtanium in the best tradition of all movies where the clumsy conniving greedy and bloodthirsty white men yearn to trample over the differently colored close to the earth natives in order to earn money avatar draws no ethically gray areas the navi are the good guys and the military corporate interests are bad in the middle is a tiny group of scientists who yearn to study and learn from the navi and pandora and to perhaps obtain a sort of peace between the two species a diplomatic solution as someone says the scientists led by sigourney weaver in a strange tone deaf performance are interested in building schools learning the language and seemingly dont understand that the companys patience is at an end why build a school if it doesnt result in a pile of unobtanium into the mix we throw a paralyzed soldier whose brother was one of weavers team he had been about to have an avatar grown from him when he was killed so his brother sam worthington is talked into taking over the avatar and using it to befriend and spy on the navi whats an avatar its basically an empty navi that has been created by blending dna from the navi with the dna of the specific human destined to use the avatar once the avatar is fully grown the human can inhabit it by having his consciousness transferred to it worthington agrees to do this when his colonel stephen lang in a gloriously over the top performance promises that his legs will be repaired if he can deliver good intelligence on the navi you might guess that when worthington enters the foot tall blue but able bodied avatar he becomes hooked not only on having mobility again but is enchanted by the lovely planet and his lovely female guide and teacher zoe saldana conflict ensues when the information he has gathered is used against the navi whom he now loves and wishes to protect this mundane story full of clich eacute s that are almost laughable in their earnestness becomes almost secondary to the experience that is pandora it is a beautiful lush planet filled with unusual plants and animals creatures that show remarkable imagination from cameron and crew we are shown one swooping vista after another that takes our breath away there are flying creatures something like dragons that worthington and the other navi fly and we truly get a sense of flying making stuff like the flying scenes in harry potter look amateurish the depth of the d is like nothing youve seen before layer after layer of jungle mountains and people the movie is gorgeous in a way that ive never experienced im a somewhat jaded moviegoer and my year old son has a nd career being jaded but we were both blown away by how cool this movie is ive barely touched on who wondrous this film is in so many ways i dont think i really have the vocabulary to describe how happy i was to be seeing it its a longish film minutes but i did not want it to be over i wanted to see some more of pandora and the movie was also greatly assisted by a grounded and capable performance by sam worthington who also made terminator salvation watchable hes a rugged manly actor but his performance is self effacing and open to the wonder that is pandora we experience it mostly through his eyes and his reactions inform our understanding i think this guy now needs a more down to earth non sci fi film to really show us what hes got cameron is a great director in many ways while his scripts are often a bit uninspired he knows how to construct a story it takes a long time for avatar to come to its real action scenes but cameron knows that if hes built everything up correctly made us care about the right people understand the stakes and simply feel the tension then finally getting the payoff makes things work so much better the battle scenes are pretty impressive and worth the wait in the end although i think there are some significant flaws some sketchy performances and some clumsy writing i must give the film top marks because so many things arent just right they are revelatory take your friends and family and experience avatar 
this review will be in two parts part one the blu ray and part two the actual movie i will avoid a detailed plot synopsis or detailed spoilers part one the blu ray packageyes as stated before this blu ray contains nothing but the movie aside from the dvd version on a separate disk there are no extras commentaries making of nothing i think the price is sorta high for that i also think they should have just packaged the blu ray and charged less at one store for example i saw the dvd version for and this version with both disks for having said that i have to say that this movie is a joy on blu ray if you saw it in d as i did liked it and thought you would not like it in d please think again i was very pleased with the transition the color and sound track were just outstanding all it really looks good and sounds good so good that my wife and i became completely immersed again now the question is should you wait for the extras if you intend to buy this that depends most of the time i dont look at that stuff so for me this was ok although i still think the blu ray should have been packaged alone at the same price as the dvd if you must have all the extras then you should wait for the other releases and rent this part two the movieok yes this story has been told before in many other books movies etc but it still works here if youre going to get all hung up because the military is portrayed as less than complimentary or one dimensional or because of the supposed politics nature good corporations bad then frankly you wont enjoy this after all its a movie not real life the military are mercenaries and not us soldiers and a little bit of earth nature awareness or sympathy for indigenous people wouldnt hurt us in my opinion im a vet myself so i have an opinion i served with many people who considered anyone not us to be wogs or monkeys its a detachment that you learn to one degree or another if you are lucky you get over it if not maybe you join the mercs i dont know the world building that becomes clear in this film is amazing the common look of the animals most have two pair of legs or arms up front and one in back and the variety of plant life look like someone put a lot of thought into designing this world the flying animals are so realistic the scene where a chopper follows a waterfall down is very real flights of birds that from a distance look like something from african nature films i find that about minutes into the film im totally immersed in it this is the sign of a good movie for me its kicked my suspension of disbelief into high gear the plot pretty much follows the traditional heros journey as described by joseph campbell starting with the call to adventure or departure here this is jake leaving earth and later leaving and his crippled body when he spends his night in the forest in his avatar the other elements of the heros journey we see are the initiation and road of trials learning the ways of the navi and the subsequent war the return with a boon in this case finding what is important to oneself your purpose and some redemption how can you go wrong with a story like that its practically baked into our very nature it resonates and vibrates though us add a believable visual world that sucks you in really good actors and you have a terrific entertainment piece very well done at my age i look for films like this to hit me emotionally and make me feel like im years old again this film hit that chord on many levels for me the beauty of the primitive strange jungle especially at nightthe sky with a large planet and other moons in itsailing the air over pandora feeling the bond with my ikranthe visual horror as a pali runs from the battle injured and on fireall emotional responses to very good film making for me this hit all the numbers and took years off my age for a few hours thanks james cameron in summary id recommend this movie to anyone with a healthy suspension of disbelief and a love of high adventure or space opera im giving it stars id give it if i could i own it ill watch it multiple times 
if your a huge sci fi fan then this movie is a must if you dont care alot for cg like me then this movie probably will turn the table around for you like me becuase its the best most life like cg to date and i mean it looks great the plot is great acting is supurb its a long movie but dosent feel so becuase your so drawn into it you dont even notice get this movie its the best movie i think of all of and to date 
you can be angry this version doesnt have d or additional features or extras and shout at the studios for exploiting the market but i wouldnt tell people not to buy it because avatar is the single best looking blu ray currently available and this is what cameron said you would be getting from this blu ray nothing but the movie looking the best it can possibly look because there are no extras what you are paying for and hopefully gladly is a chance to buy this film for home viewing while it is still in the theaters and it is spectacular you arent getting the cheap dumbed down product some well intentioned people are warning against this is a premium quality disc this is your chance to purchase the theatrical version later on you will have the chance to buy the extended edition and a d version both of these will no doubt cost more than this version not many people will be able to take advantage of d so it not being in d right now is fairly irrelevant i love extras but the truth be told most of the time i only need the movie the extras all too often go unwatched if you want a showpiece blu ray to replace or add to your roster of baraka or fifth element or dark knight avatar will make your hd system sparkle with life you havent seen to date 
i was hesitant to watch this movie for some reason but decided to rent it i am really happy i did i really liked the movie and loved all the vivid colors my favorite is the connection with the dragons i also really liked when the lead actor caught a ride on the dragon that no one else could capture i dont usually watch movies twice but i may just watch this one again 
the special effects are amazing the d is incredible the color is terrific i liked the message you are completely immersed in the world of the story dont even think of seeing it without the d or of waiting to see it on dvd it wont be the same my only caveat is that they could have shortened the climactic battle scene overall a movie that changes the future of movies 
as always im leaving a review of a specific version because of amazons odd policy of lumping them all together i am delighted with this version the extended version was great just enough additional material to improve it not so much to overload you and on the extra features discs there is more material than you could shake a remote control at actually if it had been me i would have put some of the deleted scenes in the movie but thats just opinion im not sure a lot of people appreciate how influential this movie will be in the future of movie making the technological advances here are really monumental even given that cameron did not take his eyes off the story which works very well i did read a bad review that said that the movie was leftist propaganda and it was a remake ofdances with wolves th anniversary edition blu ray the first is correct as it is well recorded history that thomas jefferson often had his slaves strip mining his land at monticello and john adams advocated the eradication of indigenous peoples btw for those of you who are too literal im being very broadly sarcastic here as to the second im pretty sure they jumping off the cliff scene came frompredator blu ray or wait wasnt it inbutch cassidy and the sundance kid two disc collectors edition first no wait it first was intarzan of the apeswith elmo lincoln in thats it its a frame for frame remake of the film again broad sarcasm here i have to say that because people who make claims like the above have very low levels of humor detection i really recommend this edition i have not even had the time to go through all the extra features 
i waited for this one for almost a year after i saw avatar in theaters i passed up the first release and am glad i did avatar is a movie that really deserves to be seen in theaters nothing else really does it justice but as far as blu ray releases go this is one of the best ive bought the visuals are stunning as is the sound and the special features are great one of the highlights for me is the scene deconstruction where you can watch about half of the scenes in the movie along with the original motion capture performance its pretty cool to see how accurately the actors performances were portrayed by the cgi characters as far as the extended cut goes i didnt really care for it the extra minutes werent really necessary for the film although they did add a little bit they really just made the movie seem longer but not better it took away from the pacing of the film which i think the theatrical release got perfectly otherwise this is an excellent release 
im primarily interested in the storyline differences between special sets and their theatrical counterparts so here are the differences between the two note spoilers follow the extended collectors edition runs minutes seconds longer than the theatrical cut and listed below are the major differences the opening scene is different and starts with jake in a wheelchair on earth in a blade runner esque earth city the scene moves to scenes of jake in his apartment then taking liquid shots in a bar jakes narration of i told myself i can pass any test a man can pass and they can fix the spinal if you got the money but not on vet benefits not in this economy are inserted during this new opening scene jake beats up a bar patron who is mistreating a woman and then jake and wheelchair are unceremoniously thrown outside by bouncers into an alley while in the alley jake meets the two rda representatives who bring him news of his brothers untimely death then the movie cuts back to the original theatrical cut where jake sees his brothers body cremated then awakes in space during jakes initial flyover of pandora in his avatar they witness a herd of sturmbeasts buffalo like creatures after seeing the sturmbeasts grace jake and norm stop by graces old english school for the navi the school is now closed abandoned and some walls are riddled with bullet holes norm finds a dr seuss book the lorax on the ground this scene explains how neytiri knew english so well and certainly gives some further backstory into grace augustines character interestingly the lorax can be seen as a metaphor for the pandoran story recall that the seemingly simple seussian book is actually a lesson on the plight of the environment and industrialization we see some other different pandoran flora and fauna particularly with scenes of the luminescent forest floor jakes first dinner with neytiri is longer and extended and its here that she tells him her full name when jake grace and norm first visit the hallelujah mountains on the way to the remote uplink station grace explains in a jake voiceover that the mountains are levitated via the meissner effect because unobtanium is a superconductor theres a pretty spectacular cgi shot as the characters look around in awe at the suspended mountains pictures of grace and navi children at her previously functioning school dr augustine tells jake that she previously taught neytiri and her sister sylwanin however one day sylwanin and some hunters destroyed an rda bulldozer and rda secops troopers killed them at the school which explains why the school walls were previously seen pockmarked with bullet holes sturmbeast hunting scene after jake tames a banshee after jake successfully kills a sturmbeast with an arrow he and neytiri chortle a heck yeah and whoop jake and neytiris love scene comprises them linking braids together some kissing nothing explicit tsutey leads a war party that destroys the rdas autonomous bulldozers as well as the rda secops squad that was guarding them corporal wainfleet leads the search party that uncovers the evidence via real time helmet cam footage not sure why they cut this scene from the theatrical cut as it persuades selfridge to attack the home tree attack of hammerhead titanotheres on rda forces has been extended slightly additional scenes of amp suits getting destroyed fight between colonel quaritch in amp suit and neytiri on thanator slightly longer tsuteys death scene in the theatrical cut he falls off the rda shuttles aft ramp to his death in the collectors edition he falls to the forest floor mortally wounded he passes on leadership to jake and asks jake to ceremonially kill him e g hara kiri so that jake will be the last shadow that tsu tey sees jake does so i preferred the original tsutey death scene which was more dramatic jake had afterall already become the de facto clan leader by that point in the movie so further formal transfer by tsutey a minor character seemed unnecessary 
i must be the last person on earth to see this movie after seeing it i totally understand why it is the highest grossing film in history its a spectacular tour de force with breathtaking special effects and a story that resonates the acting in films like this is usually rote at best but the two lead actors really made you believe their bond really i could go on about the story but im sure anybody reading this has already seen this fantastic movie all im left to say is is this guy james cameron great or what 
i have been waiting for this movie since before titanic cameron has not disappointed me at all this movie is best enjoyed on the weekend afternoon where you can sit back relax and let yourself fall in love with the world of pandora and her people the d edition is as enjoyable as the imax d edition shown in theaters as it lets you see the plot and storyline clearly without the special effects stealing the show though it lacks special features on the original release edition the movie itself makes up for it with sheer fun and emotional gravitas 
this is an excellent movie it has sci fi action spirituality love good guy bad guy awesome
just watched the extended collectors edition on my samsung bd c worked fine one tiny little oddity at three points during the film the pause menu graphic popped up on its own scene label timeline etc and the movie kept playing menu went away after a couple of seconds this behavior happened consistently at the same places i tested it after finishing the movie took a moment to upgrade the players software problem vanished as far as the collection itself wonderful for all the reasons many of the other reviewers have noted i was one of the people who passed on the original blu ray release because i had read this one was in the works well worth the wait 
i just saw avatar yesterday i have to say it definately impressed me before i saw it i knew that it had a lot of computer animation in it and part of me was saying that this is gonna be a crappy attempt to make that next generation movie because everything would look fake the other part of me was saying that this was also the most expensive movie ever made and theres a reason why so not being able to decide what i thought it would be like i watched it it blew me away at how detailed and vibrant the animation was the avatars even had similar facial features to that of their human controlling them the voices and sounds of the people and the jungle were life like i couldnt believe that everything would look so real this shows me where all the money went another thing that i really liked was the themes of the movie the humans were actually the bad guys in this one they came to the plantet pandora to mine unobtanium which is funny because it suggests that it is unobtainable it sells for million a kilo or something and all they are trying to do it get as much as they can the navi however see life through the eyes of nature every plant and animal on pandora is connected and so are everyone of the navi people they live in harmony and it is amazing how it hints at true spirituality this theme is that money should not be the center of your life and that spiritual things are much more sustaining another theme i liked was that everyone of the navi could plug into each other animals and trees just like plugging a cord into a computer and syncing it suggests that there is one mind and that all are connected no matter how different this is very similar to some religions today and i found it very interesting that they combined spirituality into an action movie on another planet definately watch this movie it is probably the best movie ive ever seen the graphics and sound quality is superb and would be twice as good on blu ray with surround sound but let me warn you the version that is out now on dvd is only the movie in november or december of this year a compete edition will come out that will have all the bonus features and what not wait until then if you can to buy it but dont wait until then to watch it rent it or if youve got deep pockets buy it now and then buy the second edition later id recommend this movie to anyone and everyone hardly any blood a few obsenities and a lot of good suspense not to mention the ties with nature and god stars all the way 
yes i have plenty of disappointed customers who wanted d special features extended cuts etc but as it has been playing in the store since last week it sells itself no need to rehash the film or specs i think i have read different outlines here of it all just checking the outcome testing on a variety of plasma and lcd displays i was very pleased with how the presentation has come across if the lcd panels are not tweaked to a certain extent the navi can appear almost fake it is so clear but the benchmark scenes throughout the film color and fill the displays in every way imaginable i enjoyed the fact that there were no trailers or ads to fill either disc there is only one insert for the online registration of fun sites and activities the sound is mixed to a fulfillment level that exceeded how i thought it would be the animal jungle sounds fill every channel perfectly i pause checked a hundred different spots and saw nothing to pick apart i even tried paused the listed goofs on various sites and i could not find several of them now the menu itself plays nice with moving scenes and pics in hd the only manipulation is for bookmarks otherwise as has been rehashed a million times nothing else to review a standard two disc bd case with each disc on their respective side no hinges i did not care to ding this set for what is not there just for how excellent the presentation is and value for getting two items

despite its success many regard it as unoriginal and simply a blend of several stories we already know while thats true in some ways it doesnt mean that it isnt groundbreaking or spectacular in its own right the trailers didnt impress me at all and i dismissed the hype from people who had seen the movie in theaters when avatar earned nine oscar nominations winning three and the blu ray was released it was finally time to see what all the fuss was about i truly expected to be disappointed but i was completely wrong within seconds the movie had me in its grasp we see an interior shot of the ship and meet jake sully sam worthington the main protagonist cameron chooses to use sully as a narrator and it works effectively the opening shot of the ship looks impressive and gives an idea of the sheer scale of the movie a minute later a shot of pandora orbiting a gas giant increases the impression of size the first minutes takes time to establish the setting we meet the main human characters and discover some of their background and the purpose of their mission sully is an ex marine who despite having lost the use of his legs is able to use the expensive avatar intended for his dead brother this shows us that the mining company in the story is cynical and only concerned about the bottom line money sully has no experience with the avatar and no training in the background of the native navi language hes portrayed as savvy confident and disrespectful and we are supposed to like him immediately after a speech that wouldnt have been out of place in full metal jacket we learn that pandora is a dangerous and inhospitable moon and that many will not survive their tour of duty the initial setup might drag for some but it held my interest the exposition is clumsy but it really doesnt matter this is a feast for the eyes and ears and you will enjoy it more if you dont stop to analyze it after minutes everything changes when sully as part of an exploration team is sent on a mission outside the training complex in his avatar body the initial shot of the surface is breathtaking full of detail and color in fact some of the colors seem totally new to science sullys inexperience shows and he is separated from the team by the native animals thats when the story really begins as we encounter a navi woman in the form of neytiri zoe saldana sullys eventual love interest the hour following sullys first trip to the surface is the most original and interesting part of the movie we are shown pandora and the navi way of life in an extended training sequence as the tribe decides to study sully the creatures and plants he encounters are quite different from things we have seen before the jungle which they inhabit also has unique features just look at some of the night scenes for example i dont want to ruin the story by revealing too much for the few people who havent seen avatar so lets concentrate on the themes as the world is introduced to us we start to shift focus instead of viewing it as something to be exploited for its minerals it becomes a precious thing of beauty the inhabitants want nothing more than to live and be left alone its an effective sequence and most viewers will empathize with the plight of the navi and start to side with them just as our protagonist does as i have indicated the script isnt the most important reason to watch avatar some of the dialogue is silly and you are clearly told which characters you are supposed to like or dislike but that doesnt mean its totally without depth and you will see a few of the characters develop and change sully is an obvious example as is grace sigourney weaver but take a closer look at tsutey laz alonso his character interested me and i enjoyed seeing his character gradually change throughout the story i would have liked to have seen him involved even more once we are fully invested in the navi way of life the events which follow have more meaning the actions of the military seem like abominations there are obvious parallels to the way in which the us military is viewed by some the use of unobtainium is an obvious reference to oil in todays world the home tree may even be viewed as the twin towers and the navi represent a race that was exploited on our own world cameron isnt afraid to use our modern prejudices to draw us in deeper there is a strong green message as well and it just seems wrong to destroy the beauty and harm the native population im a big fan of orson scott cards ender wiggin series and it was interesting to see his theme of everything in the world being connected from speaker of the dead used in avatar it was effective because it heightened the feeling that this world and its people should not be exploited the final minutes switches to full hollywood mode we see non stop action explosions inspirational speeches death heroic acts unlikely outcomes and miraculous escapes its full of clich eacute but i found that i didnt actually mind the reason was that the first half of the story made me care about these characters i was fully invested one thing i realized after taking everything in was that avatar was unique in one very important way im a fan of science fiction in general and love movies such as blade runner and dune when i watch those movies or star wars i know that they are set in different realities and sometimes on different worlds but part of me always thinks that its just earth it may feature a desert setting or use an unusual location but its still something i know avatar made me feel like i stepped out onto a completely new world when i saw where and how the navi lived i was really seeing it for the first time the creatures the fauna and the colors were unique it almost felt like i was a part of the story the overall pacing was excellent once you see pandoras surface for the first time youll be hooked this experience doesnt seem to last over two and a half hours and you will probably wish for more when it ends dont despair there is now an extended cut available with an additional minutes and extensive special features as well as the likelihood of two sequels over the next few years the popularity of avatar almost guarantees that we will be seeing a lot more of pandora in the future i for one cant wait avatar is influenced by so many movies that it would be prohibitive to list them all dances with wolves and the matrix are certainly near the top of the list video quality avatar looks better than any movie i have ever seen with the exception of some fully animated titles although the majority was created on a computer rather than filmed with a camera it seems real and the detail is exceptional the colors that we know are accurate while the newly invented surroundings and inhabitants appear consistent with the less familiar colors the image is so good that it adds to the feeling that you are stepping out onto an unknown world even the menu and subtitles look impressive i really cant imagine a better quality presentation in the future audio quality the sound quality matches the picture quality there is so much detail that its a completely immersive experience you can hear creatures all around you on the moons surface the latter action sequences carry impressive weight and the explosions seem real the score matches the mood of the movie well and builds during important sequences in a similar fashion to lord of the rings i didnt have to strain to hear any dialogue its hard to fault anything in the presentation as a whole this is why blu ray exists 
this is the best set for any avatar fan not only does it have all three versions of the movie but it also has a lot of special features as for the extended cut it is incredible the added footage adds so much detail and background that was missing from the original version i could not wait to purchase it when it first came out so i bought the bare bone version then i sold it when i saw this was coming out so glad i did because this is the version to have whether you are a die hard avatar fan or just a casual fan this is the set to buy 
 note review contains spoilers omg omg what a fantastic film i saw avatar in d imax the first day it came out and i still bought this dvd i completely ignored everyone who said wait for the version coming out in november i just couldnt wait that long to see it at home and own my own piece of blue magic i can unequivocally say that avatar was the best movie i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of movies hands down five stars hell id give it six stars i know there was a lot of hype behind this film given the astronomical amount of money that james cameron poured into it but seriously for once the movie matched all the hype avatar was phenomenal first the cinematography was amazing viewing the film in d was like being a immersed into the landscape of pandora a part of its lush forests with multi hued fantastic flora and fauna of all kinds it was uniquely magnificent and i was transported into that world from the very first glimpse of the planet the navi were fascinating as a species both to look at in terms of their cat like beauty and grace to their way of life and deeply rooted metaphysical relationship with their planet i loved zoe saldanas character neytiri she was so fierce and beautiful and feminine all in one package what a fantastic character such a strong female heroine neytiri was real and gritty and more human than some of her human counterparts in recent movies she was so entrenched in her feelings you could hear her raw emotion when she cried after her father died or when jake revealed his betrayal zoe saldana delivered a spectacular performance worthy of recognition despite only seeing her in cgid navi form her ability to deliver that kind of gut performance goes beyond anything ive ever seen i had to admit i had some misgivings because i believed going in to see avatar that there was going to be an unhappy ending after all how does a human possessing the body of a navi via a machine get to live happily ever after the human controller must survive for the navi avatar to live but i loved the way that james cameron resolved this for me not to give away too much but pandoras magic the spirit of eywa just made it come together so naturally when jake sully assumes the consciousness of his avatar for good that i was spellbound i loved sam worthingtons character jake sully i was rooting for him the whole time and i really wanted neytiri to fall for him of course she had to be the daughter of the clan leader and seer that was the only part that was a little predictable but you always have to have an untouchable princess in these types of stories worked for me when jake sully shows up with the leonopteryx as the sixth toruk makto i felt my heart jump for him that was just awesome in a lot of ways the film itself became a medium for me to experience his characters first interaction with pandora and the navi almost as if it were the avatar and i its human connection hows that for a mind twister the conflict battle scenes were spectacular i felt so emotionally connected to the navi that i found myself gripping the arms of my seat when their hometree was destroyed and when they were attacked by the sky people sigourney weaver was as awesome as she was in alien although not in the lead role this time but she is just made for these types of movies ive always been a huge fan of hers and all the alien films i was connected to this movie the whole time feeling goosebumps and a sense of breathlessness many times throughout its minute run time at the end when neytiri jumps into the shack and saves the human jake that scene was so emotionally touching you just felt that it didnt matter what species they were she loved him and he her when they said i see you to each other i felt their love in my toes and that is an emotional connection folks this film took me away from a very mundane reality to a fantastic world that i just didnt want to leave i would watch avatar again in a heartbeat one of the things that makes a movie great is its ability to draw in its viewers and to make them connect emotionally visually and aurally with its message avatar accomplished that and more it was a movie that i didnt want to end i walked out of the movie theater with a fist pump and a huge grin completely satisfied which is more than i can say for many many other films you will experience the gambit of human emotions through the film and for those critics whove said that it has no real plot or story well theyre the ones without imagination avatar is not just a fantasy or sci fi film its a love story with a ton of action and some pretty neat concepts like all life on pandora being connected like the synapses of the human brain this film has no equal i bought this dvd even without the special features and i will probably buy the one with all the bells and whistles stars check out my profile info for my website with pics and more avatar reviews 
i bought this not expecting too much since it is a blu ray dvd combo pack and i wasnt disappointed there are no special features on either disc that being said its still a great movie and since im the only one in my family that has a blu ray player it was nice giving them the dvd its also a really swell price for what you get if your the type of person that likes having all the special features and behind the scenes stuff dont get this if you want just the movie at a decent price then this is your best offer i will add one more caution if you dont mind being patient ive heard rumors of this movie being rereleased this year with new footage so if you dont mind waiting id wait for that 
this was an excellent film if you watch it only for the splendor of it all then it will still be worth watching and owning 
a stunningly deep and rich movie blu ray video is beautiful as is the dts hd sound 
its eighteen bucks on blu ray what looks so astounding so far beyond anything ive watched at home than i am completely happy getting it now so at the end of the year ill get the d version too heres my story about two months ago i was in an electronics store and they seem to use nothing but avatar scenes to showcase their plus inch tvs obviously scenes were released for just this purpose i noticed that it seemed to have much more detail and saturation than in the theatre in which both dimax or reald seemed to push the source paste its prime i also know that shops love to mess up the contrast saturation and sharpness to win you over with shock and awe what am i watching here earth wind and fur but i sensed then in the store that when the blu ray came out on the film that it would more satisfying to see at home i use a front projector by sanyo and a pull down inch screen movie over screen goes up no ugly tv dominating any room so i watched avatar tonight and it completely blew me away i felt that i finally saw what cameron had really intended glorious saturation vivid endless surface details well ya just gotta come over and check it out since i caught panasonics d tv demo in town about three weeks ago that will trounce the d in theatres also in terms of perfection and clarity ok thats my story the sharpness of avatar in the theatres compared to blu ray at home on hopefully for you at least a inch screen well its like comparing dvd to blu ray its thrilling you can see raindrops on characters shoulders so clearly the skin on the reptiles is so much more detailed you feel like this is what cameron really intended for you to see in terms of richness and detal you guys remember how the film used rich blue and red from firelight battles nightime scenes glowing plantlife wait till you see this at home so i say go 
this was an awesome adventure one of the best movies ever i would and do reccomdend that you see this one at least once it is not filled with bloody violence or r rated material of any sort it is entertainment at its finest i hope that hollywood gets the hint and starts making more of these types of movies rather than the horror gruesome demonic violent sexual movies that have been forthcoming from that venue i for one simply enjoyed the mystic the possibilities of finding new subjects to explore and new dimentions to illuminate avatar is truly a classic one i hope will have a sequel 
i got this as soon as i found it available on the net it will not be available commercially for some time and that of course means the price is way to high for most viewers i was willing to be taken for a ride but if you do not just have to have it now i would recommend waiting until it is available everywhere the video quality is fantastic i have a samsung d setup and the movie was just beautiful to watch not quite the same as imax but very close size of screen being the only difference that i could see the d is to my eyes exactly as good as the imax on screen version i am a huge fan of the movie but believe me i would tell you if the video quality was not great i would not hesitate to do the purchase again even considering the huge rip off in price at this time but advise others to consider if you really have to have it right now or can wait awhile great movie almost unbelievable video transfer quality and a price that is just not right hope this helps 
to mr cameron having been a student of filmaking for many years now as well as a writer of science fiction i offer you two different perspectives on your collectors edition of avatar on one level i thought the extended version was excellent where the few added minutes helped to accentuate the film on another level i felt you should have taken more time to release this version in order to complete and add to the overall film the minutes of source fragment material that were a joy to view you see many of those scenes placed greater emphasis on the bond jake scully had made with the naavi thereby making his leadership with their battle against the humans at the end of the story that much more credible heck if i can sit and watch the hour directors cut of john woos mighty film red cliff in one viewing then sitting and watching a hour viewing of avatar would be like being in heaven good day 
awesome a great movie that should have been given top awards great story line that follows the history of the spaniards italians and english in their quest to colonize different parts of our world this off world adaptation of our treatment of indigenous natives by the leaders of nations or large companies is well written and the film technology is the best in years the cg and live film meld flawlessly and the flow and action keep you in the film start to finish best in d 
i loved this movie its an emotional roller coaster ride that does not disappoint those who found a story lacking in this movie are puzzling great story of love honor and mans inhumanity greed and disregard for life and the environment very uplifting ending left me feeling emotionally satisfied the blu ray quality was astounding and breathtaking highly recommended for sci fi fans action adventure fans and romantics of all ages 
people bashed it cause it was a big budget film and the focus of the previews and reviews were on the special effects however this is one of the best sci fi movies ever made filled with hidden messages and real implications for our future if you refuse to see it because it was a highly publicized blockbuster than you are an idiot 
this movie looks fantastic in d with our led vizio d set that we obtained via amazon it looks even better at times than it did at the d movie theater weve been going to d movies for a very long time way before it became in vogue we would religiously go to d movies long ago seeing them on the big imax screen at navy pier in chicago we have a good number of d movies on dvd and this one is one of the very best in terms of visual magnificence this movie is the best it shows how other planets can have a diversity of life that is equally spectacular and beautiful it reveals how intelligent beings can be very appreciative of mother nature and of the whole of life while unintelligent beings can act like mechanical automatons indifferent callous and uncaring the movie shows us the absurdity of blindly following others the navi reminded me a lot of our indigenous native americans this is an insightful compassionate movie for all ages 
this movies was the greatest i have seen in a long time every aspect about it is cool from the action to the romance to the drama to the digital effect to sooo much more brilliantly directed too i keep hearing about this first release not having all the features and my motto me ne frego or i dont give a damn this is a terrific movie one for the ages and at the price is fine by me also really do you really want to wait for some bonus features that your gonna watch one or twice get this edition then when the third edition comes out grab that dont even bother with it this is the movie that was in theaters what won crowds over globaly get it you wont regret it 
why so much complaining most people already know another version is coming out you could only call it double dipping if the studio didnt tell you about it so wait for the other release and quit bashing this version a lot of people dont care about bonus features directors cuts commentaries and all the other stuff i can barely find time to watch the movie itself lets face it no matter what version you end up getting nothing will compare to the imax or d you saw in the theater but even for d the quality is awesome the picture literallyjumps off the screen so yes they did use a lot of data on this disc and although d for home is promising who wants to replace all their gear again i sure the heck dont youre talking receiver blu ray player display notto mention the d glasses ouch for a family by the way this is no unique business model everything sold follows thesame principle how do you make more sales make it better or different how about that new computer a month later a better faster cheaperone will be out there how many times has your favorite cd been released the list goes on and on i say enjoy this film now life is short more important things to worry aboutthan when the other version is coming out 
jake sully a war veteran who gets called to the depths of space to pick up the job of his slain twin brother for the scientific arm of a megacorporation looking to mine the planet of pandora for a valued ore unfortunately the biggest deposit of the prized substance lies underneath the home of the navi a ten foot tall blue skinned native tribe who have been at war with the security arm of the company lead by col miles quaritch because of the planets hostile atmosphere humans have genetically grown half alien half human bodies which they can jack their consciousnesses into and explore the world in this movie was an epic a must see especially in imax great story and orchestrated like a masterpiece mouth dropping cinematics and great acting the creativity put into this world is fabulous and you really do feel like youre there when you put on those dorky d glasses its got everything you need in a movie fantasy science adventure war and battle a dash of comedy and some unexpected romance all in such a beautiful atmosphere one to add to a collection 
this will go down in the tippa t history as one of the best movies ive ever seen it was just beautiful half way through the movie i saw this with my mom after a failed attempt to see this in d which wasnt even necessary it was that great i texted her this exact message this is lotr matrix good visually striking has politics philosophy linguistics sociology and is moving my type of movie i knew it woud be good but it was better than i expected definite enthusiastic yes note to fully enjoy this movie as with all other movies dont see it with high or any expectations then it will woo you 
it is no wonder that this movie broke all box office records it provided everything that an audience seeks adventure escapism love morality and a sense of wonder i have seen it three times now and it still keeps my attention that is saying something i hope that they eventually decide to make a sequel to this fascinating movie 
cameron as done it again not only does the movie entertain it brings a message to the human race about being one with your surroundings truly one of the greats 
my wife and i saw this opening weekend and we both loved it i am tempted to suggest this should get stars because i expect more from james as far as story goes but then i think about the complete and awesome development of the world and animals and im back up to stars and now for my guide on how to properly view avatar go see it in d it is worth the extra money to upgrade the experience it would still be good in d but the d is done at a new level for d ive seen a number of d movies and nothing has compared to this finally someone has made a good worthwhile reason to see a d movie upgrade one more time and see it at imax if you have one available the extra screen size would make it even more amazing especially in the forests keep in mind that the combat forces are mercenaries and not government military they tell you this in the movie but it seems most people miss that brief piece of dialogue i hate it when movies use state and federal troops real heroes as the bad guys do not let your mind compare it to native american stories yeah it is the same story and the blue people often look and sound like indians but suspend your memory of dances with wolves and history class and enjoy the movie as a fresh experience you might also have to temporarily purge kaena and final fantasy spirits within so yeah the story is not original at all but the world around the story sure as heck is do not drink a liter of cola during the first hour it is almost hours long but it goes by as if it were a minute movie i cant think of any parts where you would want to spend minutes trecking to the bathroom the theater was packed and nobody made a sound for the duration of the movie so id take that as a sign that most other people were as glued to the screen as i was last but most important just go experience it this movie is worth supporting by seeing it at an expensive d showing first run theater i say experience it because even if you took all of the story elements out it would still be a fantastic experience the world that has been created is amazing and thankfully much of the movie feels almost like a safari where you are enveloped in that new world it really is an experience 
avatar will probably always remain one of my favorite movie experiences of all time i will never forget the incredible thrill of first viewing it in the movie theater i knew once i had purchased my first flat screen d television that avatar would be my very first d movie purchase and while i still love the movie watching the d version of avatar on my television screen was not nearly as thrilling as my first experience watching it on the regular theater d screen further i have since owned other d titles that come across much more startlingly real than this copy of avatar life of pi comes immediately to mind that is not saying that this d version of avatar is bad its just that i guess i was expecting more and that it didnt really deliver on that front having said that the movie itself is still a masterpiece in my book avatar was and is simply an almost magical experience in many respects and allows the view to almost transcend and suspend belief in the often dreary day to day of our existence it allows us to cavort in that magical fairy land that is navoo and run with and fly winged dragons with the navi this was for me among the most thrilling film experiences since the wizard of oz which i used to watch religiously every year as a kid and the first star wars movies ive heard all kinds of criticisms of avatar from political to other types of pans but as far as im concerned these people completely miss the forest for the trees they do not have the ability to recognize greatness when they see it these are the same people who panned the wizard of oz when it came out avatar has been so thoroughly reviewed that i have nothing more to add to the discussion that hasnt already been said ive stated my sole criticism and that is a minor one that the d version of this disc was not as impressive as id expected or hoped for beyond that the movie itself is still one of the greatest in the sci fi fantasy genre of all time and as a bonus or a curse are indeed powerful messages that many today would choose not to be there interfering with their pure entertainment experience but are nevertheless important points that need to be made like it or not i can absolutely recommend this movie to those who enjoy a totally immersive film going experience 
james cameron has done it again forget what the first reviewer here is telling you by not buying this movie this movie is worth every penny special features or not and i got my blu ray dvd edition for at wal mart the picture on both the dvd and blu ray is clear and sharp but the blu ray presentation on a lcd tv has to be seen to be believed been having some technical difficulties with my surround sound system but when i did put it on it sounded awesome after seeing this i am surprised it didnt get best picture oscar but the hurt locker did deserve it it was a great movie as well james cameron did such a great job with the presentation of this movie on blu ray no black bars on the top or bottom of the screen its the way all blu rays should present their movies i didnt have to make any adjustments to my settings to get it that way either my only hope is that when titanic finally makes it to blu ray the same considerations are made for that movie as was for avatar because i still cannot get over how beautiful the picture was to look at in closing all the reviewers on here can tell you what they will about this movie but only you can make the final choice on whether you want it or not make the right choice you wont be sorry 
so many movies promise much in the trailer and then fall flat in the theater avatar is one of the rare cases where no trailer can match the thrill of the film itself ive written many customer reviews for amazon but rarely award five stars with avatar i did not hesitate to give it the top rating it has all of the following in large measures fully captivating storytelling amazing visuals excellent voice acting for the animated portions and even such things as the score and credits worked really well and none of that even touches on the breakthrough technologies weve all heard about in the pre release hype i saw the movie in d and i certainly encourage everyone to do the same often modern d movies dont really seem to take full advantage of the possibilities of the form avatar has an unprecedented number of scenes with breathtaking d views then theres the brilliant creativity and imagination at work in designing the world of pandora itself the color palette used for the flora and fauna is simply beautiful to behold and so many of the creatures are just way cool especially the flying ones on the quality of animation its not perfect i have yet to see any cgi thats percent believable where things like facial expressions are happening but avatar comes very close as cgi characters engaged in conversation i was not distracted by the fact that i was watching cgi vs live action and i had fun comparing the avatars facial features to the live actors characters they were based on sigourney weavers for instance in all i havent enjoyed a movie going experience this much in a long time 
walked to see this at the local cinema on opening night in a snowstorm in nycs uws avatar at the theater was in d there was hardly a d scene should have asked for a refund but d movies without d was the norm then a few years ago and still is in many cases like dredd d an awful movie with the lure of d that did not exist in the theaters viewing room brother this d version from amazon rocks the d is magnificent stunning breathtaking awesome and any other compliment you can conjure up this movie is eye candy that is why i bought avatar in d wysiwyg and i got the best d experience ever this aint no einsteinian flick but it is entertainment this dvd is a strong case for never going to the cinema for d buy it you have never avatared like this 
it starts with the visual camerons epic just changed the landscape of cgi these effects meisters have mastered the tension of muscles working hard and the yielding where something presses against a bodys soft tissue these figures truly come to life instead of resembling over medicated puppets but the technology is only the paint and brush artistry comes from how theyre wielded camerons fantastic land and skyscapes his luminous nightworld his thundering devastation of war all set new standards of their own as well but imagery alone doesnt make a movie memorable its the plot the character the scripting and the acting if the word actually applies that engage the viewers feelings and imagination cameron succeeds again in more ways than i have words to describe although the ecofable tends toward the predictable its beautifully done the imagery and character form such a dense mesh of strands that readers can see almost anything they want in it religious moral social political im sure there are long arguments being held over every way pick the threads of this movie apart one thing i appreciate is how every scale holds something of interest minutiae like the latina pilots warpaint contribute moment by moment at the larger scales though cameron echoes c s lewiss thought that the greatest evil is conceived in clear carpeted warmed well lighted offices by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voices once those quiet voices have spoken von clausewitzs dictum comes to mind war is regarded as nothing but the continuation of state policy with other means even if the distinction of corporation and state blurs the adage remains true the grand visual scale of this movie demands a big screen detail will get lost when i see it again on dvd and i shall see it again but the complex flow of ideas and beliefs will come through as clearly as ever and i expect to see more in it with each viewing whether you want a thrilling visual spectacle or a modern morality play of the most complex sort avatar is what you want wiredwired reviewing the theatrical release
i first started watching this series in march with amazon prime i had access to the first two seasons that i watched in full over a two three week period to completely catch up i purchased the blue ray of season three and was not disappointed i highly recommend downton 
totally addictive show i love that its a wholesome show without the cursing and explicit sexuality terrific acting with great characters that make you care for them or dislike them 
i am not a big television watcher not many interesting shows this is an incredible show i am waiting for season 
there has been enough said about the series itself so i will review only the dvd set this entire box set played well without any issues it has some special features which i recommend watching because they are additional story lines i believe this version is the full uk version and more than what was featured on pbs in america i played these discs in my dvd player and my blu ray player without issue 
im hooked on this series and the players and characters like watching a historical soap opera only better hunger for more and more 
for a period drama this has all the aspects that make it riveting viewing amazing attention to historical detail and the characterization and story lines are first rate 
storyline costuming acting sets all worthy of stars rare that my wife and i both enjoy the same program equally downton seems to offer something for everyone i wouldnt call it family friendly only because kids might not find a lot to interest them but although the storylines are adult oriented there is no bad language here 
excellent series we have all three seasons now the brits know how to make a high quality classy series set in the world war i time period and the plot is superior with great british actors guys the life will love this series a must buy 
this series give you something to discuss with others who are also watching i love the dialogue and guessing what will happen next 
it was a great treat to receive the final few episodes even before they were broadcast it was a difficult trial to have to wait a week between chapters the quality is great the story is fantastic the acting is charming and the castle steals trhe show thank you my dearesr amazon to mis quote anthony strallen for offering such a pleasure i ordered this for my grand daughter on dvd and i got mine on my kindle and we are both very happy campers 
my wife called me all excited because amazon had season online but after we downloaded the show we found out that it is just a teaser 
i was going to order season and then savor the episodes on pbs each week but i couldnt wait and watched the entire season in one day now i am anxious for season 
this was great cant wait for more its one of the best series i have seen to date keep them coming
love this series both for the depiction of early s to the story lines intertwined with actual occurring events at that time 
i love downton abbey its a must see the storyline and scripting is spectacular everything about this show is great except thomas 
as always this show rivets me its got fabulous actors great dialogue and i love the period authenticity of the entire series 
i would love to follow this family until the end of time the story the cast the characters thrill me what a wonderful performance i love each and everyone of them 
cant wait for the third season dvds this is the best series in too long i re watch seasons and and they are fresh and new every time there are gaps in the story where cuts or condensations have been made please provide the full script even if it means increasing the price as the gaps in the story both seasons detract from the enjoyment of the series 
i had fallen behind on catching the downton episodes on pbs so i streamed the missed episodes on amazon hd streaming both the video and audio quality were excellent highly recommended

great acting wonderful story lines fabulous locales top quality tv which we are sorely lacking in america thank god for the bbc 
 this review is of seasons and the first episode of season ill be watching the rest of season as it becomes available i want to avoid spoilers or plot giveaways so ill just describe overall characteristics of the show this fascinating serious drama evinces a subtle generous love of humanity and makes you love humanity the wonderful qualities the foibles and the frailties and how all that stands up to the darker side of human nature the writing is excellent the shows plot always has me on edge out of dozens of characters two or three are bad and rather wicked but on the whole it seems every episode moves me at some point to shed a tear or two because of the kindness and goodness and generosity of various characters and its not that the writers set out in a contrived way to do that it all unfolds very naturally out of the drama itself the show is not a comedy but there are touches of humor here and there that manage to be moving even as they amuse the show is about an extended family of the british aristocracy and their servants the daughters are looking to get married so are some of the servants there is even a murder oh yes and world war i is going on during a number of episodes involving all the characters in huge changes and it turns out there are some beautifully noble qualities in some of these titled nobles as well as in a number of their servants the few characters with a more or less sinister side just add more drama nuance and depth to a show that on the whole reveals the best of human beings without oversimplifying them something about this show trusts human beings it makes me think that perhaps the best of britain is something very good indeed 
this is an absolutely wonderful series so glad i got into it ive learned so much about the period and issues i didnt know about the acting is top notch the scripting excellent and of course the costuming and settings are superb i consider it education as well as entertainment i do encourage anyone coming into the rd year to go back and watch the first years its well worth it ive now seen the whole series times and im still watching yeah to the brits for another quality series thank you 
i love downton abbey im new to it i streamed season through season over the last couple months halfway through the first episode i was totally hooked i love the characters and the way they and the story lines develop from episode to episode its great to see the clothes and decor and manners from that era and part of the world season was heartbreaking though during the last episode i shouted out loud no i think many watchers did the same how could it be i was so saddened by the events of the final episode in that season that i just sat there staring into space and finally just went to bed kind of funny to be so into any show that it would have that effect on me but it did im really looking forward to season 
yeah i have it and it continues the story at downton abbey that we have grown to love now i am lending it out to other lovers 
sadly i was unable to see episode of downton abbey on sunday but thanks to amazon i didnt miss out on all that happened now next sunday i wont feel a little lost because i missed part of it 
each episode leaves me breathless i dont recall ever being this emotionally involved in a series these are characters you can really care about 
started watching this series on recommendation from my sister i liked it right away as it has good plotsrunning throughout the upstairs uppercrust and downstairs servants i love maggie smith as an actress and shedoes not disappoint in this series i think she makes the show she can be so combative in a sweet sophistacatedway always with great style i have taken several characters to heart from the uppercrust to the downstairs servantsand look forward to what new developments happen with each show keep it coming 
looking forward to next season i love the characters and story line but hated the ending of this seasons story 
the evolution of british aristocracy at the turn of the century tragedy and sentiment mixed with humor depicting the societal changes of british society 
this is one of the best shows ever produced i have all of them on amazon streaming video stopped buyong dvds ages ago running out of room to store them my entire collection is either british sitcoms british mysteries midsomer murders is incredible or british drama and detective series inspector morse cant be compared the brits know how to produce quality unlike american dreck 
how would i rate the preview excellent best preview ive seen all week boffo going to tell all my friends to watch it 
season wow totally addicted to all the characters every jot and tittle worth watching over and over and over and over leech should get an academy award the most thats saying much for everyone in the cast crew film editing everything is a here just watch it no excuse to say no especially with the new prime offer 
this is some of the best tv around get into the program with the overviews of the previous seasons or better yet watch the other seasons here on amazon 
the much anticipated downton abbey series starts in spring carrying on from the superb christmas special which was set over the holiday period the first episode picks up with lady mary and matthew crawley at last about to get hitched but as usual there is quite a lot going on at downton both above and below stairs and you just know that nothing is going to go smoothly shirley maclaine makes her appearance as martha levinson lady granthams american mother as usual violet played by maggie smith manages to set the scene with some rather pithy comments martha has no time for the stuffy english and their traditions and is not slow to voice her opinion clearly she was introduced as a foil to maggie smith and the interplay between the two does work very well as one suspected it would violet seems to manage to continue to dominate any scene she is in there are plenty of dramatic moments in the new series as life on the downton estate returns to more as it was shown in the first series before the first world war when it served as a convalescent home for injured servicemen however there are new challenges for downton in the post war period and there has to be change for the estate to survive the interaction between the family and those that serve them below stairs continues to be a rich source of story lines for the script writers and is a major contribution to the success of the show downton abbey is the most successful costume drama from british tv since brideshead revisited some thirty years ago and this is quite an accolade as they produce a lot of this sort of drama in the uk regular viewers of downton will have been holding their breath wondering whether series could possibly keep up the very high standards of the previous episodes however we need not have worried and few will be disappointed with the latest series you really wonder how far downton can go personally i would not be surprised if it runs up to the s in due course so hopefully plenty to look forward to the really good news is that we know there will be a two hour christmas special in and although a fourth series has not yet been announced it will be very surprising if it does not follow 
what can i say great great great i truly like this series it is done very well not disappointing my sister told me i should give it a look 
my teenage nieces ask me what my guilty pleasure was and i told them downton abbey i showed them an episode from my computer and did they become fascinated beautiful settings great acting great directing love it i am thrilled the new season is here 
this show is a huge family saga and historical romance i always think i will resist being pulled into this world every single time after the first episode i am once again a da addict just try pulling me away right off the top let me get something off my chest i think bates is guilty am i the only one to think that way i just do not see his late wife a character who lived for revenge killing herself which is the only alternative i guess you could argue that this was a primo act of revenge but she was doing fabulously well against bates and anna revenge wise with limitless prospects for further success why end such a pleasurable experience which she could watch endlessly unfold she was already making them absolutely miserable if it turns out she was a suicide i think it is the only misstep the writers made so this remains a big plot element in season three downstairs with anna still trying to exonerate him upstairs we have the wedding for matthew and lady mary with further quarrels leading them all the way to the altar these two will not have a staid marriage and that is all to the good sybil is present with tom and will be shortly delivering her baby hugh bonneville the lord and master of the abbey is again beset on all sides he makes many mistakes based on his aristocratic viewpoint of the world at heart this is the prime problem for all of these people they grew up in an aristocracy and the aristocracy is precisely what is no longer needed in post world war one england but the best characters are the three older women the matriarchs of all other characters these are the dowager countess played wonderfully by maggie smith matthews mother and shirley maclaine as the present countesss american mother you would think the dowager countess would be a complete anachronism with the future being firmly represented by the other two matriarchs however as the power behind the throne smith is incredible there is always power behind the throne and it is often a woman who has it smith thus continues to be a major delight as usual i am anxiously awaiting the next episode sigh 
this was the first time i have used the prime it was a free trial and now i am a lifer this show is amazing watched both seasons back to back love love love it 
this is the way life was lived in england for a time and despite the class system it so easy to be sympathetic towards this aristocratic family and their problems it puts us in a different world 
i can not get enough of this show it sounded horrible when i first heard about it but i decided to give it a chance and i truly enjoy watching the characters evolve 
after being criticized for his soapy second season of the british television series julian fellowes takes us back to a much slower pace in downton full of the lovely little things that made the first season so delightful and then crushes us criticisms of this series predictability and tired plot twists notwithstanding this season is less problematic with its twists than previous ones but we still cant escape the never ending drudgery of poor edith who is thwarted at every turn i sincerely hope the writer gives her a break someday just when one possibility of future happiness turns up fellowes throws in a plot twist right out of a bronte novel to further complicate her life theres also a redundancy and lack of clarity in certain plot twists such as annas sudden realization of vera bates motives which were obvious to us all last season but its always funny always charming and always romantic even if it does make us cry buckets of tears before the season is out it threatens to take one character from us only to deviate into two shocking unexpected deaths in a later episode as always the acting is magnificent and this season theres a lot to work with emotionally from a death to near financial disaster and the arrival of a newborn to downton maggie smith is given all the best lines but the flirtations between matthew and mary are delightful to watch in fact theres one sneaked kiss in the first episode that is particularly fun but frankly the last two minutes of this series are the most depressing ive ever seen it ruined my christmas and have convinced me not only never to watch that episode again but not to buy any of the seasons beyond this one pack the hankies fans youll need them 
never before has the clash of cultures and times played such an integral part as the family is beginning to show division between those willing to adjust to change and those staunchly holding onto the old ways even between spouses dear mrs levinson coras mother serves here to boldly state the issue the idealists diehards emerge as the dowager countess lord grantham lady mary and mr carson their position though sympathetic due to attachment to their characters is an increasingly difficult one to defend the big changes in the opening series episode are the financial loss of the family and the introduction of coras mother coming for the wedding with that blunt and indomitable personality to my viewing she definitely daunts the dowager trumping her in audacity in nearly every encounter no doubt the financial vulnerability plays a strong part in that it may be a case of whether you prefer blunt over acidity or vice versa the attachment between matthew and mary was never so poignant as revealed in the night before wedding sequence at marys bedroom door matthew is so richly warm as he affirms his love and repeats to mary the words from tom branson that he could not be content in life without her regardless of their disagreement so effective the mystery still holds concerning bates as a darker side is showing up with his cell mate since he has been so insistent in not revealing things to shield others in the past perhaps that is still the case i wouldnt be surprised if annas probings provide necessary evidence and we find that again he has been acting in honor by not revealing something that could have cleared him as to his cell mate the pressure of his circumstances could well account for his unwillingness to take anything off someone he doesnt have to a lot of good people believe in his character this episode as seen on pbs severely breaks the smooth transition of story lines previously experienced making a complete uk edition mandatory hopefully there will be help in the very rapid moving from one story line to the next as presently it is a bit of a whiplash at times one is trying to digest what was just presented but is immediately being thrown into another diverse and complicated scenario before the difference in the broadcast and full version was an abrupt introduction of a character without the lead up in the full edition but now it is more a hurl from one venue to another especially in the latter part it will be very interesting to see how this central theme of change plays out among the parties along with the various fates hanging in the balance and old scores to be settled 
after viewing seasons and for free on my kindle i have been purchasing each episode of season i thought id be able to catch up with the t v version but i found out the uk version which is what ive been watching is behind the u s version so now ill have to purchase at least two more before i can start watching it on t v 
this show has so much to offer great story line terrific cast of actors and the dry humor of maggie smith if youre not watching downton abbey youre missing out 
now its not game of thrones i equate it more to pride and prejudice the tv show it is funny and the characters are acted well enough that you actually root for them or in some cases hope something terrible happens to them 
i have thought long and hard why i like this show and i cantput my finger on it i am a walking dead dexter game of thronesfan and the last thing i expected was to love downton i definatelyrecommend for anyone to watch this 
i watched season and for free in a marathon and then i was addicted i couldnt score season for free i finally sold a puppy so i could get my season fix 
this is one of the best series on television the other one is game of thrones thoroughly enjoy the acting the abbey and the script will continue purchasing as we go along in order to enjoy later again 
so many twists and turns the ending will bring you to tears and leaves you wanting more when is season 
my wife is addicted to this show i bought it for her and she watches it on her kindle fire hd every night she is always trying to tell me the plot and loves the characters 
i like how the story evolves and the depiction of the history of the time period driving the story the quality of the production is outstanding and the character development really draws one into the story no spoilers from me i liked that no one is spared from the realities of life stuff happens to accommodate the actors real lives and to push the story forward life is messy outside and on the television screen oh and maggie smith as the dowager countess is absolutely fabulous 
the series is fascinating and gives you a good idea on how life is was for the elite in the past the characters are believable and you begin to care about them cant bear to miss an episode 
weve been hooked couldnt not have this season to prepare for januarys season watched all seasons within the last two weeks we are ready 
this series is so much fun it transports you to another time with its close attention to detail from costumes to furnishings
on recommendation from a friend i bought the dvd wow i love love love this series well written and just so inspiring about a time when civility was practiced in all of society enjoy all the characters interactions especially between the americans and brits 
my favorite character is maggie smith but i could watch this show over and over this show not only has a castle that is marvelous but its characters are fascinating andeach show makes you want to see the next one come on season 
this series is just some of the best tv ever produced i watched all of season and am now excited that season has started i look forward to each episode the acting is stellar the plot interesting the characters all interesting michelle dockery is fabulous in her portrayal of lady mary i had the opportunity to visit highclere castle in the uk in where much of the series is filmed we went on the tour it is an amazing place even more fun to watch the show now and recall standing in many of the rooms used in the series highly recommended if you enjoy period drama at its best 
this is a lovely series that is carried sporadically on local telly stations here really enjoy the plots the costumes the completely different takes on reality that these folk have well done we cannot offer enough praise for this show 
after seeing the first episode at a local preview screening for the new season it will definitely be worth owning i recommend it to anyone 
this is a superb english classic i got hooked on the series after watching season and after watching season i ordered the two dvd box set on amazon com i pre ordered the season dvd and i know once this series is finished running on pbs and season is released i will be watching the entire series again only one episode has aired for season however the intereactions between maggie smith and shirley maclaine is definately going to be a focal point with this series dare i hope there will be a season 
whats not to like downton abbey captures all the style and grace of aristocratic england without the stuffiness one might expect from an english period piece the characters are all unique and their story lines create a patchwork quilt of subplots that continue to draw in the audience as it moves from one story to another a soap opera perhaps but the most stylish and engaging that ive ever seen all class and no trash 
downton abbey is a great series so great to have a season all on one dvd hope we have many more seasons
i have faithfully followed da from the first episode of the first season now at the beginning of season on masterpiece on pbs my husband has finally woken up to the story as a result we began once more at the beginning and are now up to speed we both love it keep it coming 
we recently joined the ranks and began with season as recommendsd by a friend another tv marathon ensued references to justified boardwalk empire and we were left in eager anticipation of season anotber masterpiece theater masterpiece this wont disappoint 
this is one of the few television programs that my wife and i can agree on weve been watching since the first season and there hasnt been a bad episode yet although set nearly years ago it somehow feels more real than almost any reality show thats now filling the airwaves highly recommended 
a real masterpiece the castle the clothes the furniture the plot everything is first class good good good good good
cant say enough great things about this show i love it gets better every season cant wait for next weeks episode 
the only problem with this series is the long wait between the end of one season and the start of another i love this program 
the characters are intriguing and so well played that weve begun to care what happens to them maggie smith is amazing as the dowager countess 
best setting best writing best story line best acting best everything i like this entire series so much all seasons that i bought two more sets for my sisters 
this has to be one of my favorite costume drama pieces ever to come out of england and i guess im definitely not alone in that opinion i have watched them avidly on pbs and then went out and bought each dvd as theyve come out and re watched them again the intersecting stories of the nobility upstairs and the servants downstairs continues to intrique and enthrall i love to love some characters and i love to hate some characters and some of them even switch in my affections over time season three takes place in the early s now that wwi is behind downton the estate still isnt safe as they take a hit in their finances and have to come to terms with the idea of modernization mary and matthew are finally together yeah and their wedding is beautifully done but matthew is clearly hopeful of a child and heir to be edith loses out on her wedding dreams but discovers her own voice i must say i have gone from disliking her to liking her in this season the same with ms obrien as she becomes a deeper character who is sorry for her mistakes but still has that sharp tongue while thomas well what can one say about thomas he will emerge a bit of a dark hero by the end of this season not sure what i think about the new character of rose a young would be flapper but it looks like she will be joining the regular cast and so far im liking her also adored the brief bit with shirley mclaine as coras mother and her sarcastic interaction with the dowager maggie smith what can be better with two fabulous actors like this loved every moment of their conversational banter the world is changing and downton is changing with it despite all the attempts of our favorite grumpy by the book yes mlord butler none of the characters stay static in this show and no one is safe from an untimely end which makes the stories not only interesting but really sends you on an emotional rollercoaster just when things look their best and brightest watch out non character stars of the show include the beautiful s style clothing bring back feathered and jeweled headbands the vintage cars and oh my that wonderful trip to the scottish highlands that rounds out the season perfect just perfect if you love downtown you will love this season even if it will break your heart at times cant wait until season 
though this has a soap opera feel to it at times which i dont particularly care for i really enjoy this show it has the right amount of suspense to keep you hanging until the next episode and i really enjoy this historical aspects which are portrayed accurately overall one of my favorite shows 
first rate story first rate producing first rate actors i am not a tv fan at all but this one held my attention from beginning to end how come the brits walk circles around hollyweird yet again 
i give all episodes of downton abbey a thumbs up a rating of love this series just wish there were more episodes per season hope there are many more seasons to come 
if you havent seen all of season and the christmas special called a journey to the highlands you probably dont want spoilers i am going to give a synopsis of the special features and thats difficult without giving some facts away as to season two important characters die in two different places on this disc set i wont say who but the actor playing the one that dies during the christmas special wanted to leave the show the deaths might make you want to take julian fellowes writer and creator to task but then again having tragedy amidst the joy is what makes downton abbey a really really great show i have a couple people hooked on downton abbey who have never watched masterpiece theater before this season dvd set contains three discs it does have the christmas special i have received my dvd set ordered on this page and it has parts of season plus a journey to the highlands and special features disc disc has parts and of season and extra english subtitles are available special features behind the drama minutes this is an fabulous overview of the first two seasons with clips from the two seasons interviews and rehearsal scenes what i particularly liked is that its not just a rehash of the plot lines it includes why a plot line or character development was important or undertaken per the narrator before wwi there were million people in service in england highclere castle with more than bedrooms there was plenty to do and plenty of rules and the hierarchy below stairs was even stricter than above stairs when a scene takes place upstairs they are really filmed at highclere castle when below stairs though they were filmed on sets at ealing studios thats because though the magnificent upstairs is much the same except for bathrooms now as it was before wwi the kitchens and downstairs have been modernized remember the scene where the turk enters lady marys bedroom and she says you and my parents have something in common you think i am much more of a rebel than i am which is pretty humorous in itself given that mary is most tradition hide bound of the sisters julian fellowes tells us that the whole dead turkish lover is based on a true story a friend of his who owns a big house came upon a diary of one of his great aunts and this whole incident is recorded the commentators also touch on the spanish flu epidemic which may have killed up to people world wide most flus are most lethal to the very young and the elderly ive read that the spanish flu however was most lethal to healthy adults it made your immune system go wild attacking your body as well as the virus so the healthier your immune system was the more likely it was going to kill you disc disc has parts and of season english subtitles are available there are no special features on this disc disc disc has parts of season as well as a journey to the highlands the christmas special and special features english subtitles are available special features downton in minutes

gareth neame executive producer shirley maclaine plays martha levinson coras american mother dan stevens plays matthew crawley and pete gaine from motorhouse hire ltd who supplied matthews marvelous car in season its when we think we think the roaring twenties but as caroline mccall points out i think peoples perception of the s is very different from julian fellowes points out that the charleston dance craze didnt happen until the hair and costume designers had to show fashions changing gradually because its not as if everyone started dressing like flappers in the rigid laced up corsets of before the war give way to bandeau corsets and breast flattening bras even the men show subtle changes in their suit jackets etc except for mr carson of course who continues to wear exactly the same suit he always has it wasnt just clothing that was changing as alastair bruce says we see this great imperial family gradually alter as moral conscience takes us on a different path very much the way the imperial british empire was altering the wedding of lady mary minutes commentators include many from extra with new ones victoria brooks head of publicity for downton abbey liz turbridge producer matthew sparky ellis location manager charmain adams production designer maggie harris resident of bampton where the wedding was filmed rev david lloyd vicar of bampton timothy word crowd

the first extras as well as robert bathurst plays sir anthony strallan denis maguire supporting artist plays the photographer at the church david holt special effects technician and damian butlin standby propman poor edith how many of us think that julian fellowes says her self rebuilding will become another part of the story the subliminal message i think is we must get behind the wheels of our own lives we should take a poll did sir anthony act out of misguided honor or is he just a jerk and if we dont think hes a jerk how about lord roberts part in this the men of downton abbey minutes commentators appear in the first specials this focuses on how wwi was the changemaker whether you were above stairs or below stairs hugh bonneville says after the turmoil of the war robert thinks in a way that life will return to the way it was before the way and of course it never will alastair bruce adds people have survived something in wwi and they are never going to forget what theyve gone through it changes their view of what they expect from the world shirley maclaine at downton minutes maclaine hadnt been watching downton abbey herself but she had friends who were addicts its a sign of how good the show is that it could get a shirley maclaine to be in it sophie mcshera groans i didnt get to meet shirley maclaine and im so jealous rob james collier is excited just talking about the meeting of shirley maclaine and dame maggie smith on the show they are going to be epic they really are two actual legends on screen battling it out the only thing i can liken it to is deniro vs pacino in heat heat is an american movie behind the scenes the cricket match minutes many commentators appear before new ones are eddie williams rd assistant director adam ghillam camera operator

change of clothes only one cast member taking part in the match actually knew how to play cricket thanks to stand ins and clever camera work you wouldnt know it behind the scenes a journey to the highlands many familiar commentators with these new ones lily james plays lady rose macclare andy goddard director for this episode and diana scrivener choreographer for this christmas special cast and crew traveled for filming to inveraray castle scotland seat of the real duke of argyll incredibly beautiful scenery but everybody complains about the outdoor scenes where they were attacked by hordes of midges for the show inveraray stands in for duneagle castle home of sir roberts cousin hugh shrimpy macclare his year old daughter rose will according to julian fellowes become a prominent character going forward the staff that stays home at downton abbey arent forgotten and the episode shifts back and forth between scotland and downton new romance is in the air for more than one character lesley nichol says she asked fellowes to give mrs patmore a love interest and he complied lesley says mr tufton has taken over our local shop hes a bit of a flirty ponce which shocks her mrs patmore sideways really because i dont think people flirt with mrs patmore season of downton abbey starts filming in late february i cant wait to see it 
worth every cent in price every minute in time a powerful period costume drama some call a soap with historical excellence upstaged by perfection in acting its the roots of historical family drama for the st century youll drool your champagne over locations costumes props and sets and its to continue for a th season the biggest question is not will it maintain the uk and us growing following but will it contain matthew crowley dan stevens but hes at least back doing his best and wedding mary michelle dockery and will take over the realm of downton abbey even though earl robert hugh bonneville has bungled the finances always a plot among the early english wealthy families yes much of the former cast is back joined with the american upstart actress shirley maclaine playing coras elizabeth mcgovern american mother with this huge star going against the impeccable delivery of lines from dowager violet maggie smith the excitement and cast excellence remains combined these drive a thread of sharp spark delight through this third series shes welcomed by cast and viewers past issues like imprisonment the bates anna john also continues in romance tragedy form although the uk gets first peeks it is america that is driving worldwide success it will continue in some form and at the peak of seductive drama to downton abbey fans it is just family being viewed the english lifestyle of the aristocrat and their home staff has never been presented better since upstairs downstairs only time will tell if downton abbey fans will drive this series beyond the regal success of u d i suspect they will its powerful writing coming from the pen of julian fellowes and perhaps will end only at his decision the writing behind the abbey is as deliciously alluring toward characters as catherine cooksons work already the public demands more i and my wife included she nearly wore out season dvds and will do likewise to season well order season as soon as the listing appears subtitled not a rental its a must own place it on the all time classic shelf do you own seasons downton abbey seasons limited edition set original uk version
love it the dowager countess maggie smith steals the show with just a few words lady mary is great and i love the way edith is developing that branson seems a bit softer is a plus his hateful radical attitude is not comfortable to watch cant wait for the next season hope it goes on for years hollywood should take a hint and stop the killling movies i dont watch anymore 
downton abbey season the story has captivated my attention from the first time i saw season on pbs so cal absolutely perfect the way each character is blended with the other one gets so intrenched with with each story line it takes you out of this world of multi problems and you become a part of the entire cast you are there although i own all the dvds of all three seasons i still go back a review all of them again each time i catch a line that had been missed or a scene the had been over looked i still watch each program on pbs so cal each sunday although i know what will happen waited impatiently for each season to be released the photography is out of this world the outdoors and especially the location really enjoyed every minute to date however the story can end here loosing interest because you have eliminated two of the main family characters sybil crawley matthew crawley strange i have lost interest in the new an younger people that are being introduced too much like tv america petty situation comedy ergo i think you have are turning a wonderful classic story into a modern day soap opera and we all know they are no longer on television personal belief i think that julian fellowes should have stopped after mary crawley had her child grandson heir to downton would have been a wonderful cliff hangernow the story line s have become disengaged also shirley maclaine did an expected job of playing shirley maclaine the last of the rat pack outside of her every star in downton abbey deserves an academy award non of course could top dame maggie smith accolades to the cast directors producers and writers excellent job enjoyed every minute viewed over and over too bad this is the end for me it has now lost the magic and becoming standard america situation tragedy respectfully james alan love first generation american my parents grandparents are from england 
im going to love this new season i so much enjoyed the other and have watched them more than once 
 possible spoilers i have been a fan of downton abbey since the first episode transported me to another time and place i have watched with awe the brilliant attention to detail and wonderful actor actresses and writing propel this show to be a continued hit not only in england but around the world i cant wait for series sure some things in made me sad i really wish the actor and actress who chose a different path would have stayed on at downton i for the life of me cant fathom why you would leave such a popular show that is such an international hit but to each his or her own i think it was handled as well as could be given the circumstances i would certainly rather have matthew die than him and mary separate due to not getting along or some such nonsense and easy out either way i think anyone with any taste for quality dramatic series would not just enjoy this series they will adore it 
the acting is outstanding all the different characters are well developed and well played i caught up to season after watching all of season on amazon prime now im hooked 
its a great show if you not watching you need to be its set in the s so come and see
i couldnt wait for the us version so i had to buy the uk blu ray series and its every bit as exciting as the last two im guessing the us version will include the upcoming christmas episode plus some extra bonuses so i guess i am gonna end up buying it but honestly waiting till feb for the series was way too long lol 
with gorgeous period sets a wide range of characters a lot of feel good moments and a few very sad circumstances season three of downton abbey is still one of the most enjoyable shows on television when the season opens its and the ladies of the house are all wearing updated fashions mary and matthew are finally getting married edith is hoping for a romance of her own sybil is pregnant and may not make it home from ireland for the wedding mr bates is still serving time in prison and thomas and obrien are no longer plotting evil together theyre now enemies this dvd divides the show into more segments than the pbs version did which makes it a little confusing if youre trying to follow american blog postings about each episode but everything is here including the christmas special so named because it was shown on christmas day in britain but isnt set during the christmas season instead of a yuletide celebration show the family is off to scotland a special treat for people like me who are also fans of monarch of the glen 
downton abbey season does not disappoint just like seasons and i can talk about thomas mr bates the cook the prostitute mary grandmama and all of them but i wont downton abbey will draw you in and make you yearn for the next episode better than er the office and minutes 
this show is awesome but beware the last show of the season the last scene really made me so very mad lol
i absolutely love this show and for those of you that dont want to pay for episodes they are available to stream on pbs org shortly after they air i watched season episode tonight it aired last sunday here where i live 
i loved the option of purchasing the tv pack so that the episodes were waiting for me the minute they released i also got to see the entire rest of the season a few weeks early as a perk along with the minimal discount the convenience is worth it 
my wife and i became hooked on downton abby after watching the first two seasons it is simply one of the best series on tv today the upcoming wedding of matthew and mary is taking center stage as the season starts this season is so dramatic and the storyline so involved that i do not want to spoil any of it for you lets just say that there are several shockers in this season and it will leave you wanting more action tragedy love and tragedy make this season so involved it is not like you are watching a movie or tv series because the characters are so real that you feel that you are living the storyline with them this feeling is brought across the screen and into your home because of the excellent cast and the perfect script that just keeps you hanging onto every event this is television drama at its best and it is so good that it is addicting my wife and i think it is the best show on tv and we love watching it we rated it a star series and recommend it to you it makes me wonder why american tv cannot make shows like this anymore 
masterpiece classics are so well classy they are wonderful stories worth viewing no foul language dignity and something you can share with the entire family ive ordered each season 
one of the best series that there is the characters above and below stairs are an interesting bunch julian fellows has created a mostly believable household where not everyone keeps to his or her station the story begins in the pre wwi time period and currently takes place in the s interesting changes in mores and circumstances 
like most viewers of downton abbey ive been addicted to the series from the first episode of the first season the excellent cast fine writing and the wonderful sets and costumes make it a dont miss for me in season the noble crawley family and their servants at downton abbey having survived the vissitudes of world war i more or less intact are faced with new economic and social pressures the world is changing and the path is no longer automatically smoothed for bearers of noble titles and distinguished lineages the earl of grantham gets things off to a rough start by mismanaging his wife coras wealth so badly that he loses it all and faces having to sell downton abbey his cousin heir and new son in law matthew crawley manages to sort things out in the end but its only the beginning the earls daughters mary now married to matthew at last edith and sybil all continue to have romantic ups and downs while the dowager countess finds her place as queen of downton challenged by the arrival of martha levinson the american mother of lady grantham below stairs the staff continues to soldier on beset by scandal and romantic turmoils of their own eventually tragedy strikes both below and above stairs leaving plenty of loose ends and questions that will lead to a season and who knows how many more the fine cast headlined by hugh bonneville maggie smith michelle dockery penelope wilton and jim carter among many others has some stellar additions most notably shirley maclaine downton abbey is over the top sometimes campy and with more plot twists and turns than any five or six other soap operas but its always sheer escapist fun 
i didnt want to start a new television odyseey but im very glad i started this one my wife and i started watching from the beginning of the series in late december we are fully caught up after several marathons using prime has been great 
the cast is amazing the story line engaging the scenery breathtaking the music marvelous the costumes spectacular dame maggie smith and shirley maclaine what a pair 
i really liked all of the characters the vintage dresses were absolutely beautiful the story line keeps you wondering what is going to happen next it was done in good taste and did not subject the viewer to sex scenes 
ive only seen the first three episodes of season but it looks like its going to be another winning season 
the us edition of da season original uk edition is disks minutes which includes in addition to the episodes the christmas in the highlands as well as interview with shirley maclaine and some other behind the scenes specials amazon offers the best price pbs offers an even better deal if free shipping i cant wait until this arrives the end of january after football season this will keep us occupied for some time just thought i would share this info 
i purchased the original uncut uk version because i thought it would have scenes not included in the version we get in the us other than a few slang words that are used in the uk and not here i dont see any difference in these versions to what i have been watching i still love the show and am glad to have them and will purchase seasons and as soon as possible but it doesnt seem necessary to buy the uk version if anyone has had a different experience i would appreciate knowing 
i am addicted to downton abbey and i dont typically watch tv especially series cant wait to see what happens next 
what else can i say its downton abbey best series ever even though i watched every episode on pbs i had to own the entire series 
this is a fabulous series i have really enjoyed it the customers are amazing i have learned a lot in the process
i love this and already have season one it is a must for any libary collection i cant wait for the next season to be released it holds you spell bound as you watch with anticipation to see how things unfold 
i can tell you the start to the present my dvr recorded all the eposides especially season which i have shed many tears on this season i love it 
i love the relationships in this series both good and bad very positive and hopeful about life the historical setting makes it easy to relate to 
i just finished season on dvd and do not wish to spoil the experience for anyone by divulging any of the plot needless to say the plot thickens both upstairs and downstairs with many twists and turns the acting is beyond superb as you would expect from past seasons i couldnt stop watching the dvd till i got completely thru all episodes so engrossing ill be loaning this to everyone theres a long line 
somehow my wife and i missed seasons and but after a single episode of season we are hooked 
im not a big tv fan especially with the drivel they have on these days but this is thee best show out there i can not say enough good things about it my wife and i have watched the first season or times i am constantly in awe at how well the story flows how great the actors are the advancement of the plot in each show the only complaint i have is that the season is only episodes only there should be but past that this show is so very much worth watching ok i lied i have other complaints about the show season is hard to deal with the changes to the family and the loss of members has weighed heavily on my wife and i we love each and every character and to have some ripped away like that is horrid weve got an emotional investment in these people perhaps im too invested in what is essentially a hyped up soap opera but its such a well made soap opera get this series youll not regret it 
i just finished re watching the first two seasons of downton abbey and i was curious what events would make it into this summary review dear god i rather hate myself for giggling so much but just you try to watch with a straight face as poor mr pamuks corpse flops so comically so many times i dare you the lighthearted tone and the perfect interspersing of dialogue from the show itself made for an excellent encouragement to get on with the watching of season three jolly good everyone 
i do not receive any tv channels i turned it off and this is the one item i have purchased and downloaded in over a year of not television the characters are well rounded the storyline makes sense the filming is great pbs has another hit on their hands get the tissues out 
julian fellowes is either really brilliant or a big turkey heart breaker this was a major hankie experience and beyond that it would be hard to say anything without revealing a story well worth seeing not quite dickens not quite jane austen but definitely holding the hardship and personal interludes included in these authors works up and down and all around the viewer is led downton abbey is saved downton abbey is doomed the characters and their relationships are so well wrought down to the extant cultural limitations of behavior and manner with great compassion and surly back biting and everything ordinary in between the class differences are blurred with maggie smiths character seemingly so intolerant the most accepting and not with love care and common sense her life experience shared by no one else can dictate nothing else highly recommended for a good escape to another oddly compelling planet of life experience while mr fellowes may pull some heart strings sometimes the good cry is worth the tears 
the writing and acting is excellect and it gives us a taste of what the english aristocracy was like in the early part of the th century the downstairs staff is also given equal time i would recommend it to anyone who likes english dramas 
downtown abbey season i used tv pass to watch last three eposodes well worth it reccomend this to anyone that is unable to wait for to roll around cant wait for season now im hooked 
okay yes creator writer julian fellows has a tendency to wrap up story lines a little too quickly and easily and yes downton abbey is in some senses a soap opera but soap opera elevated to the nth degree of style wit and compelling charaterization the acting is uniformly superb the visuals sets costumes are gorgeous and once youre hooked you can only rejoice in this further season of stories from the abbey 
awesome the best mini series ever the scenery the castle the decor the reproduction of period clothing the acting the story line are just outstanding 
season good season great season hold on too your seat my wife says i have serious problems i agree i just like it 
i rated this stars baised on the first two seasons i am looking forward to season and expect that it will not disapoint i do not see any weaknesses in this production writing cast everyone associated with it 
i cant say enough about this series if you love time pieces then sit your booty down in front of your tv and give this series a shot you wont regret it im only to episode and i cant wait for the rest of the season 
well all those people who complain about the quality of tv programs must not have watched this it is beautifully done with finely drawn characters cannot waitfor more 
i can hardly wait to get series this is on of the best shows and best way to watch you will want to see series one and two now a love story and mystery of a complicated family in a time long gone 
this is one of the best repeaating series in recent years in my opinion im glad i watched it from the beginning and now to be able to go back and rewatch it from the beginning again oh boy 
this item arrived earlier than expected was eight dollars cheaper than what i originally paid on pre order credited back to my account and makes me feel special because i was able to get ahead of others in the u s who are watching the show on pbs i sat up late last night just savoring the atmosphere of this wonderful show tonight i will watch it again with my husband who is jealous that i got ahead of him next year i will pre order the new season again best of all you cant feel guilty when you buy an item that supports public tv 
i just downloaded and watched the remaining as of yet unaired episodes of dowton abbey season on amazon this season was by far the best one yet many of the events surprised me both the exciting twists and the tragic this is one of the best written dramas on television if you havent tuned in yet youre really missing out the only drawback i can name is that i now have to wait for season four 
after the great war the extended crawley family and the many servants who keep the estate running must adjust to life and change as society changes this is a well acted well crafted drama that illustrates the life stories that affect everyone rich and poor aristocrat and working class without distinction there are secrets cunning manipulations success loss sex love politics a murder conviction the weekly show is well paced with a well defined story arc that keeps the minutes flowing this is not a stuffy or boring period piece make your guy comfortable with a pizza and beer ok you can step up the beer maybe stella artois but hide the sherry until your moms visiting after or shows he will just have to know whats gonna happen 
except to say i am completely hooked i absolutely love downton abbey it is such a rich wonderful series i want more 
i was reluctant to watch this series but my daughter prodded me by the end of the second episode i was hooked now at the end of the third season im addicted so much so that one of the characters personalities has wormed its way into being part of our familys coded lexicon its obrien as in so and so would never have noticed such and such on her own except that shes being obrien ed ha excellent tv for a change watched season on amazon com for less than the cost of dvds and i can go back and re watch as often as i want great concept thanks amazon 
id say the writer and the actors above all make this show what it is but the setting and the costumes are outstanding too i like its swift pace and the intimate nature of the story development with all the different characters the show does tend to get a bit soapy from time to time which is too bad but it certainly never gets dull 
heard about downton abbey from a friend for those who love maggie smith and gosford park it was tremendously satisfying i heard that it kind of stalls out in season boy were they wrong enjoying this while knitting on a cold winters day or night 
it is hard to keep the momentum going in a series which is basically about relationships without a bit of either ho hum settling in or it getting maudlin and soap opera ish but downton abbey seems to avoid those traps and deliver freshness and surprise each episode there is enough continuity so you can enter the downtown world each week and feel at home and enough novelty in characters and situations to keep it from becoming stale season brims with energy shirley mclaine is believable as lord granthams mother in law from america and plays her role with dash and panache it would be easy to be too campy in that role but that is avoided the three daughters are getting married off which fast forwards the story line you cant help but wonder what else is going to happen to the family at the beginning of the s the costumes continue to delight i love having this series in our streaming library as my sons like to watch it when they come home they like the historical aspects of the show i hope this series continues for a long time great job by julian fellowes on the screen writing and production of this enthralling series it has the right balance of humor and drama 
brings alive so many british social history novels and history books wonderful characters costumes and setting just delightful to have the more british version 
absolutely amazing loved it all three seasons are amazing and i know people that love the old time will enjoy this its like watching pride and prejudice times 
i just love this movie had a sad ending but do hope they make a sequel because it just cant stop there looking forward to them making season it is so popular they must see that it is a best seller by the way its amazing that they can make such a wonderful series of a movie and no bad language the movie industry should take notice of this and get their act together 
update i was considering buying this season a second time i originally bought it in november when it became available in the u k and then was very angry when i watched it on pbs in january to find that there were many additional scenes in episodes being shown on pbs i felt cheated however after reading several comments on one of the reviews here it appears that this dvd offering is no better than that i purchased from amazon com uk why there should be additional scenes shown on pbs and not included in the dvd versions is a mystery but many many viewers are now aware of this discrepancy and hopefully it will not happen again as the producers go forward with season this marvelous series gets better and better the guiding spirit that makes this production so much more wonderful than others is the fact that the creator julian fellows seems to have a benevolent view of life i havent encountered this view since i last read the brother cadfael mysteries by elllis peters edith pargeter fellows has decided to show people at their very best a most unusual approach to drama i think that this is the reason for downton abbeys world wide success dramatic contrast which is necessary to keep our interest riveted on the characters means that the crawley family will continue to encounter adversity but it is the way that they pull together that makes us care about them so deeply i received season about mid november and have watched it every day since then it is glorious i do have to complain that fellows has gone off the rails once again cf the trial of john bates in the scene where tom branson is allegedly given a drink that makes him act oddly in fact branson talking with larry gray puts his cocktail glass down and walks away larry puts something in toms glass immediately thereafter dinner is announced and they all go in to dinner at that time with before dinner cocktails being a very new phenomenon people did not take their cocktails into dinner its not like today when people are in a restaurant and take their cocktails from the bar to the dining room at that time wine was served with every course and everyone would have left their cocktails in the drawing room there was therefore no opportunity for tom to drink the doctored cocktail i think it is insulting that fellows assumes that his viewers will not recognize the impossibility of these scenes the trial scenes were outrageous since there was no possible way for the prosecuting attorney to have knowledge of the events that mrs hughes and miss obrian were forced to testify to in season i was delighted to see that the resolution of batess situation was well thought out logically and rationally and totally in character for everyone so julian fellows can stay within the bounds of the possible when he wants to i wish he wanted to more often why he allows his near perfect series to be marred by these digressions into the impossible is a mystery to me 
this has become the highlight of my day i look forward to a good cup of coffee and watching this wonderful series it is so well written and acted that my own thoughts throughout the day now have their accent and speech patterns 
one of my favorites shows ever i really enjoyed the tv pass so that i could watch the whole season early 
there are so many great story lines going on it this series and they all have me on the edge of my seat i love that even the characters who appear to be unlikable grow on you and you begin to have simpathy for their character as you get to know them from the upstairs story lines to the downstairs servants lives it all is interesting and how they work together is amazing 
if i could i would give downton abbey stars o love this engaging series thanks masterpiece theatre for another fantastic pbs series bravo 
the characters and story are captivating it is a view into the past but human nature is never changing i just recommend if you havent watched any downton abbey start with season 
this series has captured our hearts as it has so many others we cant wait to watch them all again some day 
i was so excited to see that amazon offered season then saw that it will not be available until january which is when it will be shown on pbs com free it just doesnt make sense to buy although i can hardly wait to see it 
enjoy watching and cant wait for the new season it is beautiful well acted and very much a quality drama in the pbs english tradition
the video had a couple of minor skips in it annoying but not a deal breaker as to the series itself there is no better way to pass the time delightful 
i really enjoy series and movies with this theme its been awhile since something new has come out and i am enjoying this 
love the show loved the first two seasons and this season looks like it lives up to the other two seasons 
i love this tv series it feels like a mini series as the filming is extremely high quality and acting is superb 
i started watching this show and was delighted that this was something i could watch with my year old daughter and my something grandparents my daughter could learn a little history without force like putting spinach in brownies and the grandparents could delight in the costumes cinematography and the whole englishness of the series of course anything by masterpiece has been good but this is great i plan on purchasing all the season and giving the as gifts for my families yeah to the producers of this show we love it and i wait each week for the new episode i have several of my freind hooked as well this is good quality family television for any who havent seen it no nudity no swearing some war related and jail related mail violence it is a winner 
it has surpased my exspectation and has given us many hours of enjoyment looking forward to the next season greatly
i bought this set of dvds as soon as it came it great tv series i highly recommend it i thoroughly enjoyed it 
really enjoying downton abby and cant wait for episode this coming sunday i havent received my blu ray copy yet but hope to get it next week i think they are sending them out on the th of januaryi loved seasons and and watch them over several times arent we lucky that we live in such in this modern day world
after waiting for several months season is finally getting underway with more intrigues suspense unexpected twists and turns subplots all the things that make downton abbey a program that keeps one anxiously awaiting the next episode although ive only been able to watch the first episodes of season it hasnt failed tailed to keep me on the edge of my seat wondering what is going to happen among the inhabitants of the abbey both aristocrats and downstairs servants theres plenty of exciting things going on among the abbeys residents the addition of shirley maclaine as lady granthams american mother stirs up plenty of new excitement and contention among the family with her sarcasm and disdain for the stuffy ways of the english aristocracy although she proves to offer a novel solution to the granthams spur of the moment dinner party disaster lady mary continues to be headstrong and even takes a stand against her mother when downtons future seems doomed offering a glimpse of just how deeply english tradition is ingrained in some of the granthams despite a seemingly hopeless future for their privileged way of life lady judiths husband finds an unexpected ally among the blue bloods when he returns for marys wedding things take an ugly turn between former allied trouble makers downstairs and keeps the suspense up between obrien and the duplicitous footman she once plotted with to wreak troubles amid those in service as well as the grantham family ediths role as spinster is finally resolved maybe im not saying any more just watch and you will find the season to continue offering excitement that keeps you impatiently waiting for the next episode all the things that made the first two seasons entertaining continues right on with new and unexpected story lines in season 
i love this series i give it a the characters are wonderful the acting is superb not only in season but in all three seasons cannot wait until season in january 
fascinating to see how they manage with cultural change from pre world war class system through the s and on 
in this sad world today i am so thankful i have found this series this series will not only keep you on the edge of your seat but will make your heart very glad with the ending of each episode for every season you owe it to yourself to see all the glamor and heartheak and joy this family carries with grace and dignity and please do begin with season one i am so happy i have found this wonderful story it makes me feel so very happy what a wonderful series 
both my wife and i enjoy the show i am a sci fi action comedy movie lover but i can sit down and enjoy watching this with her its a great period piece with historically accurate events that take place in the story so it really draws you into what is happening at the abbey 
to me downton abbey is a cool version of pride prejudice yes its a lot of relational drama but its done so incredibly well and to me more interesting in comparison to pride prejudice as a guy pride prejudice seems to be a bunch of women walking around talking thats it downton abbey is different in that it shows whats going on in the servants area as well as with the lords and ladies and the plot and character development is even better season continues this trend and doesnt let up the issues that began in previous seasons are continued some finalized and new interesting issues arise the acting character development and plot development continue to be top notch im looking forward to finishing this season and waiting on the next a note about the tv pass i think its worth it if youre a huge fan of the series and could be considered a discount from having to purchase an entire season later but its not an incredible deal a little bit of a deal but not spectacular 
this show is addicting cant wait to see what season holds for us really want to know who will be getting married 
i cannot wait until the next season to come out i watched them all so far and the last season leaves you wanting more 
i cant even say how much i liked downton abbey its even better than the old masterpiece theatre series upstairs downstairs if you like english drama you will love this 
warning a minefield of spoilers downton abbey is addictive especially if you opt for the britisn version not the somewhat dumbed down version edited for american tastes the saga of an aristocratic british family in the years just before and after the first world war its a gorgeous look at the fashions morals social distinctions and events of the era sometimes its a little overwrought but when youre watching you get so caught up its all good season one introduced us to the earl of grantham his wife and mother his three daughters the various servants and matthew crawley the new heir to the estate season two revealed the on again off again love affair between matthew and daughter mary season was even better and kept us enthralled with what those crawleys were up to now we were happy in our little fools paradise until that last episode matthew crawley is like one of those good news bad news jokes downton abbey is entailed that means it can only be inherited by the closest living male relative to the current owner thats good news for matthew turns out hes the only living heir the bad news the family thinks hes a dork the good news they have a beautiful daughter named mary matthew likes her a lot bad news she thinks hes a major dork good news she suddenly has a change of heart bad news because if she marries matthew the state passes to her son and stays in the family good news she changes her mind bad news its too late matthew has met someone else even though he still loves mary it goes on and on and on this way wwi intervenes and poor matthew is mia and then found twice hes killed in action at least once but voila its a mistake hes fine ooops no hes seriously wounded but he recovers one problem gets settled and another appears the estate is bankrupt and then a timely inheritance makes it solvent again finally in season all the problems seem to be sorting themselves out and despite one heart breaking family tragedy we are smiling through our tears watching that final season episode we are lulled into a false sense of security and thats when the writers stick a shiv into our hearts not fair not nice and not fair i would be devastated but i have one desperate hope left matthew has been put through the wringer for all seasons and he just keeps coming back so i have my fingers crossed that this is going to be fixed in season even if the writers have to come up with a dallas like dream ending i dont care i just want them to fix it 
each season just keeps getting better and better i want them to go on forever the time period and the actors are just spectactular 
my family watched downton abbey seasons and over and over again because like so many we can not get enough of itcan hardly wait for season to start and on prime instant video
what a series though i felt it lacked some of the tightness of narrative of the first two seasons i still loved it
as many miniseries this one is one of my favorites i was disappointed when i couldnt see the whole series apparently there is more shows that have not yet come on tv it only stopped at season episode right in a very important part of the show 
this series is addictive it is like a good thriller that you get into and cant put down it is well written and the stories arebelievable and offer an insight into how life was like in that era of aristocracy and those of the lower classes it offeredlittle chance for a person to get out of the class they were born into it also shows the place of women before we weregranted any rights to own property and to determine our own destiny i highly recommend this series to anyone peg
well written well acted and very enjoyable even the characters i hate show redeeming qualities the class warfare of the times is very interesting to me i hated the team of obrien and thomas but i truly love pitting them against each other they are dealing with social situations that sometimes seem out of place for the time in which they are supposed to be living but maybe that is part of what makes it so enjoyable because of the show i read the history of highclere castle and delved into s history i love it when a quality show makes me interested in history enough to research and talk about how it was thank you bbc for this excellent program 
my wife and i became hooked on the series immediately after watching the first show on pbs the show is well written and full of surprises as one could expect in any life what makes this series special is the attention to detail in the day to day life of the english aristocracy and the real life prejudices against catholics some of which still exist in england today with their anti catholic laws the poor and the irish i look forward in seeing more of the series and hope it will be around for several more seasons 
cannot let the cat out of the bag things do not go the way i would write them i guess but i am hooked anyway i could not wait to see the final episodes on pbs so in one sitting i watched the whole third season i am hooked and eagerly awaiting the th season the cliff hanger on season three may be more than most of us can bear these folks are a part of our lives now and we will never want it to end what an awesome series and the actors may want to get on with their other lives but we hope not 
watched all the episodes at one time as do not like to be continued husband enjoyed this one with me very good to the period if you have not watch do 
downton abbey season is absolutely wonderful so far i had the priviledge of traveling in the uk recently and was able to watch the original aired episodes on itv this dvd releasing in january here in the u s is the original un edited uk edition but being released by pbs and not universal pictures uk this is the u s region version playable in all u s players it is being released in january in the u s the same month that it will be airing on pbs here in the states it is currently airing in the uk on itv the first episodes so far and will be releasing on dvd in the uk by universal pictures uk on nov th so those of you with uk region players may want to consider that for all you u s dvd players this region dvd is coming jan th the excellent cast returns for another round of drama at downton youll love the new twists and turns in season you wont want to miss your chance to pick up this fanstastic season returning to downton abbey 
when reading the english reviews i realized of the brits are very disappointed in season we americans are little more forgiving thankfully im certainly not happy with the deaths of two of my favorite characters but not enough to stop watching all together im looking forward to season downton abbey is still the best dressed best acted series ive ever had the fun of watching the only flaw as far as im concerned is thomas i have never cared for the characters choice of lifestyle and could have done nicely without ever having to watch him in action i do get very tired of him always being so mean and then ending up with a promotion to a higher rank in service guess pc was alive and well back in the early s too i was thrilled to be able to purchase season before it actually played out on tv so now there will be a long dry spell before the fun begins again but owning all seasons on dvd i can always have a downton abbey marathon whenever i feel the need 
it is fantastic to have season several episodes before it finishing airing on pbs this has been a sad season so far but receiving the dvds in perfect condition made my night a bit happier 
reviewers note though i cannot promise i wont slip up this will be a spoiler free review anyone who has watched this series which i believe is basically everyone knows its sorrows joys and triumphs its an award winning itv series penned by julian fellowes that has evolved a great deal in the last three years praised for its first season but earning lackluster reviews in its second which i attribute to the time frame the series returns for a stronger but emotionally driven third season one that wouldnt be the downton abbey we know and love without some fun and soapy drama and theres plenty of it it has been many months since the house of downton abbey has seen such life and happiness as that of the impending wedding of mary michelle dockery and matthew dan stevens butler and stickler of the rules carson jim carter couldnt be more proud if mary were his own daughter always his favorite carson would do anything to see to it that mary and his employer lord grantham hugh bonnville receive only the best care and are never subject to scandal cora elizabeth mcgovern and the family couldnt be more delighted that mary and matthew are finally marrying after a tumultuous relationship and for once cora and her mother in law countess grantham maggie smith agree on something the big day isnt complete without the arrival of coras opinionated and bossy american mother shirley mcclain and coras youngest daughter sybil jessica brown findlay who created waves of conflict in the family when she married the chauffer tom allen leech accepting a tradesman for a son in law soon becomes second to the dreams of edith laura carmichael becoming a journalist the arrival of new downstairs staff thomas shenanigans scary possibilities for mrs hughes phyillis logan and financial woes for downton abbey what makes this series such a success is its characters its been said time and again by reviewer after reviewer and its true the foundation would simply crumble without them its the things that we laugh cry and bite our nails over that makes downton so distinctively what it is three years in that is still the key to why this is so darn successful and i am pleased to say that even entering an age of renowned promiscuity the roaring s fellowes still retains the charm and mostly wholesome ideal marvels galore from new characters and old favorites to inventive new costuming will delight devoted fans of this popular british originated and now imported american series leaving off from the second season certain characters fates were left in tatters and in jeopardy and others lives were finally getting on the track of happily ever after after much angst ill confess to reading spoilers and gossiping about this in anticipation with a couple of friends so i wasnt unprepared for anything that was happening in the stately halls of my favorite british mansion there is plenty of soapy drama mixing in with tears and lest you despair never fear there are events that make us smile and our hearts inexplicably happy ediths happiness takes a turn ripping a page straight from a bronte novel thomas and obrien continue to scheme directing hate towards each other lest you think some fan favorites are absent youd be mistaken daisy anna and bates are still a familiar presence as is isobel and even the re appearance of the fallen maid ethel new faces also become a fixture at downton between a besotted new kitchen maid and a vain footman that alone creates loads of tension some of the highlights consist of meeting coras mother she and violet are a riot together like she and isobel they are constantly at odds as well as the characters who have evolved into something more mature and if possible more wonderful being something of a romantic i wish matthew and mary had shared more intimate moments of flirting and stolen kisses but being the proper british couple they are that is kept to a minimum but seriously as my mother said even when theyre fighting they are cute she is so right their interaction is darling and all too rare everything from the motor cars to the scenery the grandeur of a london club to the costuming is gorgeous and beautifully puts us in mind of this era i love the production for that reason alone if nothing else though there are many other reasons with rumors that some of the main cast nooo please say it isnt so is leaving and no report that there will be a fourth series yet i can accept this ending but am wishing that we will be granted another series beyond just the upcoming christmas special so many moments were precious including the acceptance of tom loved roberts shifting attitude and memories were made that we will no doubt cherish all of which is carried by the phenomenal cast and the emotional witty script perhaps its not as brilliant as when it first debuted though far be it from me to judge but fellowes is on the right track and for me downton abbey won my heart over anew downton abbey premieres in the u s january on masterpiece theatre copyright dreaming under the same moon scribbles scripts and such
you will not be sorry purchasing this season of downton abby shirly maclain guest stars and is so funny as the american this show was shocking this year i believe you will love it 
what can one possibly say for the best british tv series ever done especially dont miss then get caught up with this one i hear that that making another one 
what a great series loved every single episode it is a nice change from all the same mundane tv shows downton abbey great show 
just keeps getting better the only down side to downton abbey is that there are very few episodes for each season series but it does create anticipation 
this is the best series on television i find so little to watch on the major networks i was delighted when i discovered this fabulous show on amazon prime over the course of a week a watched the first two seasons and the first episodes of season like a good book i dont ever want the episode to end i truly have become addicted and many of my friends have as well during these cold dark days of winter it was a great respite and i felt transported right into downton abbey how great to leave my cares and worries behind 
downton abbey and its inhabitants both noble and servile is back to normal life after world war i however this does not mean their lives are without trials and tribulations joys and devastation personal problems overwhelm the characters triumphs bring them joy and satisfaction however the post war world is starting to change and the aristocratic lifestyle of downton abbey is starting to show signs of crumbling as in the other seasons of this epic drama the characters are well defined and realistic the photography exquisite and full of expression and the costuming breath taking gifted actors speaking well written sometimes ironic dialogue make this another season to watch ravenously 
cant stop watching it i know what everyone was talking about when they told me i should watch it solid plot great characters and just so enjoyable 
there has never been a series that come comes close to downton abbey best series ever made i have watched seasons and two times through and have already watched shows twice each cant get enough of it 
its is the best television series i have ever watched cant wait for next season have told all my friends about it 
the character development in this series is excellent in addition the historical representations are accurate and interesting i learn new things about the era with nearly every episode 
so happy with this option of viewing downtown abbey instead of having to wait for a month and its a great show 
totally obsessed love english mini series all together i watched it on tv also and love it cant get enough
the characters are intriguing and engaging the writers make the ever changing plot grab and hold your interest i always want more 
i have watched downton abbey from the very beginning the work is so good and the actors and actress are so very outstanding that one feels likethey are right there with everyone however i am upset about the amount of people that are being killed off william lavinia syble and now mathew to say nothingof poor pamouk and vera as well as cora losing her baby so i am wondering how many and who will be next in season if there is one i had wondered how they were going to get bates outof prison never thought it would be as simple as a pie a pie would never get one off in this country but it is fantasy to begin with however a lot ofresearch must have gone on about that time of life being of irish decent myself i could sympathise with tom especialy my ancesters are from northernireland which is still under british rule however it was done it is an excellant piece of work and the person that said the u s should take a lesson fromthe brits in making movies that needs no sex or violence was so right amazon has done an excellant job in getting downton abbey to the public in a timely manner i have no complaints about their product i love my kindle fire 
the commercial reviews say its about rivalries and jealosies and such and nothing could be further from the truth its a character study of many different people all at the same time like life is the characters are multi dimensional unlike most of the silly predictable rot that is mass manufactured for todays audiences there have been a couple silly things like patrick coming back from the dead then disappearing again and the convenient death of matthews intended but for the most part the story is gripping 
beautifully done and the script keeps you coming back for more the drama is not made up hollywood drama it feels more like real life drama with normal real life reactions i could listen to the opening music all day and i check my kindle every morning for a new episode 
of all the bbc drama and period films and movies downton is by far the best in every catagory i only wish theyd continue producing more of it and i wish the old man writer who dreams these things up from his bathtub would ask me for advice on another story line episode nevertheless continue downton at all costs the american people will surely keep supporting it with their dvd sales and lastly try to merge the series now into the wwii time frame 
i understand that this is over but really how can they after that series finale this show has been the best entertainment in television that i have seen in so long it breaks my heart to think they are all gone now i have so looked forward to each episode more than any other show on television i am in mourning 
of course wed seen it on pbs but it was so good not only outstanding actors perfectly cast and a beautiful production location costumes everything was perfection but the writing was excellent too enjoyed watching it again saw things we hadnt seen before well undoubtedly watch it again and order the next season when it becomes available 
i am fascinated with history downtonabbey is well acted and completely true to the time period i cant think of anything i am disappointed in except for the fact that i have to wait a week for the next episode i truly hope it lasts at least until if not beyond 
there is a tendency for sequels and follow ups to lose punch as time goes on stories get worn out and stale but that is not the case here the writers take tips from history and real life to keep things interesting they do a great job of showing life from such widely different points of view that are somehow connected if you get tired of the splendor of downton you are wisked away to scotland and that completely different culture and landscape you really get a sense of time flying by modernity and also standing still tradition it is such an interesting contrast if you liked the first two you will probably like this one it has enough of the original elements and cast to feel connected but enough variety and change to let you know that this is its own story the only negative i see with this is the stereotyping of americans shirley maclaines role as the loud vulgar american is over the top her maid as the forward sex hungry inappropriate progressive american is also irritating the rest of the cast is much more multi faceted than that why not give the americans their due as well anyway i cant wait for the next one 
what can i say this show is unbelievable one of our absolute favorites cant wait for all of the future seasons 
i love downton abbey dame maggie smith is one of my favorite actresses the lives of the entitled family and the lives of the servants are equally interesting i look forward to more episodes 
if you are a fan of downton abbey as i am then please do yourself a favor and rent this show the manor house based on a recreated of an edwardian household i think that you will love it it will add depth to downton http www amazon com manor house john olliff cooper dp b k x ref sr ie utf qid sr keywords the manor house
this complex production demonstrates one of the best pieces of ensemble acting out there an interesting mix of characters acting with no weaknesses engrossing plots suspense and resolutions 
i enjoy downton abbey mostly for the costumes hair setting and scenery the story line i have to admit draws me in and keeps me wanting more 
downton abbey present is the outstanding period drama and british american production created by julian fellowes unlike amcs mad men which also took america by storm a little at a time and also largely by word of mouth downton abbey which considers edwardian england the great war and its aftermath was predominantly created by native british citizens and carefully analyzes the period it covers without wholly trashing it as mad men subtly and unsubtly does s america on an episode by episode basis in an era of exploitive programs like american horror story which is as extreme as anything ever produced for television and which regularly traffics in horrific amputations sadomasochism genetic deformity and torture it is wonderful to discover a series like downton abbey which proves among other points that adults everywhere are absolutely starved for intelligent ethical and mature dramatic fare such as was regularly produced in decades past on both sides of the atlantic especially in film opening in downton abbey is the story of the aristocratic and genuinely noble crawley family who live in contented luxury at downton abbey their immense yorkshire estate and of the lives of their multitude of servants who the crawleys treat with humanity decency and respect their fairly idyllic lifestyle is rattled by the loss of the family heirs on the titanic and then the coming of the great war which turns britain and its social traditions upside down in a thousand painful ways what makes downton abbey almost radical in this age is that it refuses to denigrate the edwardian aristocracy it examines while both violet the dowager countess of grantham maggie smith and american born lady grantham elizabeth mcgovern are initially shown to be somewhat priggish and short sighted one of the themes of the program is the dual nature of most men thus homosexual footman thomas rob james collier is along with ladys maid miss obrien siobhan finneran initially something of a villain but as the series progresses even sociopathic thomas is shown to have or to develop a good side likewise overlooked middle sister lady edith laura carmichael foolishly betrays her elder sister mary michelle dockery but this action is shown to be a lapse if still a serious one in an otherwise good personal character as a whole downton abbey believes in the predominantly ethical and decent nature of man as such it depicts both the aristocrat and the common working man such as christ figure and valet john bates brendon coyle whose performance dominates the first season as capable of integrity empathy courage nobility of purpose and basic human goodness in all its forms it is this vision of mankind that gives downton abbey its power though the series has the occasional weak treatment of a plot thread such as dignified butler carson jim carter being revealed to have once been a vaudeville performer or the rather unconvincing return of an heir thought dead downton abbey usually steers clear not of soap opera cliches unfortunately but of the standard melodramatic treatment of them when they do appear for downton abbey to continue to thrive creatively however the writing has to remain focused primarily on the historical period and continue to provide viewers with a window into the past instead of becoming bogged down too heavily in the lives of the characters themselves by season three for example the lame and long suffering bates has been put through so many sensational reversals of fortune that such events no longer seem very credible and audience sympathy for the character wanes considerably in season one the various characters appeared largely to represent objective principles as much as they were presented as three dimensional human beings in the opening episodes of season three however the same characters are instead depicted strictly in human terms and the writing is far more self conscious in every respect thankfully by the fifth episode and following the writing is the best it has been since the first season downton abbey in its worldwide success should not be playing to its audience but going its own way and forcing the viewer to make all the effort necessary to follow it still downton abbey remains outstanding on almost every level from the writing cinematography set design costuming and score to the brilliant acting by hugh bonneville as the crawley family patriarch dan stevens as heir presumptive matthew crawley and smith mcgovern dockery coyle and well over a dozen others downton abbey sets a new standard for st century television and by extension asks us to reconsider the lives we lead and the society we support today all students of edwardian england of rupert brooke vita sackville west kenneth grahame j m barrie the sitwells and others will admire and deeply appreciate this intelligent thoughtful and moving series 
this series is why i watch television at all it has style dramatic tension superb acting and terrific writing i highly recommend downton abbey 
i love british shows that are clean this is a very good show with a big cast yet each character basically has its own story line which comes together to make the show well done 
downton abbey is just right for anyone this one show has enough talent for ten shows full of twists and turns limitless high level humor and romance i hope its writers never stop 
i love masterpiece theater always have this series is amazing with a richness of character development not seen in years its wonderfully written the actors are amazing with the sets and characters giving us a glimpse into a bygone era when i was a little girl we used to dress for dinner and i never really understood why now i do my parents were just trying to uphold a standard one they were not able to uphold for long ive now lived long enough to see so many standards and traditions leave for a more casual lifestyle befitting the trends of the day how interesting it is to watch a way of life ease away cannot wait for the next season why do we have to wait a full year really this is just too long what a story 
my husband i both adore downtown abbey the people are portrayed as real people with difference beliefs and most are good and it is injoyable because most are working hard to do the right thing the crawley family are smart and humane and care for everyone the costumes and settings look real down to the last detail its a joy to watch all seasons 
like most of the free world i love downton abbey i love pbs always have this program just leaves me begging for more i went through all of the eipsodes of season for most of a full day and now cant wait for the next season and there had better be one maggie smith as well as all the major players are superb i firmly believe this program is so popular due to the fact there is so little quality programs being produced these days ones that dont involve sorid explicit depraved acts violence language etc i and apparantely many more crave a show with class about class and what it means to have class manners and class in my humble opinion went out the window decades ago im just saying but long live downton abbey and maggie smith 
excellent script acting directing location classic english drama i feel like i am peeking into a window watching their lives unfold 
oh i forgot excellent historically correct references to then current events done subtly so as not to distract or preach what else is there 
this is bbc at its very best i used to watch upstairs downstairs decades ago this is similar the lives of the aristocrats upstairs vs the lives of the servants downstairs exceedingly well acted i am a little hearing impaired and find it hard to make out all the words because of the british accents but the dvd has english subtitles rush out and buy it i have already pre ordered the next season which will ship in feb amazon of course this is the best of the best of the best need i say more 
i have been enjoying this series since the beginning love it love it love it cant wait til it arrives when will that be 
i was asked to do this review solely on watching the preview to season of downton abbey and i wanted to take the opportunity to say what a wonderful series this is the cinematography acting storyline everything is nothing short of amazing the preview to season looks great and i look forward to when it becomes available on prime 
more video tv effort should be spent on shows like this one most commercial broadcast tv is throwaway stuff with rarely any redeeming grace i will watch and absorb this offering more than once 
this series has been a breath of fresh air from all the garbage we normally have to endure on television the cast is amazing and story lines are great i wont do any spoilers in case someone reading hasnt watched it yet but i will say this season was very rocky due to gained fame of some of the actors but im so hoping the show can hang on to the essence of downton that made us all fall in love with it from the beginning 
love it love it love it i get lost in the period in the characters i love the scenery and the story line
i am an ardent fan of downton abbey and have watched all the episodes from seasons season in my opinion is not as great as the previous two seasons primarily because i felt a lot of the subplots got resolved in a pat manner and some characters significant ones at that are killed off i wont mention which ones so as not to spoil the experience for those who are yet to watch the series but some of the actors playing these roles wished to move on to other projects and so there was no choice but to get rid of their characters i thought season was a sad season because of the war and the losses resulting from it including the death of a well liked character and some dramatic turn of events however after watching season i have to say that the current season wins hands down in being a downer bates brendan coyle who is valet to the earl of grantham hugh bonneville and is married to head housemaid anna bates joanne froggatt gets sent to prison for the murder of his first wife though he claims he is innocent for much of this season anna spends what little free time she has chasing leads to clear bates name and set him free downton is also in serious financial trouble thanks to the earl making some questionable investment choices all this and theres a wedding to prepare for the much anticipated wedding between heir matthew crawley dan stevens and lady mary michelle dockery will downton survive lady sybil is pregnant with her first child with husband ex chauffeur branson allan leech and comes to stay at downton for the wedding though later events may cause the couple to remain indefinitely at downton lady edith who is always unfortunate in matters of love thinks she may have finally found happiness but as is often the case with edith things dont always go according to plan i admit that this season does have a lot of depressing events in it but despite it all it remains a riveting and engaging watch i love how julian fellowes balances the drama of both upstairs in the earls family as well as the politics of downstairs mrs hughes phyllis logan suffers a medical scare mrs patmore finds romance and footman turned valet thomas barrow rob james collier displays his sensitive side there are some interesting developments among the staff but one can always rely on butler mr carson jim carter to remain steadfast and stodgy dame maggie smith who plays the formidable dowager countess grantham is amazing as usual and has some of the best lines in the show she delivers them with such panache and is definitely one of the stars of the show i think she is indispensable to the shows continued success and is certainly one of the main reasons why i adore the series so much the sets costumes and cinematography remain as exquisite as ever and though i could have done with a little less soap opera and bad news this season i still would not trade downton abbey with anything else on tv at the moment 
my husband and i got interested in this show thru amazon reviews i reaserched it on amazon after receiving email notices about it from them we have never seen it on tv and do not want to we have season i and season ii and watch them often we have season iii preordered we will continue to buy them as long as they are made we love this show it is well done well written and well acted the hillbilly humor cracks us up because we know that there are people and situations like that in everyday life rylan fears nothing and no one but the show is true to reality so he makes mistakes and gets his butt kicked from time to time great balance of humor and drama high praises to all involved with this show please keep doing what you do its appreciated 
its hard to find a good series these days but this is one of them it was well worth watching 
i was really looking forward to seeing this show i was at the movies and a preview of justified came on i immediately set my cell phone to alert me at the time and day that the show was to air i love this show but i love timothy olyphant so much that i could sit and watch an hour of him drinking a glass of water and i would give it stars seriously the show is good the whole concept of the us marshall that is not gun shy at all is pretty funny the transformation of boyd from white supremisist killer to man of god is great and boyds relationship with his father is pretty cool i like the prison scene when you first meet boyds dad that was awsome over all i thought this show was great and i look forward to season i am definately buying this on dvd the last episode of season wow that was worth it all man i cant wait to see how it all continues 
i dont care for of the cop or crime drama shows on tv dont like westerns and think folks put too much emphasis on certain actors having said that i love this show casting did an excellent job finding the right actors for respective parts and the multiple stories spanning the entire season and within each episode are all excellent season was so good i had to wonder how long they could keep it up looks like they made it to about episode of the new season before things went a bit off track edit i watched season again nuttin else on tv and for some reason i thought the second half of season episodes were better than i remember em being first time around i also finally got around to watching all the extras on the dvds bout all of em were pretty good ive been so disappointed in movies lately that i rarely go they confuse motion with action but one thing i really miss is soundtracks newer movies went south long before the soundtracks season has a great soundtrack and i dont care for country music i had to go hunting for the music but heres a few ive found all of which i think can be sampled at amazon mp site episode title in parenthesis say ho by phase fire in the hole opening scene someday ill be forgiven for this by justin townes earle fire in the hole it took a long time by koko taylor fire in the hole sans soleil by miike snow fire in the hole closing scene castleneck by cliff wagner the old riverbrook its the convict bands number ten million slaves by otis taylor blowback closing scene you left me lefty by united steelworkers of montreal blind spot stand by your man by tammy wynette hatless homesick by ryan kickland veterans it took a long time by koko taylor fathers and sons youll never leave harlan alive by brad paisley bulletville closing scene season little lovin by lissie music from season trailer heathens kiss by horsefeathers the moonshine war surreal opening scenes montage harlan county line by dave alvin the i of the storm through it all by leftover cuties blaze of glory ending chase scene anabelle by gillian welch reckoning surreal funeral scene montage i gave season to a relative that normally would not give a show like this a second glance and they blew through all episodes in short order 
i love love this show have always admired tim love this part for him you have excellent writers actors plots i have now caught up on season can hardly wait for new season you have a permanent fan here hoping you keep winona raylan together love him in love like boyd ava together too keep up the great work my only wish is that i could see a filming of this show should have a contest i do live in la area have several friends family members who also love this show 
this has become my favorite series to premier in and the whole cast was excellent and the stories were riveting the over arching story is still a bit of a mystery since you cannot tell what side his dad is on other than his own if you dont like this you dont like drama i would tend to say but it does have a back home feel to it that i tend to enjoy in his relationships stars easy 
timothy olyphant is perfect in his roll as marshal rayland givens the stories are interesting the characters believable the episodes all tie in together but you can still watching them individually and still be able to follow the story along im really loving this show and im so glad that amazon allows me catch up from the beginning 
justified is a gem of a series the first episodes were outstanding across every measure used for such things searcy goggins olyphant zea and the other actors are wonderful this series is unique it is like nothing else on tv if youre tired of watching the usual tank topped stereotyped females and truly boring cut from the same mold male actors watch justified its fans are impatient for season to begin in the meantime i have ordered season on dvd from amazon to enjoy 
season one starts with raylan in miami his work takes him back to his old stomping grounds of kentucky there raylan meets up with his dad a convicted criminal with whom raylan shares no love and his old buddy justified is the perfect name for the series marshal givens always feels hes justified in doing whatever is required to get the job done season one is only a teaser for many better seasons to come 
justified is the story of deputy u s marshal raylan givens we quickly learn a couple major facts about raylan in the pilot when he shoots a miami cartel captain in a crowded restaurant and is subsequently re assigned back to eastern kentucky as punishment raylan isnt afraid to use his gun and he has serious issues with his hometown justified is a modern western and more serial drama than procedural the pilot is based on elmore leonard short story fire in the hole and it shows one of the greatest tv pilots ive ever seen its like an entire novel in minutes the title justified refers to the justification for the various shootings raylan is responsible for raylan givens is not a cop willing to step over any line for professional or personal reasons a la vic mackey true to the title of the show his shootings are always legally justified but while they keep to the letter of the law they surely do not keep to its spirit in the very first scene of the series the miami cartel captain that raylan shoots only pulls first because raylan has promised to kill him and the deadline is seconds away was it really justified to shoot a man after giving him hours to leave town or die even if he pulled first but raylan is a man with a code explored most searchingly in the hammer raylan may make it look it but his is not as easy road as rachel finds out in long in the tooth and judge mike the hammer reardan finds out in the hammer other major themes are family and raylans nihilism the empathy he has for his adversaries serves him as well as his quick trigger finger justified is full of the witty dialogue for which leonard is known raylan boyd and ava are all wonderfully well drawn raylans co workers tim and rachel suffer from a lack of attention but are compelling to the extent possible given the limited attention they are given raylans boss art his ex wife winona and her new husband gary are all dimensional minor characters like many drama series today justified attempts to balance between more traditional procedural episodes and episodes that directly tie into a larger season long narrative arc much like terriers another underappreciated serial drama on fx season one of justified sets up the season long arc in the pilot pulls away from it for one off episodes in rest of the first half of the season then returns to it in the second half of the season building to a season finale climax it comes off a bit clumsy everywhere i have seen it done but justified pulls it off well enough the state of kentucky is a character in justified this is not a story that could have taken place anywhere but just happens to be set in kentucky it is at its heart a story about kentucky and specifically eastern appalachian coal mining kentucky it could not have been set anywhere else the driving force of the show is not raylans conflicts with lawbreakers but his inner conflict from being pulled in one direction by his family and his roots and another by his morals and his chosen life unlike most movies and tv shows the southern accents sound right perhaps its not surprising as walton goggins boyd crowder was raised in georgia and nick searcy deputy chief nick mullen is from the mountains of north carolina dvd extras the commentary sometimes veers into elmore leonard hero worship and mutual backslapping and inside incomprehensible jokes but it is nonetheless laden with golden nuggets of insight in particular about the adaptation of the leonard short story fire in the hole for the pilot dvd extras include commentary on fire in the hole blowback hatless and bulletville what would elmore do the story of justified meet the characters of justified shooting for kentucky the marshals long hard times to come music video season a look ahead and previews from justified season cut entirely from season clips community the bridge on the river kwai and red hill 
justified is a tv series about u s marshall raylan givens a character created by elmore leonard and is expanded from his short story fire in the hole while the premise of the show seems by the numbers it carries itself in a unique direction away from the usual crime series after a shooting in miami marshall raylan givens is reassigned to his hometown in harlan county kentucky the series progresses in an episodic manner as we learn more about raylans background and about the people he runs into on the job these episode to episode plots may not sit well with some viewers accustomed to long story arcs but the writers of this series keep things on an unpredictable level and i found each stand alone episode engaging and watchable it also helps that though we do get some exposition on his co workers the stories are wisely centered on raylan himself hes a great character to watch and the writers never forget that the shows about him speaking of the writing the dialogue of this show is very sharp theres still gun fire aplenty in each episode along with some well staged shoot outs but its the dialogue that moves the plot along i really cant say that about any other crime show and thats really what makes justified stand apart from the rest the dialogue of course wouldnt work as well as does if it didnt have terrific actors to deliver it timothy olyphant proved in deadwood that he had the acting chops to carry his own show and he towers above all in justified equally good is walton goggins who more or less seems the shows chief antagnost its the crossroads that these two characters come to that electrifies this seasons final episodes this first season dvd comes with a decent amount of extras the cast talking about their characters is nothing new to people whove been following this show online but the commentaries on select episodes are pretty good with insights not only into the stories and characters and the influence by elmore leonard but the little details about the real u s marshals while justified probably wont be everyones taste i recommend everyone give it a try with so many shows on networks recycling the same formula from sopranos or the shield its nice to see a series like justified taking things in a slightly different direction its clever funny exciting and unpredictable and will keep you wanting for the next season 
thrilled that it has been renewed for season favorite tv show this whole year timothy olyphant has been great in everything ive seen of his and walton goggins is new to me and was brilliant looking forward to seeing the dvd extras marshal raylan givens timothy olyphantboyd crowder walton goggins chief deputy art mullenava crowder joelle carterwinona hawkins natalie zeajohnny crowder david meunierbo crowder m c gaineyassist us atty vasquez rick gomezdewey crowe damon herrimanarlo givens raymond j barryhelen givens linda gehringerpilar miami cartel alexandra barreto
for anyone looking for a somewhat different but well acted and well produced crime series this is a good one timothy olyphant is excellent as the lead but the entire cast does a great job each episode furthered the development of the characters and the story line and im looking forward to season two highly recommend 
i tuned into justified last march after reading a favorable critics review just before it premiered on fx and have been hooked ever since its my favorite show best since sopranos and if youve never seen it do yourself a favor and give it a look the writing some of which is based on the work of the great elmore leonard is exceptional and the acting is topnotch shining as bright as the lawmans star he wears is timothy olyphant so perfect as deputy u s marshal raylan givens that after viewing a few episodes its hard to imagine anyone else in the role olyphant brings givens to life as a heroic yet very human character whos as likeable as they come hes surrounded by a great supporting cast not the least of whom is walton goggins as raylans nemesis boyd crowder all thirteen episodes of the inaugural season are worth watching with some being especially noteworthy the pilot is outstanding introducing the players with the emphasis on givens and exploring some of what makes him tick while also leaving some unanswered questions about this most interesting character episode is a personal favorite of mine focusing on raylans pursuit of a fugitive and featuring a really neat desert showdown between our hero and a couple of hitmen some of the episodes can stand on their own while others are more serialized but whatever your preference the more you watch the more you cannot wait to see what happens next justified has drama and action romance and laughs and overall its a real dandy of a show that is well worth watching i recommend it highly 
timothy olymphant is deputy us marshal raylan givens a dedicated marshall who is also a fast draw when he has to be he is rotated back to take a duty posting in his home state of kentucky a decision that he isnt right fond of but soon discovers there is plenty of cleaning up to do in kentucky that requires his own particular style ive watched season one from the pilot all the way through the season finale ill straight up say that justified is quality tv entertainment take the modern adult oriented police procedural and combine it with a classic tv western and theres your justified the cast is strong big time strong olymphant just rolls right along with the lead part but hes surrounded by a supporting cast and guest cast that just immerse the viewer favorites include nick searcy as art mullen chief deputy a relatively easy going boss until you get him riled and raymond j barry arlo givens raylans father who has a big time checkered past and we as viewers still dont know it hell ever be on the level with his son i wont even get into the woman cast members but suffice to say they all kick you know what and take big time names aunt helen who is now married to arlo and played by natalie zea is a tough protective sort who brandishes a shot gun like every other episode and im surprised she hasnt hauled off and shot someone yet and that one truck doesnt count as she was at a distance the show also has its own laid back humor which is awesome there is such as thing as a show taking itself too seriously and thankfully justified gives us the best of both worlds the set locations are a combination of modern housing backwoods country housing and rough and tumble hill country the viewer is immersed in the locations and the show through the characters as we are shown where they live as for the old west tv meets modern police show three of the main cast members were trapped in a backwoods cabin while the bad guys peppered it with automatic weapons fire during the season finale how many time have we seen that scene in past westerns and you cant get more old west then that as usual justified had its own take on the situation and that rocks out if you like the police procedural ensemble cast shows or might want to check out a show centering on a modern us marshals office in the kentucky hill territory then i recommend the dvd set of the first season of justified 
absolutely the most au courant use of the old west theme in a long while even the boldly compelling mongrelization of gangsta rap and blue grass music which introduces each episode infuses the watcher with a proper disposition to build rapport with the essence of this series walton goggins is the perfect antagonist gone good to olyphants walkin the edge of the law marshal now thats what i call a paradoxymoron well anyway one of the best shows on tv at this time and that aint no shinola 
i think this was a first good season i think timothy olyphant did a good job with the character the show has humor action actual plot that makes sense i love the shows that fx has their series are worth watching timothy olyphant ive seen him in movies but this series has me becoming a fan and im looking forward to season tonight ps the character dont remember his characters name but he was on the shield i love how he plays bad there are some actors who are meant to play bad guys and who are so good at doing it thumbs up 
some nitwit i work with has absconded with my season one and im going to push him down in the flume if he doesnt return it soon this sets the tone for the whole series you just dont know whats coming next but raylan always warns you twice that one episode where ferris buehllers friend cameron is a dentist and freaks out on a smart ass patient and goes nuts and pulls his teeth out in a parking lot with a pair of pliers well its just over the top its like that all the time 
justified is a modern western set in eastern kentucky based on the works of elmore lenoard its without a doubt the best written show ive seen in timothy olyphant plays the lead character a modern us marshall dealing with the lawlessness of a rural kentucky he thought he had left behind raylan also has to deal with his criminal father friends he grew up with who went criminal ex wives and so on the father does an especially good job the plots often have twist endings which are well thought out olyphant plays his character perfectly the only downside for me was that the final episode was too over the top there was too much unrealistic violence and outright nonsense it also kind of dug a hole in terms of where they can go next season but the quality of nearly all the other episodes makes up for its flaws 
fx just keeping making more and more great television shows timothy olyphant was awesome in deadwood and he is just as good in justified i have directv and an hddvr so i record and watch every episode new shows are starting this january by the way i am not very good at describing things so writing a review is hard plus i dont want to ruin the show for anyone but i highly recommend this show if you enjoy shows like the shield which also aired on fx the show has a great cast along with good directing and story lines i cant wait for season to start 
being a fan of hbos deadwood and liking timothy olyphant in the role of seth bullock i tuned into justified the first night it aired on fx this is the role he was born to play as marshal raylan givens he kills one bad guy too many or too quickly then gets sent to the backwoods of kentucky where he grew up to lay down the law his own way there he encounters an old crush his ex wife his criminal father his childhood friend who has become a racist and murderer played wonderfully by walter goggins and a whole slew of memorable weirdos the show has just the right amount of gritty violence and occasional humor to go along with the sometimes overly simple and often familiar storylines but even that cant take away from the coolness and charm olyphant injects into this shoot first ask questions later cowboy definitely one of my favorite new shows 
just to let you know i am not a fan of weekly shows on television everytime you get to watching a show it disappears got hooked on human target on blu ray and started watching it on tv yet fox keeps movingit around to variable nights and times where i just quit watching it ill wait for season two blu ray back to justified this is an amazing transfer on blu ray for a television show never cared much for fox and its affiliates like fx because they broadcast in low res p got this blu ray under bucks great price for a whole season and was really captivated by the clarity and detail of the image no grain no dirt full of bright colors it is hard to believe a television show can look this good i am sure it has to do with the resolution now being p instead of p glad i didnt settle for the dvd instead was thinking its tv how good can it look and boy did i make a good choice spend the extra few bucks to get this blu ray besides the shows pretty good too looks like i will be watching season two even though its only p im hooked on this show 
this is a really great new show it has a unique twist on mystery crime they built the characters right from the first episode and made even the worst of them slightly likeable so many shows these days have no likeable characters even the good guys are jerks not flawed like regular people but absolute jerks this show found a a way to make the good guys be flawed but good hearted and the bad guys less unlikeable but bad guys the story lines are interesting setting is unique and its funny in subtle ways that make the hour fly by 
im late to the dance with this great tv show but love it everything about this show is excellent tim olyphant reminds me of a young clint eastwood dont want the show to end but wish great things for him 
i have to confess that i was not that impressed by justified at the beginning the first few episodes were good but it did not at the out start have a compelling long term arc or rather didnt obviously have one i simply wont watch shows that dont tell an overarching story over the course of the series nothing makes me lose interest in a show more quickly than a succession of stand alone episodes which is one reason that i have virtually no interest in pre television with rare exceptions like the prisoner and tinker tailor soldier spy and the twilight zone and monty python but with the gradual development of long story arc television in the eighties tv transformed from a media that i had virtually no interest in to one that i prefer strongly over the movies and this from someone who ran a couple of film societies in grad school so my fear was that justified was going to be a series of standalones but luckily it developed a great ongoing storyline with a surprisingly likable cast the writing for the show wasnt quite as sharp as for shows like the shield and the wire but it was strong by the standard of most shows and the cast was exceptional i had always wanted to see timothy olyphant in another story after the prematurely cancelled deadwood in which his extraordinary performance was sometimes overlooked by a host of equally strong characters here olyphant comes into his own and his portrayal of raylan givens made him perhaps the most enjoyable lawman on television at the moment wayne goggins proved in the shield that he was one of the best actors on television and he proves it again here in this one as an exceptionally complex southern redneck who is in turn a white supremacist criminal drug dealer religious zealot and reformer even at the end of the season it is hard to classify him as a good or bad guy a lesser actor might not be able to pull it off but goggins nails it my recommendation for anyone who tries this but isnt immediately delighted with it give it a chance it will definitely repay your interest and im sure that most viewers will enjoy raylan givens as much as i do 
im a southerner so may be biased but raylans character is the perfect hero boyd is the best antagonist ive been a fan of timothy oliphant quite a while but walton coggins is new to me im enthralled the series has many many great characters check it out the product itself is brand new was delivered as advertised 
i have watched this show from the pilot all the way thru to episode each episode has been awesome and leaving me wondering what was going to happen next i do not watch a lot of tv but this is a show worth your time it is well written and all the actors that play these characters have them portrayed dead on perfect i have to admit i love westerns and miss them being on tv but justified is not a western raylan givens is an old school lawman in modern day times and his way of law is black white and timothy olyphant plays that character as if his birth certificate said raylan givens i am so glad fx picked up this show for a second season and i was hoping the fist season would come out on dvd this show deserves a bunch of awards and i hope to see it nominated you wont go wrong with this dvd ive seen the first episodes and cant wait to see and im sure the finale will be a huge cliff hanger leaving us to wish march getting here soon so we can see what happens next of all the junk that is on tv timothy olyphant and fx have given us true entertainment in justified dont miss out 
as a heartbroken fan of nip tuck which just ended its season run i was keeping an eye out for another fx show i could enjoy with fx original series can be either hit nip tuck dirt or miss the riches justified is a show i normally wouldnt have looked at even once being a city girl at heart im not a fan of westerns or anything country one thing i am a fan of is timothy olyphant when i saw one of my favorite actors brilliant in hitman was going to be in a new show i of course had to watch a pleasant surprise awaited me its as if timothy olyphant was born to be us marshal raylan givens a good ol country boy with personal issues after shooting a man in miami old west style it was justified raylan is punished by being sent back to his old home town in kentucky to work the local cases many involving people he knows his estranged father former best friend turned criminal an old flame and a complicated ex wife round out the engaging cast of colorful characters raylan has a reputation for being a bit trigger happy a branding he hardly thinks is fair only if its justified he is never without his gallon hat unless someone steals it he can talk down a hostage situation with whiskey and a bucket of fried chicken or shoot a guy for taking one more step its all in a days work for raylan justified is one of those shows that makes you forget youre watching a show being acted by actors its as though you are observing actual people live their lives i feel like im in the scene watching everything unfold before me the dialogue is fresh gritty real and absolutely hilarious the characters bounce between utterly ridiculous and completely relatable and the actors everyone from the main stars to the day players are right on the money if you havent yet seen justified do yourself a favor and catch it when it re airs on fx watch it on demand or wait for the dvds to come out if you dont give this show a chance well that aint civilized 
well it is set in eastern kentucky rather then in sparta mississippi still justified is bound to resonate with any fan of the groundbreaking in the heat of the night series small town in a big world problems being solved creatively in minutes or less but without the annoyingly preachy tone that in the heat of the night would sometimes assume a definite positive youll have fun making character comparisons between the two shows can you find a bubba how about a luanne let me first note that justified is a very new show so far only six episodes have been aired however the episodes carry such an unusually high degree of promise i feel confident rating the series even at this early stage with the top score the story is simple deputy u s marshal raylan givens timothy olyphant brings too much negative attention to himself by killing one miami thug too many he is therefore relegated to a remote post to cool his heels unfortunately for raylan the post happens to be the sleepy eastern kentucky where he grew up and hoped never to come back estranged petty criminal father an ex wife an ex flame an ex friend well they do say you can never go back home or was it you should never go back home anyway upon this background the writers skillfully project a series of surprisingly engaging multidimensional stories that go beyond catching the baddy of the week yes there is the usual parade of rednecks and i hope well get to see more eccentric types as time progresses but often the baddies are portrayed as flawed human beings making some very poor choices all while doing their best to survive in this world and that does have the effect of bringing them into conflict with the law also satisfying is the way the writers choose to characterize raylan he is not some cartoon super hero using secret kung fu moves to dispatch his enemies instead he is a humble man still dealing with emotional ramifications of his divorce and still conflicted in his relationship with his father occasionally he allows his foes to gain the upper hand and rob him of his car badge and gun further proving he is a real person which makes him very relatable kudos to timothy olyphant for his portrayal of givens both he and the writers have the character spot on from the first minute of the pilot to those who like action though worry not the stories never get sappy and there is plenty of creative a kicking somehow even a bazooka makes it into the script if i were forced to find a pet peeve regarding justified it would probably be the unrealistically high number of good looking people with porcelain veneers and slim waistlines the authors have inhabiting the area from my personal experience involving a five week stay in lexington kentucky the reality has fewer teeth and a much higher bmi no offence to the locals intended o and so keep this show on your radar i dont watch tv anymore i have cancelled my cable as it seems to stream nothing more then vile reality shows but am so enthused by justified that i actually pay to watch it on amazon on demand go figure 
not since the sopranos have i soaked this much enjoyment out of a television series id grown weary of cop shows and never been a huge fan of westerns so i was dubious but gave the show a chance anyway good decision this is truly a terrific show with several superior and a couple of colossal acting performances the blu ray looks great get it youll love it 
this is one of my favorite tv shows ranked right up there with breaking bad i am very happy to hear that fx has renewed the series for a second season ive been impressed with olyphant since his portrayal as seth bullock on hbos short lived series deadwood olyphant was born for the role of raylan givens ive already pre ordered season so that i can watch it all again 
justified is an fx station super channel for our canadian brethren series that began airing march so it is relatively new raylan givens is a us marshal who after a performing a justified perp pulled weapon first shooting in miami in the line of duty is relegated to harlan kentucky turns out harlan is raylans hometown seems raylan is seen as a bit of a loose canon and in an attempt to control him and also lessen his impact on the reputation of the us marshal services they send him somewhere they think he cant cause much of a stir for the sake of good tv they were wrong of course every episode is nicely wrapped up in the allotted ish minutes with some story bits such as raylans father his old sweet heart and so on over arcing those over arcing bits are really just background history and so on which makes it easier for people to jump in at the middle of a season the raylan character is based on a short story by elmore leonard to yuma was another of his stories you can find it in the bookwhen the women come out to dance storiesand it is also available for free from harper collins website if you hit elmore leonards website you should be able to find the link to it amazon doesnt allow links to external sites in reviews which is why i didnt include it my focus is mainly from the blu rays technical specs and execution i like the show which is why i bought the blu ray video justified was shot using hd cameras so it almost goes without saying that it looks darn good originally i believe it aired in p but is presented here in i believe non upscaled p which means they downscale it for tv the images are bright crisp and clear with many a fine detail available in pretty much every shot no grain no dust or dirt it is encoded using avc and has no compression issues even with episodes on disc there is no evidence of compression problems in the slightest it looks great audio audio is encoded with dts hd ma there are absolutely no audio issues detectable one thing i notice however is that despite this being a mix there really dont seem to be too many detectable surround effects occasionally youll hear ambiance effects back there but not much more if youre looking for a show to give your surround system a real work out look somewhere else i assume this has to do more with being made for tv than it does with it being a problem with the masters they used for the series it sounds great but it sounds like it is mainly stereo packaging justified comes in an oversized blu ray case that has a hinged disc holder in the center it works well and does a good job of keeping the discs on the hubs even though amazon shipped my copy in a simple bubble mailer none of the discs came off the hubs in transit the front cover is pretty much all the artwork you have the back cover has the required series description and specs inside you have a small flyer for justified season and on the back another series rescue me i believe that also airs on fx packaging is acceptable but not exceptional extras you have commentary on several episodes fire in the hole blowback and hatless these commentaries are spread across the discs as the episodes in question dont necessarily fall next to one another in numerical order featurettes what would elmore do emore leonard discusses the series and the crew discuss why they like elmore the story of justified interviews with the cast focused on the show not characters i believe this was available as a behind the scenes video clip on fxs justified websitejustified meet the characters interviews with cast in regards to characters not necessarily focused on the show content again i believe this was available on fxs websiteshooting for kentucky justified is mainly shot in california how do you make ca look like ky meet the marshals discusses the history of us marshals both in real life and hollywoods perspectivelong hard times to come music video music video of the opening theme performed by gangstagrass season two a look ahead details at a high level what to expect from season the extras are all spread across the three discs in the set and while none are necessarily knock out of the park drop your jaw to the floor it really is nice to have all the extra information on the show and to learn where the directors writers cast are coming from when depicting the stories on screen good stuff all over final thoughts justified the series itself isnt entirely unique see another reviewers comparison to in the heat of the night but the stories are compelling interesting and engrossing the characters have charm and are interesting though all of them are really overshadowed by the enigma that is raylan its a great show and my current favorite tv series the blu ray is a high quality offering and something any fan of the show that has access to a blu ray player should want to have access to if you havent seen the show either you missed it or dont get fx you may want to pay for the first episode on amazons vod service if you like what you see spend the current price of the blu ray of the series and enjoy the first episode really sets the mood of the show and if you enjoy it you will almost certainly enjoy the remainder highly recommended from a content the show is good perspective and also from a blu ray extras video audio quality perspective 
the entire cast is woven into the fabric of the story plot locations in a way that we as interested viewers can see the story unfolding and sense a direction the last episode tied all the eposodes together we cant be certain if marshal raylan givens wont be transferred to a new location we know that much of the cast will be changed i am not worried i will be back to watch the next season and i will hope that the craftsmenship that the director writers and actors displayed in the first season has been included in the second season i cant recall ever seeing a group of actors work better on screen to tell an incredibly entertaining story a recent show addressed the concept that just because a person can fire an automatic weapon is not necessarily synonymous with intellegence screen writer ryan bradley mentioned that most killers arent really as smart as yet characters bad guys in this series seems to have some depth arlin for one boyd for another as for the ladies i dont know why raylan gets to be so lucky post note the two strongest episodes were the first and the last part of the direction of this series had been predicated upon the availability of the actors boyd crowder was shot chest center with a caliber slug at the end of the first show he survived it this happens in a soap opera when actor contracts or schedules forces the writers to kill the actor but then for reasons not known to the rest of us to seemingly bring him or her back as a miricle in blind spot the sheriff places two rounds in a cntract killers chest after a brief period of time two minites the contract killer somehow picks up a gun and swings his arm around slowly to shoot the sheriff could be we have about minites after the blood stops pumping in bullitville boyd crowder suffers another gun shot from a hunting rifle in the chest on the left side just above the heart the shock and trauma of this round should have put him in shock if not out and out kill him this last event made me wonder if mr croggins would be returning to justified for a second season we are looking for entertainment not reality i bought the dvd and it was worth every penny cant wait for season 
this show is awesome a true tribute to elmore leanords writing on top of that timothy oliphant has swagger that makes me jealous with envy compelling script story and gritty action fill this wonder full weekly show basic idea is raylon givens is a u s marshal who after gunning down a really bad guy in public gets sentenced to service in his home place of harlan county kentucky it starts to be a bit predictable in the middle of the first season but the last few episodes tale some great turns and turns out to be a great watch 
great show have it on dvd and my ipod see something new every time i watch it funny smart well written timothy olyphants best work to date great comedic timing a natural for westerns the next clint eastwood season two should be fun to watch to see how the characters develope 
i didnt think i would like it at first but after watching the first episode i was hooked the characters are very interesting and the main character raylan is always in some kind of trouble it is funny and serious finished season and just into season they keep expanding the characters so never dull love it 
the writing and acting are simply masterful this series is truly the most compelling on tv past or present each character is complete and fully drawn with a little bad in the good and a little good in the bad all the actors are superb with the standouts being olyphant and goggins as season developed the special relationship between raylan givens olyphant and boyd crowder goggins began to unfold in unexpected and yet very intriguing ways the character of boyd was not originally intended to last a full season so the fact that the writers allowed these characters to organically develop into something much more than planned is truly satisfying for the audience and no doubt for the actors as well brilliant 
a really fantastic new series timothy olyphant leads a great cast plus a writer s crew that trusts the quality of their own productinstead of stupid cliffhangers we ll all be back for season two if it s a good show anyway and we feel satisfied after the last episode instead of annoyed 
wow a television program that treats us like adults but then its from the talented mind of elmore dutch leonard so maybe thats why the dialogue plot lines and action make it one of the best things on the small screen today marshal raylan givens is my kind of marshal one that even the bad guys can respect because he keeps his word even when hes not keeping the best of company hes back home working in kentucky and his past seems to be filled with more than a little interesting peoples and twists season one will keep you watching season two its that good theres anything but your typical tv storylines so if you cant afford cable then buy the series save yourself a bundle and sit back and enjoy if you want to find some interesting reading when youre done watching the first season then check out leonards old westerns that shaped or set the tone for much of what weve grown up with in good westerns he wrote hombe to yuma the tonto woman valdez is coming and so many other good westerns and that was before he started writing his action books and thrillers that guess what became a handful make that two handfuls of top selling movies yeah im a fan of elmore leonards and if youre watching justified then chances are you are too finally theres this watch the first season and come back and post your own review because your opinion matters too especially when it comes to shelling out dollars for a product enjoy it my friends 
this is a pretty good deal on this dvd plays very well and a blu ray player some movies i just like the own when i know im going to be watching them a lot its good to have the physical media i recommend this product
let me say right away that i am fan so if you imagine that there may be some bias about this film youll be right as much as i enjoy the work done by zack snyder and christopher nolan i am first and foremost a fan of superman the character beyond the super powers and god like awe that surrounds the character he is inherently a symbol for the potential good of the human race he represents the best of both his worlds and acts as a guide for others superman is often referred to as the constant boy scout its easier to understand when you truly see the kind of temperament and control he exhibits on a nearly constant basis when faced with adversity how easy would it be for him to destroy his opponent in the blink of an eye and yet he refrains from doing so he is a symbol for all that we can achieve good and bad in some ways he is the embodiment of hope hope for the future hope for the world and hope in our own personal lives so when i say that i am a fan i mean to say that this film held high expectations for me and i am glad to say that this film not only met my expectations but exceeded them its difficult to compare comics and movies to one another they are different animals and because of that require different things for those of you who are fans of the comics it may be best to show that this film has an extremely similar vibe to the earth one story presented a few years back it is a reboot that while fresh and rewarding for the casual viewer truly gives back to the fans its worth mentioning that i believe a movie based on a comic book should remain faithful to its original material it also needs to separate itself and be its own thing thankfully that is the case with the man of steel the nolan brothers screenplay brought to life by zack snyder is a wonderful homage to past material while remaining original in its own way the very human aspect brought to the character removes some of the awe that may separate us from him and witnessing the struggle he deals with in understanding his two sides is the needed heart thread that grounds the film the characters most of which are easily picked out by fans of the comics are played by some rather extraordinary actors and actresses you can tell by the quality of actors how serious warner bros was about making this a legitimate project i could mention each one in particular and yet somehow i feel as though it doesnt do justice to the ensemble as a whole each person fits their character in a natural way and one of the things that i found myself enjoying about the film is that not one person overshadows another they are each a piece of the puzzle that fits well into the mold another important facet to any zack snyder film is the look and feel of the film while the film itself is grounded in many ways due to the wonderful cast it is hard to forget just how magnificent this movie looks at times while each shot is truly worthy of a movie still the action scenes are the stuff of legend remember that awe i spoke of surrounding the character of superman this is where it shines snyder is able to envision superman and his battles in a way that captures the eyes and truly keeps us glued to the screen the movie has a somber low tone visually with most of the colors subdued but when given the opportunity to for action the screen suddenly shines and explodes for much of the movie i had pure goosebumps traveling up and down my spine so if there are any reservations you have about buying this film on blu ray get rid of those right now youd be doing yourself a disservice buying it on another format thankfully like the batman trilogy nolan is so well known for there are a few moments among the drama and action for humor so its not a horribly dry film without levity also the amazing hans zimmer has lent his talents to this film and truly created a soundtrack befitting the movie id like to point out that any time hans zimmer is part of a film i get a bit excited but when it was officially announced that he would do the score for this film i was eager to hear how he would pull it the movie moves seamlessly with each passing score and zimmers soundtrack only enhances the experience in this day and age i know the idea of having two options available to customers is nice in terms of dvd and blu ray format but in the case of man of steel id recommend that you buy the bundle pack yes you may not have a blu ray player but if you ever decide to get it then youll already have the blu ray copy along with the dvd one truth be told i have a hard time recommending that this movie be bought solely on dvd cause its simply too visual a movie to experience any other way than blu ray one of the best indicators i have for a film are the feelings i have the day afterwards i left my local theater following the midnight premiere and i had a hard time sleeping almost a full day later i still have a sense of excitement over the movie this film has that something truly special its not often i sit in a theater and feel like im taken back to being that same young kid who had aspirations of saving the world while wearing a cape im pretty sure im not alone in this it filled me with the awe and wonder of my childhood and left me inspired its hard to imagine a better way to pay homage to the dreams of my past than letting them breath a little bit once more in the form of a movie i can easily say that this is one of my favorite movies of the year 
i have always been a superman fan and this movie gives a great unique take on it loved the d as well very exciting and thrilling the over the top destruction wasnt a big deal for me 
it doesnt beat the christopher reeve original but then again it doesnt try to the th retelling of his origin gets a little upkeep here with excellent visuals and by far one of the better villains seen in a comic book movie not quite heath ledgers joker but by far the best version of zod on large or small screen and i love me some terrance stamp a must for comic fans and a good buy for action fans 
so this is it the moment all superman fans have been waiting for since it was revealed that dark knight trilogy helmsman christopher nolan and director zack snyder dawn of the dead unrated directors cut two disc special edition watchmen the ultimate cut were rebooting the franchise of course man of steel is better than any current standalone marvel comics movie i e captain america thor the incredible hulk or any of the iron man trilogy but the question most people may ask is is it better thanmarvels the avengers more on that in a moment anyone who knows me knows im a big supermen fan and not much of a marvel fan save for daredevil and the punisher but i can honestly say that the avengers was an excellent film the most perfect next tothe dark knight two disc special edition comic book adaptation to date when critiquing a comic book film i not only look at story acting and directing but also if the film sticks to or addresses the original material both marvel and dc comic characters origins have been retconned reimagined and rewritten so many times over the years since they first were originally introduced to the world that filmmakers have had a lot of material with which to work and while some creative license is allowed the story must stay mostly true to the comic book story and the characters have to definitely stay true to their comic book counterparts i remember seeing the original superman the movie four disc special edition starring christopher reeve and loving it i still love it to this day but that superman was one for younger and or more general audiences a tongue in cheek lex luthor his goofy bumbling sidekick otis the sexy misunderstood bad girl miss teschmacher and a lois lane who is nothing short of annoying reeves performance was excellent but as most superman fans can tell you his clark kent was the c k of old the new clark kent while still a little bit of a klutz and wearing glasses isnt quite so dorky think tom wellings portrayal from the cwssmallville the complete series also no offense to richard donners masterpiece but the film simply does not achieve the greatness of the comic and who clark kent kal el superman has become over the years since when i was a kid and a teenager i always preferred batman to superman because batman was a darker comic and darker character his parents were murdered people died the teen angst in me related to him and his plight whereas superman at the time seemed like a goody two shoes a boy scout and while he still may be that kind of superhero as ive grown my admiration for the kryptonian has grown seeing how he has more problems than one may contemplate if you were to think more about supermans plight youd see that he doesnt have it so easy either there are many philosophical complexities and moral dilemmas presented in supermans stories man of steel features all of these complexities of kal els existence the knowledge that despite his love for humans and his feeling of being one knowing he will always be an outsider check the knowledge that any time an alien comes to defeat him or make him suffer it is his mere presence on earth that brings them there so he believes any destruction or human casualty is his fault check the knowledge that any small physical reaction could lead to instant disaster and would garner great scrutiny and fear from the humans he so loves check having to truly sacrifice those he loves the most even meaning letting loved ones die for the greater good check being solely opposed to killing no matter good or evil check it has been reported that the controversy if thats what you want to call it of man of steel particularly touches on two aspects of the film one involves that last bullet point i just mentioned the other is the destruction of metropolis at the end of the film when superman henry cavill fights general zod michael shannon and his kryptonian cronies an inevitable result considering a bunch of super powered alien beings are there to take over the planet and trying to kill superman this is definitely no superman ii where superman flies away to avoid destruction and human casualties the fact that the destruction of a city is even an issue proves that critics and audiences are merely nitpicking for any negative criticism they can find was there a lot of this nitpicking when the avengers watchmen transformers or g i joe were released and that doesnt include all of the numerous alien related films where new york is destroyed did their destruction of a city sully the films worth besides if you want to get into semantics then you have to remember that superman has unlimited strength and can move at the speed of light so im sure the city could be rebuilt in no time besides if it werent for the heavy action you expect from a superman film then those same critics who are moaning about the destruction of a city would be saying how little action there was in the film remember what most people said about bryan singers superman returns two disc special edition so onto the question i originally posed is man of steel better than the avengers yes and ill tell you why basically the same type of threat that was in the avengers i e a demigod being attempting to have alien beings take over earth starting with a major city is the same threat in man of steel the one major difference the threat that took an entire superhero team and a few random regular humans to diffuse in the avengers took only one man and a few random regular humans in man of steel but its just not that man of steel takes the audience into every aspect of supermans character his birth and more background into his birth parents and home planet his formative years and his reclaiming his heritage and powers and also injects some of the new origin material that has inhabited the comics for the past few years the scope is massive and snyder pulls it off without making the audience roll their eyes to say this is not your grandfathers or fathers superman is a huge understatement man of steel introduces the audience to the contemporary superman nolan and screenwriting partner david s goyer inject more of the alien world and technology of krypton into the story which is necessary seeing how the main hero and villain s are alien kryptonian and this is an origin story the film explores both clarks farm bred past and his isolated present which is what makes the story so great unlike avengers which would not have worked if not for each character save hawkeye and black widow having their own respective movie before its release man of steel shows both kal el and zods background almost making zod a character with which to sympathize in fact there is a bit of art imitating life when it comes to zods views as well as the reason behind kryptons fate but i cannot go into those points without giving away the story i believe an updated cinematic origin and retelling of superman is long overdue and nolan snyder and company have greatly succeeded the acting is well done the writing is stellar with plenty of quotable lines there is plenty of action at least enough of what a fan would expect from a superman movie and every major complexity of kal els life is conveyed in all of its bittersweet glory plus there are hidden hints at the existence of both lex luthor see the tractor trailer logos and bruce wayne see the satellite zod throws at superman what more could a true fan ask for spoiler alert some may not like the fact that lois lane amy adams finds out supermans true identity but i thought it was a breath of fresh air honestly how could a respective professional reporter like lois not tell who clark was just because of him wearing glasses end of spoiler some critics did not like the way particular characters were treated but i found all situations understandable and adding more depth to the story it should be pointed out that if nolan company did a somewhat traditional origin story the same one all audiences have seen over and over again critics and audiences alike would be quick to point it out and complain about how unoriginal and ho hum the film would be if there are two things that man of steel is not its unoriginal and ho hum these people are just overly critical blowhards who cant be pleased and for anyone who thought any part of the films story was confusing id wonder where they were coming from as i found the films story not that difficult to follow when you go to see man of steel prepare for lots of action a good glimpse at krypton a touching story and the epic beginning of a spectacular universe of characters if man of steel is the beginning franchise in what dc comics films will be offering were in for one hell of a fun imaginative heartfelt cool ride man of steel is the best big movie of the summer and the best action film ive seen so far this year 
i ordered this for my son in law he loved this dvd he said that he would buy it again amazon is always great 
i loved the christopher reeves superman growing up and now i can still enjoy superman towards the end of the movie you can see the special effect where they had christopher reeves face and cavills i must admit i was not to fond of the idea but i had to watch this one and glad i did only problem i had was i dont have a d player my next goal is to get one im glad they had the blu ray and regular dvd 
youll have to forgive me i dont gush about movies ever and i am not in the habit of rating action movies or superhero movies with stars but my choice to rate man of steel so highly is not my own well actually it is my own but it was my own several weeks ago when i saw man of steel in the cinema below is what i wrote or rather transcribed as the words flowed from my fingers through the keyboard this is a moment captured in time written several hours after i saw the film they are my thoughts on the film before i had a chance to think it over to contemplate it to read what the critics thought these were my initial feelings on man of steel wow now this is how to do a superman movie for once a film that lives up to the hype for once a film that makes superman compelling relateable and conflicted sure its nothing like the comics theres little humour less warmth and superman is given the dark knight treatment and proves that he can stand up to it unlike some other superheroes marc webb i am looking directly at you thanks for ruining the amazing spider man but the entire cast gives stunning roles crowe and costner manage the weightier bits with ease cavill is perfect mastering the human side and the super side of kal el and looking the part adams is good but feels underutilized shannon oozes menace and quivering rage and lane is great too the villains are a real menace with shannon managing to keep up with terrence stamp a very hard act to follow and the other kryptonians providing muscle and real danger for once superman feels vulnerable and weak compared to these machines of war this is superhero fighting without arrows webs batarangs or hammers this is superheroes fighting down and dirty mano el mano matrix style with less kung fu and bullet time the action is grand gritty and intense the score by hans zimmer is brilliant and blood rousing nolan appears to be keeping snyders wilder side grounded no ramping no super slow motion the result is a large sprawling and weighty superman movie where iron man was perfect popcorn marvel entertainment man of steel strives for something greater it does not always reach it but when it does the result is truly incredible this is superman stars woah check that out i really was gushing i was using all caps and exclamation marks i inserted a slightly cheesy zack snyder joke i must not have been in my right mind and i wasnt the film had overwhelmed me there was just too much to comprehend my brain was still in awe from booming zimmer music darkly comedic and completely awesome one liners gigantic all destroying setpieces and the sight of two spandex clad superheroes throwing punches that would level a city if i was to rate the film now i would probably give it stars not i see now why critical reception has been mixed there is an absence of strong female characters the plot is jumbled and does not always work what on earth was up with hologram jor el there is just too much cgi city destruction and you though transformers was bad and the casual attitude in which superheroes destroy gigantic buildings most likely killing thousands is well sickening and superman does something completely unlike superman he kills man of steel is like zack snyders a relatively simple minded affair a film where you leave your brain at the door lots of action lots of six packs a lot of punching and not many female characters and like the action is superb and intense and gritty the six packs are present the punching is awesome and the result is an epic i say this in the truest sense of the word action superhero film i repeat my praise for the actors i felt henry cavill turned in a literal towering performance michael shannon was a quivering bellowing mass of rage supermans two dads are perfect both russell crowe and kevin costner moved me to metaphorical tears with you will give the people an ideal to strive towards they will race behind you they will stumble they will fall but in time they will join you in the sun in time you will help them accomplish wonders and pretty much anything costner said seriously costner was terrific you may pine for the simplicity and the charm of superman i and christopher reeves dimple and forelock i certainly pined for the criminally underrated superman returns dont kill me for it please please please since it captured the big blue boy scout side of superman but man of steel is in a category of its own it is not a wholly seamless film it has many many problems but i ask you to overlook that and see the greatness beyond i feel the words of jor el are appropriate in describing man of steel it stumbles it falls but in time it accomplishes wonders the result is nothing short of amazing my critical rating my initial rating stars highly recommended stars p s go easy on the dislike button for my past selfs sake he didnt know what he was doing im just following orders please please

now powered by the earths yellow sun and is empowered with superabilities an enormous battle ensues between kryptons general and kal el the fate of the earth hanging in the balance what can i say this movie is mind blowing its epic its incredible so much was riding on this film to deliver a superman movie that would captivate audiences and restore the man of steel to his rightful place as king of the superheroes man of steel does just that and then some bringing with it the awesome sci fi factors of star wars to the dense storytelling of the dark knight trilogy there has never ever been a superhero movie like this before henry cavill as superman nailed the part hes a nice guy a caring guy but hes dead serious about doing the right thing and exudes the confidence that only one who has sold himself out for the good of all can portray he did something that was never done before by any other superman actor showing clark kent before he was superman or even the bumbling reporter of the daily planet im referring to the movies not smallville in fact hes this version of clark kent for nearly the whole movie you can see him making the big decisions weighing his upbringing against this new task of saving the world that was suddenly dropped on his lap you journey along with him as he wrestles with his being different and how those differences apply to not just his life but the lives of others as superman hes the superman i never thought christopher reeves performance could be outdone but henry cavill matches if not exceeds what mr reeve brought to the character cavills superman is one hundred percent devoted to staying true to who he is his abilities his upbringing his quest for truth and justice and for putting his foot down both with men and rebel kryptonians when needed i cant really comment on his reporter clark persona because thats not a big role in this movie i hope however it will be in the sequel and well see plenty of lois and clark interaction in the next one especially after the way the lois and clark relationship is portrayed in this movie youll have to see for yourself to see what i mean michael shannon as zod was crazy good the guy can act and his zod is much different than terrence stamps yes both are ruthless but whereas stamps zod was more about power grabbing and his desire to rule shannons is about giving it his all to restore the former glory of krypton at any cost even if that means eradicating all of earths population to do it the best villain is always the villain you accidently find yourself rooting for and that happened to me throughout this movie every so often i felt for zod and understood what he was trying to accomplish it made sense and made me consider that maybe if i was in his shoes i wouldve done the same thing or something similar amy adams as lois lane was a good choice i wasnt sure at first as i know amy adams as more of a happy go lucky girl from other movies far removed from the superhero genre though she was in one episode of smallville during its first season but she sold me on the part and she reminded of the lois lanes from the old cartoons warm but cut and dry funny but serious about what she does and her desire to go the distance to get a story the action in this movie was crazy huge the bar has been set so high in terms of superhero cinema in recent years and man of steel makes every superhero movie thats come before it look like a puppet show in comparison the wide scale destruction wrought by superman and zod never mind zods right hand woman faora and the other rebel kryptonians is what youd expect if people with god like powers let loose in an all out brawl across a city and the speed man the speed normally super speed is shown as either a big blur or done in slo mo with the super speedsters moving quickly while everyone else is frozen in this one you see superman et al zipping around pausing breaking sound barriers and bringing the viewer along as if were in his shoes the whole time and experiencing the thrill of super speed ourselves the way superman flies in this is unlike any other portrayal before and while i loved how he flies in the other movies and tv shows in this one he seems to hurl himself through the air at times while at others flies with precision and care the heat vision effect in this was stellar the glow beneath the skin around the eyes and to see the veins beneath its surface made it all the more menacing the super hearing and x ray vision were familiar territory to those whove watched smallville but there was no all out x ray vision where everything is dark blue and white the fighting between superman and zod was serious business and was truly a portrayal of two warriors going toe to toe and not just wrestling or tapping each other it was one crazy hard blow after another some slow some rapid even some in the sky insane so many times i was blown away and just going wow wow wow zod fought the skill of a trainer warrior whereas superman fought with brute force man of steel is a crazy good movie with a strong story an incredible cast and superhero action that has now become the benchmark for anything to follow to be honest i dont know if it can be followed hopefully in man of steel super recommended 
the best superman since christopher reeeves in s and s henry cavill really does an amazing new superman michael shannon was amazing as general zod and the surprising person that i would say stole the spotlight in many scened was the beautiful antje traue has the sub commander faora every actor was superb the special effects the score everything was jut perfect 
definitely worth watching finally another superman to replace christopher reeves henry cavill does a great job as the man of steel and a new twist on a familiar story amy adams as lois lane was also a nice change 
great extras came with the blu ray i also used the download to put the movie on my ipad and other devices i was happy with all that came with the movie and the quality was excellent 
amazing simply amazing movie this is the best of the best movies ive seen n a long time henry cavill is even better as superman then he wa as theses in immortals n it doesnt hurt if he is the cutest thing very handsome the whole cast ensemble was great i liked that the story told more about his background n his race wth russell crowe as his father wow very impressive i wl definitely b purchasing it to view anytime i want i actually watched it xs cant wait to see what the next chapter wl b 
i enjoy dc comics as well as marvel superheroes and this was one that didnt disappoint if you like superman it will be nice for your superhero movie collection 
i will preface this by saying i have never been a superman fan i found the movies starring christopher reeve silly and dated there are some movies that are timeless star wars and other that to me just come off cheesy and reek of the time period they were made in i guess it comes down to taste i know others who are staunch fans of the reeve superman films and i wouldnt try to convince them otherwise they just never appealed to me i loved this movie i loved henry cavill as superman and the story imo was very involved and a bit darker to match todays taste the special effects were top notch amy adams was adorable as lois lane and i really enjoyed kevin costner and russel crowe as kal el clarks two fathers michael shannon was a great villain who had motivation for what he was doing something i often find lacking in these super hero movies the villain often has some lame reason for chasing our hero but here it was justified i saw it in imax d and was amazed especially at the final showdown i guess it depends on your taste there were some older people in the theater i was in who left there is a lot of violence fighting in the last of the movie so if you are looking for the innocent comic book fare of the old movies this might not be for you but for me it hit all the right notes an i cant wait for the sequel 
what can i say that reviewers before me have not already said and therein lies some of the problems i have towards some of the complaints i have seen described here sometimes we can over analyze a movie and all of its underpinnings to death whether its in popular media or the world of sports our society loves to build someone or something up and we love to tear it down second guessing is now a cottage industry certain things sometimes just need to be less conditionally enjoyed and i have to say that i enjoyed this movie immensely i would have enjoyed it more had i witnessed it at the theaters but i wasnt able to view it until this past week when it was released to dvd i found it interesting and entertaining on so many levels to me it was like having the dark knight and star trek into darkness all rolled into one viewing i saw an article that read is this the best superman movie ever it is always comical and somewhat frustrating when humans start to contemplate matters in this mode we do it with so much music movies sports just to cite a few examples is the read option going to revolutionize the nfl and are the beatles really just elevator muzak ms r e m sometimes some of us slip into heresy why does there need to be a determination as to whether this superman movie is the best ever beyond of course the ravenous appetite of the media and its proclivity to assuage its hunger through creative journalism i read that the director zack snyder explained something to the effect of finding the version of superman that speaks to this generation and i feel that he succeeded in this wonderfully i was very moved by the subtle gravity to the answer that jonathon kevin costner kent gave a young troubled clark when he asked what was i supposed to do let them die for me this reality also perfectly rationalized the finale i have heard grumblings over supermans attire did we want the bold red blue that were originally patterned after the costumes of circus strongman attire and how then does that reconcile with the need today for everything to be dark real and edgy the explanation for the s symbol was excellent and the worthy performance by michael shannon boardwalk empire as general zod no longer is he a one dimensional psycho power hungry to the point of genocide now there is a much more complex explanation bordering on delusional anti hero i have heard complaints over the high speed quantum destruction that takes place when superman general zod go mano y mano while watching the movie it took a moment for me to get used to this and then it made perfect sense here is a superhero that is so powerful he can reverse time by flying counter clockwise to the earths rotation ugh or simply hold back a crumbing ocean oil rig i did get an eerie feeling watching these unfolding images that had such a surrealistic similarity to the gulf oil spill and the destruction of the world trade centers one of the biggest problems with the superman mythos is how do you have an entity that is so immensely powerful yet still have vulnerabilities i thought this was yet another critical aspect that was handled so well in this film so before i become victim to my own burgeoning micro analysis let me finish by saying that i truly enjoyed this movie one of the better ones i have viewed this past year and congratulations and much appreciation to snyder nolan and all the rest of the mos creative cabal 
this is not your fathers superman nor yours no matter your age i finally understood as best anyone can how a super child became a good man i truly enjoyed this re imagining based on sound backstory that will introduce a new generation to such a noble character i have watched it many times and always walk away with a sense or respect for the story the characters and the people able to convey such a story 
well done graphics and a deeper story line has laid the foundation for a mega franchise i am looking forward to the next installment 
the man of steel movie is both action and plot heavy dealing with complex spiritual issues as well as what it means to be human on the other hand the action is heavy handed with punches bullets and other weaponry being thrown at people on a regular basis this combination of depth and intensity creates a powerful film both visually as well as in theme the performance of the story was breathtaking as expected the visuals were stunning the special effects were phenomenally crisp and the scope of the camera was often wide presenting the scenery itself as a spectacle the acting was exceptional as well shannons zod was angry driven and resourceful everything a good soldier is meant to be his lines were powerful and his intentions and thoughts were practically visible on his face as he acted cavills superman also performed exceptionally each line was delivered with honesty to the character his part was not really dialogue heavy but his role was emotionally demanding requiring sadness fury remorse and empathy at various points in the film his character is vulnerable and emotional unsure of himself which cavill communicated well adams as lois lane was an interesting choice and her role is not given as much screen time for development but she did do a good job playing a driven reporter dedicated to her work even if it means bending the rules it will be interesting to see where her character is taken in the next film which is confirmed as a batman superman movie according to news from comic con the standout performances are definitely the two fathers costner and crowe the fathers without giving anything away are given numerous occasions where emotional scenes are required of them their sequences were powerful and convincing i almost cried in the movie twice and they were involved in them both their performances were moving the story itself was the highlight for me the story fearlessly stepped into religion humanness choice evolution and power stepping out unscathed there will be many who disagree with the films presentation of the ideas even i would disagree in places but by dealing with them they gave the film depth also besides philosophical depth the movies plot was gripping from the beginning and overall solid the film revealed just enough of the plot to keep the audience informed and then continued using flashbacks to catch the audience up as necessary the plot had no real twists but the plot was not necessarily predictable i have not read the comics but the comics could deal with the story so comic book fans could be familiar with the plot i am not sure the story was compelling emotional and relatable this film ranks in my opinion as the best so far this year the acting story and music were all great giving the man of steel a five star return to the big screen acting plot overall 
to me critics are insane in their reviews of this movie more on that later the d was decent but not totally necessary id be happy with d spoiler free review starts now ok im somebody who generally agrees with rotten tomatoes and their critics reviews of movies but this is one time gladly i do not currently this movie since that on rotten tomatoes which is insane to me the man of steel is a great superman movie i love it and to me its times better than superman returns which ironically scored better on rt how i have no idea while its a movie that may have slight pacing problems in regards to the story i went into it just wanting the superman movie that i think many of us have always wanted i want to see superman fighting enemies and saving people like the hero that he is and i think this movie delivers on that front almost i see some people online complaining about the way they show clark growing up in more flashback type scenes and then in the straight story line as a negative and to me i find that sad we really need to see clark as a child learning about himself in a linear fashion most people know that story weve seen it read it or even heard about it before i think the way that was handled made the action start up much faster and made this movie enjoyable now again im somebody i like movies that show you the characters and talk about their pasts and give you reasons to love or hate them in his will he does a pretty decent job in the way it covers general zod jonathan kent and even clark i think lois lane couldve used a little bit more back story but i think this wouldve slowed down the movies progression one other thing i have a gripe about his sometimes the action is so fast paced you cant quite tell what youre looking at and the shaky cam of people running is sometimes ridiculously shaky but again its superman its an action movie i can put up with that because watching him fly around and bash people and save the day is incredible one thing to note there is no after the credits scene like in many other superhero movies that you need to wait for im glad he knew that going in because sitting through this credit roll would take a while and one thing i also liked there are a lot of little nods to the greater dc universe like lex corp signs and even wayne enterprises so if youre real comic fan or dc movie fan theres a lot a little nods that youre going to love to see i think this movie is a great starting point for the justice league movies that are certainly going to follow so all in all if you go into man of steel expecting an exciting comic book movie youre going to get so much more enjoyment out of it i like to think its not as much a character background type movie like the dark knight and not as much comic booky action as the avengers i feel it was the perfect blend its definitely the superman for a new generation and i think it does its job amiably thanks for reading be super man ps michael shannon as general zod was soooo good loved it 
henry cavill is superman and superman is going to catapult henry cavill into mega stardom this latest rendition of superman is nothing short of superb a colossal visual extravaganza of modern day technology artistry and very strong story telling the film begins very syfy i was thinking star wars for several moments while watching the set up but quickly turns into the comic hero action adventure with lots of heart the action sequences were bombastic and goosebump inducing the fans who have been following the many editions and evolution of this superheroe saga will find this film a bit darker more serious than previous versions unlike the final two renditions from the early eighties starring christopher reeve thankfully there are no signs of this superhero ever going the comedic route you may find that this superman is pose to break many expectations specially from skeptics carrying the film with great elegance character and charm and as a perfect fit is henry cavill he conveys enough sensitivities to swoon the viewer yet he has all the powers it takes to crash through many buildings as he fights his nemesis general zod and his bad guys from krypton the clever part of this story is that the bad guys are not the usual bad guys we have come expect because they too have their purpose and noble agenda as well so its not too difficult to empathize with their plight of survival their arrival onto earth is understandable the stellar cast who accompany cavill on this latest journey will leave you wanting an additional two to five hours more of man of steel but fear not clocking in at almost two hours and a half you are sure to leave the theatre with your expectations fulfilled and you may very well treat yourself to repeated viewings if only to revisit the magnificence and scale of this spectacle it is safe to say this latest superman is so far the event film of the film you are not soon to forget its hair raising emotional content in conjunction with some very real and well done action sequences will keep both men and women coming back for more the ending does a great job setting the tone for the upcoming sequels without question this latest version of superman brands cavill into the hall of fame of superheroes and cements man of steel into a new fresh longstanding franchise entertainment film news review
simply put man of steel was freaking awesome i have been waiting for this type of superman movie for longer than i can remember the original superman movie was a good flick for its time and christopher reeves did a masterful job of making us believe superman could hide his identity behind the faade of a bumbling clark kent but im not ashamed to admit i am from a generation that loves spectacular action and special effects and i have been craving a superman movie that really taps into the modern day potential of movie magic with an equally engaging storyline and characters man of steel delivers in spades i dont give this praise lightly i had serious reservations and doubts about this movie going into the theater the bitter taste of superman returns was still fresh in my memory i know the critics have been espousing that the former movie was better than people gave it credit for that it actually got better reviews etc maybe superman returns wasnt a bad movie but it certainly wasnt a good movie either at best it was a blah movie and for a superman movie that just wont cut it superman never even throws a punch in the movie in fact he gets his ass kicked by a couple of thugs while under the influence of kryptonite in fact the biggest super feat in the movie was lifting a big rock incongruously while under the influence of the same kryptonite that allowed the thugs to beat him nearly to death in contrast man of steel has some serious throwdowns with other kryptonians even the super lifting feat included in this movie holding up a collapsing oil rig tower is a heck of a lot cooler than slowly lifting a big rock into space my reservations about man of steel continued in the early days of the production as news trickled out nolan and goyer became involved and though they did a spectacular job with the first two installments of their batman series i was skeptical about their suitability for the superman franchise how would their dedication to ultra realism translate to a story about a man who can bench press mountains and fly through space furthermore in my opinion the last installment of their take on the batman mythos strayed way off course compounding my doubts we soon learned that zod would be the major antagonist of the new movie and while i was encouraged that superman would have a real superhuman opponent i feared we would get another poor copy of the original movies just as superman returns came across as a poorly plagiarized version of the original the earliest trailers for the new movie didnt help either they seemed to suggest a long drawn out discovery process devoid of the superman action sequences i was craving the most exciting thing they showed in the original trailer was superman flying weve been there done that subsequent trailers offered more promise though they still didnt show a lot i guess they were using the old trick of the strip tease show us just enough to get us interested in hindsight im glad they didnt show or reveal more because every moment of the movie was a treat unspoiled by over divulging trailers prior to release i often despair when i have to sit through another origin story for these comic books icons that i know so well im anxious to get to the good stuff but man of steel managed to make the new origins fresh and interesting and extremely relevant to the overall story and holy crap did they nail the casting of the new superman henry cavills superman makes previous movie renditions of the character look like guys playing halloween dress up this guy looks like he could bend steel even without the movie magic the acting was solid all the way around superman came across as caring complicated and heroic lois lane was likable smart and had a real adventurous spirit and loads of integrity you could easily see why superman would fall for this mortal woman contrast that with super bitchy lois from superman returns is it any wonder he decided to leave the planet for five years some critics have argued that this superman is too violent and not true to the character these people obviously dont know much about the character most of supermans stories comic books animated series original superman movies involve violent conflicts with other superhuman opponents do they really think we want another movie where superman battles the elements and catches falling airplanes so to summarize why is man of steel the best superman movie ever awesome action that makes great use of the environment smashing buildings to pieces mega explosions intense superhuman versus superhuman combat can you say using a train as a weapon gives new meaning to more powerful than a locomotive a villain with a goal that makes sense unlike lex luthor from superman returns who thought an ugly chunk of black crystal rock would make for prime real estate a superman that looks the part i am very much a straight man but even i had to think damn when i saw henry cavill as superman and sans shirt in a particular scene a superman who embraces his role as humanitys protector i loved smallville but clarks crying about being different could be tiresome in the early seasons come on you can run faster than the speed of sound and juggle tractors yeah sucks to be you not to mention being able to see into the girls locker room lois lane is no dummy a pair of glasses were never going to fool this girl no more camp man of steel has its humorous moments without resorting to the type of campy antics that were pervasive throughout superman returns in summary man of steel is the superman movie i have been waiting for since i first fell in love with the character i cant wait to see where they take us next 
first off this is not one of the donner reeves superman movies nor is it superman returns that seems to be the beef with many people giving this movie bad reviews this movie stands on its own as those earlier movies did too but to paraphrase someone else if you are a true superman fan youd like em all the movie spends a lot of time delving into the experiences and events shaping clark kents life prior to donning the superman suit but without dwelling too long on them think flashbacks including the fate of krypton at the time of his birth this also explains his actions once he dons the suit at times the movie is fast paced and as this is in effect an origin story character development for some of the supporting cast is therefor sacrificed fodder for sequels some have commented that the spark between superman and lois is missing but given the amount of time they spend together in the movie and under the circumstances they are together romance would be far fetched but their budding relationship is established the movie has also been criticized for excessive violence perhaps but if a ship load of kryptonians arrived with the same powers as superman and they were intent on destroying earth to remake it as a new krypton wouldnt you expect violence to ensue another criticism i feel is unwarranted is the lack of humor again shipload of really bad kryptonians wheres the humor in that the movie has some humor but it is subtle such as when he is learning to fly or when he is handcuffed and then there is the episode with the truck at no point did i find the movie slow or boring to be honest there were a few things i found questionable i had a hard time understanding what some things were on krypton and it wasnt explained how general zod and his crew could speak english especially since they were just alerted to the planets existence i also thought the peoples of earth reaction to the arrival of aliens from outerspace to be too low keyed wouldnt you expect a lot of people to be freaking out the casing was great and credit must be given to henry cavill he looks like superman he could have literally jumped off a page in the comic books im glad they updated the suit spandex and the red underpants would have been dated and they explained its origin however i cant help wonder about the cape why what purpose does it serve if we learn anything in life it should be the immortal words of edna emode from the incredibles no capes with or without a cape looking forward to the sequel 
this movie is awesome i had my doubts about this film and boy it took me for a loop i thought that they did a great job i will always love the original superman movies but i think this reboot is going to be great zack snyder did the original movies justice and did mr christopher revves justice as well i loved the actor who played superman he was really good he got the character down very well we all know that we can not replace christopher reeves as superman but he comes pretty close i thought he was better than brandon roth this movie had so many intense fight scenes espicialy the ones between general zod and superman i was glad they put a different villain besides lex luthor in the movie i thought michael shannon did a great job as general zod and i loved what they did with krypton they made it an actual planet with plants and animals it was very imaginative this series is going to be great if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do i hope it leads into the justice league movie 
this is the best movie of a must see for superman fans a completely different film than the version
this was by far the most comprehensive look at superman that has been done in years from the cells of dead kryptonians fused within him to his childhood and his powers reeking havok because he doesnt know how to control them to humans being afraid of him and the government putting handcuffs on him so that they can interrogate him to that battle with general zod and the destruction that it caused it was all awesome love it totally that last scene with zod took me by suprise never expected that move but i understood why it had to happen this movie was pure movie magic for me and im sure there will be another superman movie in to years i can only hope that it can be just as captivating 
daughter loves superman this was on her christmas list and she especially loves those uv for her apple ipad mini 
there been many versions of superman movies but this one man of steel pin pointed everything about superman in this movie from his birth planet to child hood to adult there was a story behind it that helped make the movie so cool they made teh movie so real like henery cavill was a perfict choice for playing superman nothing weak about this movie i highly recommend buying this movie the best superman move so far 
my sincere thanks to the casting director for finding such a handsome man to play superman i love cristopher reeve as superman but henry cavill is also excellent while reeve has boyish charm and boyish looks it seems that cavill isnt as charming a little more brooding that being said hes great sigh and great to look at a bigger upset for me is that lois lane has become a bit wimpier i much prefer the s lois played by margot kidder she was abrasive and exciting character in her own right this is not the case for adams who is just there very conveniently always there in fact for superman to scoop up i also think that lois lane is better with darker hair but thats another bone to pick zod is a badass as is his crew good job zod an excellent hero film i am anxiously awaiting a sequel 
 man of steel warner dc i went to see this one in the theater with full bore big loud d imax and it was pretty impressive id read a couple of harsh reviews slamming the film as a pile of slag and ive never been that into the previous superman movies but i was ready to give it a chance the trailer i saw months ago looked cool so yeah its pretty good the script is definitely on the serious side tilting towards tragedy and it grinds a little bit as they make absolutely sure we understand how tough clark kents life has been there are precious few light moments in the drama certainly none of the slapstick seen in joss whedons excellent avengers and some of the plot points seemed excessively harsh the fate of pa kent for example but all the grim realism effectively set the tone for the massive battle sequences and thats where the heart of this film lies this is a stunningly violent amazingly kinetic film i had thought whedon nailed super fx in the avengers but man of steel takes superhero movies to a plateau several levels above anything weve seen so far the on screen destruction is massive from the near nuking of smallville to the mega ing of metropolis the digitally produced havoc is truly epic at some point i realized id been immersed in nonstop chaos for about twenty minutes and i was still riveted and awed by what was onscreen very few moments looked awkward or dorky the stiffness of motion that weve come to accept in high tech action films was almost entirely smoothed away and the impression of being there in the moment keeping up with the speed and power of these thunderous metahumans was very convincing the closest thing weve seen elsewhere was the forest battle scene between iron man and thor but this was that scene cubed in terms of translating the imaginative scope of comics in print into film this was amazingly successful they may have trouble living up to this film if a franchise begins but they certainly dont need to re re reboot superman again they nailed it plus henry cavill is a great clark kent hopefully the warner studio can resist the temptation to make the next film into an overwrought epic that brings supermans story to a grand premature conclusion the curse of hollywood superfilm scripts and just have superman have one adventure after another and shed some of the darker psychological overtones if they can sustain this level of impact and excitement ill go to as many of these films as they can make i suspect im not the only person who feels this way in print media superheros have endless adventures why not in film anyway if youve read negative reviews from professional film critics take em with a grain of salt i think this is a genre that a lot of cinema snobs just dont get and the studios are only now starting to get a handle on but man of steel is definitely a big step in the right direction dj joe sixpack readthatagain movie reviews

there have been numerous opinions about positive and negative points dealing with this film no movie will ever be perfect and please everyone but i have to applaud zack schneider for giving us a new vision of superman never seen on screen before when superman returns came out in most fanboys were screaming about having no action in the film superman didnt even throw a punch was a common critique well wb heard their complaints and made a degree turnaround as far as im concerned they went from one extreme to the other ive described this film to others as a rollercoaster ride that rarely stops its shocking how much is thrown at you during the course of this story you will not see a clark kent with perfect parents who bake apple pies and have the perfect answers for any questions clark has you will not see a completely happy childhood where little clark has no real cares and worries until his father dies you will not find a superman who has all of the answers of exactly what he needs to do to solve a problem this is a movie where clark is uncertain who he is and doesnt necessarily want to have his powers and abilities that set him apart from everyone else causing him to be a target by others he learns how to control his anger with people he would be able to turn into a pretzel if he wanted to he does not know how to deal with another kryptonian named zod who wishes to rule planet earth he just knows he needs to stop him from this alien invasion there are a few scenes that i believe were inspired partially from the avengers when superman is handcuffed and marched into custody it is almost exactly the kind of shot used when loki was marched to his cell in the avengers near the end of the film there is an invasion that also takes me back to be avengers inspired is that bad i would say no zack schneider had a tremendous undertaking to take a hero who was losing interest to batman and give him a huge comeback while also setting up a dc universe of films at the same time there were big changes made to supermans origin story there are changes in how his father dies his fortress of solitude is very different than what you imagine in any other superman film before it but none of these things take away from the identity of the character of superman only people like me who grew up with the reeve version may try to compare films like this of course there is an extremely controversial ending if you dont know what i mean this is a spoiler alert superman makes the ultimate life or death decision to either allow zod to continue his mission of death to all humans or stop him in one pivotal scene he makes the quick decision to break zods neck rather than allow him to do any more killing and destruction some people were screaming how superman doesnt kill they need to realize that superman has killed before for goodness sakes he fought and killed doomsday in the comics in superman ii he allows the three kryptonian villains to fall to their death in schneiders world superman doesnt have the hard and fast rule that you never take a life he made this decision based on the basis of a killer who cannot be killed and now he will live with it for the rest of his life for this superman it probably is the origin of the no kill rule its going to be interesting to find out how they deal with this in the next installment i loved the casting russell crow is a wonderful jor el there are also ties to other superman shows diane lane was in hollywoodland where she played the girlfriend of george reeves the actor who portrayed superman in the s by the way i also was very excited to find out ben affleck will be batman in the sequel because he played george reeves in the previously mentioned movie and donned a superman costume lois lane amy adams was in the first season of smallville for me it was just fun to watch these characters who had a superman connection previously was it a perfect film no name one film that is but it does do justice to the worlds first superhero and tried to find a balance between the darkness of batman and the opposite brightness of superman this movie is not a bright one like the previous films it is shot in a grittier fashion for those seeking a superman film with bright scenes and beautiful colors you wont find it here go back to the reeve films but superman is finally given a story that many fans have been waiting a very long time to see i think its a very well done film and i hope you do too superman flies high and seems to relate to what happens in todays world i enjoyed it and am looking forward to the sequel in 
ignore ignore ignore the first review and others that have labeled this movie negatively sheesh what did they do rush on here and post negative comments the minute it was available for purchase who are these people and whats their motivation they must have watched a completely different movie than i did seriously thats the only answer superman is a fantastic movie one that brings him fully into the st century i watched this in the theater and just finished viewing it at home this evening and im even more impressed with the story line direction and actors truly an awesome film if youre a fan of superman i can guarantee with certainty that you will not be disappointed p s i cant wait for the sequel 
this is one of the best superman films made and i have quite a large collection of all the works that have had supes on film and tv 
this is possibly the best superman film ever produced the acting is well done the writing and portent exceptional especially for a science fiction film the characters in this version are provocative and intriguing this film fills in many missing elements in the superman phenomenon such as parantage origination heritage culture and mythic biology this is the most entertaining version of superman i have yet viewed 
love this film i cant help but feel bad for those who are stuck on the old drama filled superman that christopher reeve played the version i got is the target exclusive which features about minutes of exclusive stuff its blu rays and dvd the nd blu ray features a new type of video commentary that pushes the film to being over hours long
henry cavill is on great superman he really gives the character so much more that any of the preceding actors in this role i think he is the best one yet 
im not a comic book aficionado i grew up with cartoons in the s and s and leaned more to dc comics than marvel but even i had to say that up to the batman re boot with the nolan trilogy marvel films were better action and better stories but man of steel comes up to bat and while it might not be a grand slam it is certainly a home run zach snyder and christopher nolan have added a new layer of complexity to the superman storyline while still allowing for character development action and a storyline that stays true to the original mythology henry cavill superman clark kent amy adams lois lane she had an appearance as a villain in smallville michael shannon zod and diane lane martha kent all give great appearances in their roles big or small russell crowe is a fantastic and very believable jor el lets hope they can re utilize him in future dc comics supeman justice league sequels mos is a unique film compared to previous superman storylines from the adventures of superman through the cartoons of the s and s to the superman film with christopher reeve to the recent smallville tv series every showing of superman has shown superman advancing in chronological order usually from birth his appearance on earth but mos took a different tack which makes the film very interesting where series of flashbacks like dream sequences from clarks time on earth are interspersed with the main storyline so you see a very young clark in school an adolescent clark saving a school bus an early s clark working at a bar clark on a fishing vessel and the death of jonathan kent great performance by kevin costner at different times in the film seemingly popping up at random it accentuates the importance of these events in the younger clarks life and tells the story of his time on earth in a different perspective the ordering of the appearances fills in the blanks and makes the story arc of the last son of krypton riveting and appealing to those who already know the superman mythology which is probably most of us very well done as for the movie itself jor el and zods relationship is dramatic and a new twist on zods megalomania it is too bad they couldnt explore this in further detail or go back in time when they were strong allies perhaps in a sequel i have always thought that a story arc focusing solely on what happened with jor el zod and the rest of krypton before the planetary cataclysm would have made for a great storyline the darker tone of mos would have lent itself more to such a story more so than the kryptonian council scenes at the beginning of the superman movie pay attention to the difference in clarks tone and attitude toward his parents when he is complaining to jonathan kent about following in his footsteps as a farmer and later in the movie when he goes after zod for threatening his mother lois lanes relationship to superman is introduced in a different fashion than in previous incarnations of superman another positive the writers and producers stayed true to the basic superman story arc but knew they needed a few changeups to make this different to captivate the audience besides the darker tone perry whites character is much less interesting and funny than jackie coopers portrayal in the film but if lawrence fishburne is ok with it who am i to complain the ending has plenty of action and the complaints by some that there is too much rock em sock em action is a bit off base this isnt the batman trilogy where you are dealing with a brilliant martial arts detective you are talking about super powered beings whose dense molecular structures are magnified probably trillion fold by the power of earths sun the complaint about superman returns was that the trailers had most of the action and the movie had very little follow up that isnt the case in mos even little things are accentuated as this film pays attention to detail check out clarks eyes when he helps heals lois injury nice touch plenty of extras are to be included in the blu ray version of the movie behind the scenes deleted scenes etc the move lasts minutes which is rather long but it flows very evenly the movie is laid out in such a way with different story blocs that it flows better than if they had followed the chronology of the movie from clarks rocketship appearance on earth to the present man of steel is a great film in its own right and a worthy successor to the movie which was one of the biggest box office hits of the s some have commented that the ticket sales for mos were disappointing but it is possible that the smallville tv series ended and superman returns both dampened any pent up demand for a successful and new version of the story batman begins was years after the final george clooney semi camp batman movie but the nolan trilogy didnt kick into high gear until the dark knight hit in mos did better than batman begins by almost when the dark knight followed up batman begins years later it more than doubled the earlier film one wonders if there was a superman only follow up instead of the rumored batman superman justice league hookup if it could springboard on the first films success and reach the levels of the nd and rd films in the nolan trilogy looks like well never know so lets hope ben afleck and the scriptwriters dont screw up the successor to man of steel 
seventy five years ago this month jerry siegel and joe schuster brought the man of steel into the world through dc comics today appropriately on flag day the first the best imagined superhero of all time has been reintroduced to the world by director zack snyder writer david goyer producer christopher nolan and personified in the perfect embodiment of henry cavill for those wary of long reviews heres the condensed version wow upon watching captain america the first avenger two years ago i declared it to be the best superhero movie ever made that sentiment remained a year later after watching the avengers no question it was fun magnificently made sheer escapist fantasy but it wasnt more than that it lacked its predecessors heart well man of steel combines the nonstop action and state of the art special effects of the avengers with the soul and spirit of the first avenger which captain america borrowed from superman heres how it doesnt pull any punches almost every aspect of this film is academy award worthy while i agree that christopher nolan is a very competent and interesting film maker ive always found his work muddled where the special effects take over the storytelling resulting in minimal depth and often confusing the story told his talents were better served here in a hands off approach i commend him for his decision to turn over creative control to zack snyder who clearly owns this film together with cavill these two men carried the initial premise of a one of a kind child born to an extraordinary couple from a race of extraordinary beings to its logical conclusion without ever flinching theres one particular scene toward the end that made me cry like a baby for a good five minutes its a powerful scene in a film full of powerful scenes i read a preliminary review a few days ago criticizing this film for lacking humanity now that ive seen it for myself i couldnt disagree more in that one scene not only did i feel supermans humanity but i think i understand now what it must be like for an american soldier when he she takes up arms to defend all they love from those who promise to destroy it the extraordinary price they pay for their patriotism and commitment is heartbreaking this film answers the question of which is the real man and which is the disguise the truth is that there is no disguise kal el clark kent superman theyre all facets of the same man all real in the context of different aspects of his life and experience and for those who roll their eyes at the idea of a simple pair of glasses serving as a disguise you try it some time youd be surprised at how many people are willing to dismiss someone from extraordinary contention if they consistently keep themselves to behind the scenes work dont behave in a flamboyant or even assertive manner they dont announce everything they do and say and dont make themselves the story on social media or anywhere else yes there are still people who value their privacy thankfully as long as they dont show off anything that might be coveted by others most people are very much willing to let them continue in anonymity henry cavills performance is perfect i dont use this word lightly before today george reeves from the s adventures of superman was my favorite clark kent and christopher reeve from the late s s movies was my favorite superman cavill not only matches them in caliber but surpasses them in presence and personification he is strong in every way the love he oozes throughout the film makes him that much more powerful with snyders guidance similarly like gerard butler in he walks the fine line of being vulnerable without ever seeming corny or weak besides having kirk alyns earnestness george reeves intelligence christopher reeves strength dean cains charm brandon rouths charisma and tom wellings looks henry cavill brings passion to the role something that was sorely lacking all these years welling did exude passion in smallville season but in season he was only able to sustain passion in his scenes with durance cavill seems to get along with his leading lady however as i predicted after watching the final two minutes of smallville two years ago no couple will ever surpass the perfect combustible chemistry of erica durance and tom welling in their combined portrayal of lois and clark durance stated that shell never again play lois lane without welling in the lead and i suspect welling has privately made the same decision their commitment to each other is admirable but it is a shame well never see cavills clark with durances lois durance together with phyllis coates remain my favorite lois lane i wasnt much of a fan of any of the supporting players before this i particularly didnt care for russell crowe or kevin costner but by their second and third scenes respectively i actually forgot their previous work and accepted them as supermans two fathers laurence fishburne was really good as perry white i didnt mind the actress who played ma kent as much as i thought i might and all the krypton and armed forces actors were excellent hans zimmer music was inspired it fit cavills portrayal surprisingly i didnt miss john williams signature piece and by the way there are countless easter eggs paying homage to previous superman renditions for example one of the times superman saves lois they land in a kansas corn field exactly where lois first meets kal el in smallville only she was saving him in that version also the way jor el and lara launch their baby to earth is very similar to superman the animated series and the superman theatrical serial july update saw this film again yesterday but in imax it was really loud but most everything else was as i remembered except this time i found myself annoyed by the actress who played supermans girl friday shes almost as bad as the one in superman returns but at least that one sort of looked the part after they put that long dark curly wig on her perhaps i didnt really pick up on it the first time because i was so focused on the main character but she was seriously miscast clarks partner needs to be his mortal female mirror image tall dark and beautiful with a temperament and physicality to match her traditional upbringing by a four star general to make her action scenes believable here she just looked like a short red head little kid with wrinkles playing in her moms high heels and holding a toy ray gun shes a full nine years older than cavill and looks it too i dont blame zack snyder for this it seems nolan cast her before snyder was given the helm its too bad because snyder knows so much more about picking leading ladies than nolan does just compare the female leads in and watchmen to those in the the dark knight trilogy youd think nolan was allergic to beautiful women regardless i found myself inspired by henry cavill even more this second time around for those involved this film might very well end up being their magnum opus their masterpiece and for this films audience at least for my part im grateful for their excellence for zack snyder and henry cavill in particular congratulations and for the man of steel himself happy birthday three quarters of a century and counting he still stands for truth justice and the american way thank god for it 
ive been at a loss to understand people before but never more so than after watching this film why rt only gives it a is a question i cannot even begin to answer man of steel is the first superman movie thats worthy of the character it portrays everything about it including the story line the scenes the action the character development and everything else is truly epic in scale forget gene hackman in a toupee trying to drive up real estate prices this time the enemy is an invader from the stars who wants to wipe out humanity and he can do it this time clark is so overwhelmed by the power within him that he spends years trying to figure out what to do with it this time we have a noble yet tormented soul who struggles with the voices calling him in a thousand different directions all at once in short this time we have an epic which is exactly what the life story of an ultra powerful messianic figure should be no corniness no silliness no flying around the earth to make time go backwards oh and no supposedly intelligent people fooled about his identity by a pair of glasses i always hated that in the comic books and superman is no naive boy scout he has what musicians call mileage that makes him all the more believable sympathetic and human simply put this movie is outstanding on all levels and i will never understand why anyone would disagree with that analysis 
this is by far the best superman movie to date with the exception of the very first one with the late mr reeves 
it is exactly how i always imagined superman to be from his history to his decisions to his outfit i grew up with tv reruns and christopher reeves movies of superman they all were entertaining but to me it just wasnt how i imagined superman was to be portrayed on screen it deals a lot more with his alien lineage which to me is very important after all superman is an alien and not a man at all so it helps to understand the choices he makes more understandable and deeper born an alien raised a human 
man of steel was great the only thing that surprised me was how much crap they tore up of course i know it was all digital but still superman in the comics and cartoon series did not tear up half as much as christopher nolans interpretation i enjoyed it i suppose it was more realistic than the comics but i still did not like the way it ended you killed zod superman wtf could have at least sent him to the phantom zone like you usually do i still loved it though 
this movie is perfectly cast with a list actors and is much more textured and nuanced than the first superman movie dont get me wrong i actually loved the first movie and thought it was well done but this new movie successfully has carved out its own niche the first go at superman had a lot of humor in it but this film takes a much more dramatic approach the special effects were dazzling with the final battle scene between zods forces and superman seems so realistic i highly recommend you watching this movie and if you buy films worthy of adding to your film collection then hurry to your store and buy it 
i am a person who has been a superman fan since the days of george reeves and have followed the caped crusader from childhood into my adulthood i have to say i was a little skeptical of this new superman replacing our last actor brandon routh whom i thought fit the image of superman very well the origins of superman was also altered a bit so i had to watch this version with an open mind while i was disappointed that his beginnings were changed once i was able to get into this version i really enjoyed the movie the characters were well done and the on screen graphics were very impressive 
i like superman but was never a huge fan of the movies this was is by far the best movie 
wow what a film the finest film of the summer so far i enjoyed man of steel so much i really did not know where to start with my review i had to rewrite the first paragraph a couple of times should i begin with the astonishing action and effects or the characters that come alive on the screen maybe i should talk first about zack snyder and with his direction of man of steel he solidifies as one of the best modern day directors along with the likes of christopher nolan and david o russell i thought about first talking about the characters and how they came alive on screen giving emotional depth and impact to the film but i have decided to first talk about my knowledge and opinion of superman in that way you can understand how surprising it is for me to love man of steel in all honesty my attitude toward superman and the superman comics is one of indifference clark kent or superman was just never a compelling character to me i mean come on he is essentially a god and was so invincible that the writers of the comics had to find some kind of weakness for superman and came up with the lame excuse of kryptonite it just seemed ridiculous to me my only contact with superman in the comics was with the whole death of superman saga when the death of superman storyline came out in it captivated me the comics were brilliantly written and the story was emotionally compelling but then dc writers decided to make clones or whatever of superman and what was even more of a middle finger to the fans was that the fans brought superman back to life and so quickly it just came of as an insult to fans and i do not understand how fans of the comics and the character could forgive that slight so easily needlessly to say that turned me off to the comics i still watched the cartoons along with the old christopher reeve films and the regrettable superman returns my favorite adaptation of superman was in the lois clark television show staring dean kane as clark kent superman and teri hatcher as lois lane it was well crafted and kane and hatcher had chemistry on screen but still i was never that impressed with the character and my opinion over the years has turned to indifference until the man of steel dc comics along with the heavily underrated zach snyder and christopher nolan have created a near masterpiece in man of steel that pulled me into supermans universe making me emotionally invested in superman and the rest of the characters creating the best film of the summer so far and one of the best films of the year i cannot speak on accurate the storyline is compared to the comics so i will not discuss or try and compare the two the script was written by david s goyer and christopher nolan and together they do a superb job of creating a realistic world for superman and what would it be like if superman really appeared on earth along with our reactions toward him and the reality if someone like superman got involve in a battle in a major city like new york the two writers along with snyder bring to life krypton like i have never seen before i do not know if what happens in the film actually happened in the comics and honestly i do not care if it did because i loved the world goyer and nolan wrote and that snyder brought to life on earth clark struggles to find his place in the world where he grew up yet is an alien to it clark becomes a wanderer traveling from place to place helping people along the way and in doing so he finds a friend and confidant in lois lane clark is forced to make a decision about the direction of his life when general zod appears demanding that earth hand over superman to him does clark keep his identity hidden because he does not know if he can trust the humans or not or does he turn himself over to zod even though he knows without a doubt that general zod cannot be trusted the depth of the writing is as i said outstanding giving everything you could want from a terrific film who do dc and snyder cast to play superman it is an important question because without the right actor for the role a superman film will fail and i believe you need an actor with both the acting ability along with the physical presence to play the iconic character reeves did an admirable job in the role through four films while kane lacked the acting ability to pull off the emotional depth i think the character should have and brandon routh was just a plain terrible choice to play superman henry cavill i believe was the perfect choice as he has both the physical presence and acting ability to pull off playing a god on earth and cavil performance splendidly showing viewers how conflicted clark is about whom he is where he comes from and who he supposed to become amy adams is gives a great performance as lois lane the investigative journalist for the daily planet along with having great chemistry with cavill she shows that lois is more than just a pretty face and a damsel in distress russell crowe gives a memorable performance as jor el clarks biological father giving an emotional performance especially in the beginning of the film on krypton michael shannon has already given a great performance earlier this year in mud that i believe he should be nominated for his role as a supporting actor shannons performance in mud was more subdued than in the man of steel but playing general zod you should expect that i have read criticism of his performance in his performance as zod but i thought he did a wonderful job playing the flawed character zod is a man whose job it to protect and ensure the survival of the people of krypton at all costs even if it means damning his own soul in the process zod i do not believe is a truly evil character he is doing what he believes he has to do to ensure the survival of his race and shannon does a good job displaying that especially one scene in the film when all hope is lost for him and his people the rest of the supporting cast does a good job diane lane does a good job as martha kent as does laurence fishburne who gives a good performance in his limited role as perry white and christopher meloni is does a decent job as colonel nathan hardy the only casting choice i had a problem with was kevin costner as jonathan kent or maybe it had to do more with the how the character was written than costners performance it just seemed like goyer and nolan did not know exactly what to do with the character and his relationship with clark for all the criticism zach snyder gets he is without question on of the best visual directors around and has proven so with and watchmen snyder finds a way to bring his films to life for his audience pulling them into his films like no other director can and he does it again with the help of warner brothers dc and a large budget the effects are breathtaking from the war on krypton to superman battling two other krytonians in smallville are mesmerizing and i do not believe any other director could bring to life superman like snyder had his visual expertise along with the cgi bring to life the action making to real and that what you are seeing is actually happing and is that not the point of great cgi in that you cannot tell the difference in what is real and what is fake or that the cgi and action is so good that the viewer does not care and that is what you get with man of steel that superman action film fans have always wanted as well as showing the devastating impact of gods fighting on earth i really do not understand why people bash zach snyder the man is a really good film director with an outstanding visual eye i am not a big fan of but the film was visually wonderful with watchmen snyder beautifully brought to life one of the best comic graphic novels ever and created one of the best comic films to date here in man of steel he continues his journey in becoming one of the better directors in hollywood with the help of nolan and goyer snyder creates a beautiful film and a memorable world of superman that no director has done before the only problem with the production of the film is with the score that was done by hans zimmer which is surprising because i usually love his film scores but with man of steel the music was a little too bombastic in tone which i thought took away from the film what are the critics thinking i do not know because i loved man of steel maybe it is because i am not a fan of the superman comics or the character who knows but i thought the man of steel was an excellent film with great direction a well crafted screenplay well written characters that were wonderfully performed along with simply amazing visuals and effects that make man of steel the best film of the summer one of the best films of the year and a must for comic and non comic fans alike i think dc has finally realized what they do to continue their longevity of the comic properties and though i am definitely not a dc fan i am surprisingly looking forward to a sequel and what dc does next with its properties i highly recommend man of steel and i do not think anyone should be disappointed with the film 
the cast in this movie is solid as a rock henry cavill did an excellent job of letting us all grow up with him and convey what it would be like to be tasked by both russell crowe real father kevin costner on earth your fathers that you are the one thats going to restore an entire planet and give the people hope again the story was new different and updated just like it needed to be if you havent seen this movie you really should go i love movies that leave me feeling better when its over than when i started maybe i needed a little hope and this movie delivered of what i needed 
i realize that this version of the superman saga is a total reboot the christopher reeve stories do not exist it is an origin story told in great detail but it cant just be me the similarities between reeve henry cavill are pretty obvious but there cant be too much wiggle room there both are good looking physical specimens ive lived in kansas for the last years yeah hes all american the epic begins of course with the eminent destruction of krypton jor el is having difficulties with gen zod sends son kal el clark to earth thats the short version we all know jor el dies but reappears to move the story along clark hooks up with lois of course has an epic battle with zod with vast destruction i guess i havent told anything yet this all happens before clark ever gets a job at the daily planet lots more of course but im out of time russell crowe kevin costner add a bit of class to the proceedings with excellent portrayals of supermans fathers 
this to me is probably the best superman movie made to date it captures the essence of the original comic books and expands on it to a great degree of enjoyment if you are a superman fan definitely watch this movie 
the man of steel is a great movie retelling the first superhero in the comic world and i believe doing him great justice the film of course is about clark becoming superman but he isnt superman just yet one of the reasons hes not called superman in the film or any where on the title of the movie is because hes not superman just yet so for respect of the movie ill just call him super clark well super clark makes a lot of mistakes things he won t make in the future when he finally becomes the superman however this movie made it clear that this was the beginning of his journey one of the best flashbacks i have seen in a movie allowed the film to progress very quickly and get to the real meat of the film which was his kryptionian brothers trying to obtain him as super clark is a bit more essential and special when compared to his people dont wont to spoil it anyways once the kryptionians come to get him epic fight scenes occur and for the first time in live action we get to see what a true superhero can do when i went to the theaters and saw this movie i was purely wowed and if you give this movie a shot you will too but please be mindful this version of super clark is gritty a bit more like the comics now a days but still a good moral movie for the family i give this movie a enjoy 
i got the man of steel collectors edition combo pack number out of obviously i didnt buy it here got it directly from warner brothers online shop anyways it comes with what you see in the pictures its great to have on display comes with a stand ultraviolet makes it convenient to watch the movie online rather than using the physical discs still the discs are convenient for when you dont have internet then theres the special features disc where you can see the making of the film and how much work they have put into making this movie such as the cgi that they use to create krypton entirely or how they put together the superman versus zod fight or how the actors were so great at what they do in certain scenes such as the part of where that one trucker was being a bully to clark kent or how young clark was sensing everything and ran to the janitors closet i am very satisfied with this as for the movie itself i will do sections of what i think of it the story lots of action it never gets boring unlike superman returns where it was slow and dull man of steel gets right into action where you see jor el fight off zods forces sometime after supermans birth thats how fast the action starts theres some flash backs to supermans childhood i was able to relate to him because of those flash backs due to him getting bullied and feeling like an outcast i went through the same thing in my childhood the action is exactly like the comics because there is a lot of destruction of metropolis just go read action comics for proof of that anyways the fight scene between superman and zod was excellent it was like a live action dragonball z fight the part were superman snaps zods neck got a lot of criticism but did they not read any of the comics did they missed out on what superman did to zod in superman superman kills zod there is no other way to stop him hell he even kills nuclear man in superman anyways over all the story was great and epic the music hans zimmer does a fantastic job of scoring this film its one of the main reasons i love this film it was a very epic and poetic score what else is there to be said its the same guy that scored the dark knight trilogy content when you get the man of steel collectors edition it comes with four discs and a code for the digital copy the special features gives you many details about what happens behind the scenes when creating this movie it also gives you a closer look at planet krypton and how much work they put into every last detail including the language i have yet to see the d version of the film but since i dont have a d hdtv it will have to wait i have not used the blu ray version of the film since i got my digital copy that i can view instead i did however use the dvd version when i went to my brothers house since they dont have internet however one of them took the ps controller with him making it impossible to see this movie on blu ray without it so i had to use the dvd version on the xbox which solves everything as we eat pizza and enjoyed the movie the casing that houses the discs folds out the steel case looks nice when its on the stand when being displayed the magnets on the stand keeps that s shield in place overall there is less than of these available so buy it when you have a chance because once its gone the value of this will go up just like the teenage mutant ninja turtles collectors edition party wagon of the cartoon series should have paid for it when i had the chance now it sells for on ebay ridiculously it is highly recommended for hardcore superman fans out there so grab it while you can 
it only took decades numerous embarrassing miscues and one real gem of a film christopher reeves first superman film to figure out how to turn the iconic superman character into a real movie star previous films dealt with more silver age type adventures as the character of superman became more and more like clark kent instead of the reverse now we are presented with yet another version as another new ish actor and a new hot director try to solve the long standing riddle of making a great superman movie in this case it appears they have man of steel finally just shucks aside the humanity and admits that despite any protestations to the opposite kal el is a god and he needs to fight other gods like zod and when gods do battle among mere mortals humanity is swept aside in a terrible wave of carnage and it is finally exciting because we are shown this is a film where there are terrible consequences to punching someone with the power of a thousand tons of tnt and driving them through multiple buildings buildings collapse and the people inside die often falling like confetti to the streets below it is at once both terrible and wonderful to behold finally the feeling of the danger and the speed inherit in the concept of a super powered slugfest is fully expressed with astounding visual and audio effects the picture is top notch the channel sound is fully immersive and this is a movie you need in your blu ray player now cant wait for the sequel 
growing up i was the marvel comic fan and my brother was into dc we always challenged each others favorite superhero against each others eventually we just agreed to disagree to my appeal in the past decade or so there were many more marvel movie adaptations created than dc sure i loved the dark knight trilogy but the avengers and all the separate related movies for each superhero kept my blu ray player busy until man of steel came out initially i knew this picture would be something special and quite unique under zack snyders direction i have enjoyed his visionary work for years along with christopher nolan man of steel was a relished break from my marveldom having watched all previous superman movies and re runs of the george reeve tv series i couldnt resist how happy i was as i try to avoid the usual trash talk on the internet my son was telling me these terrible things that people were saying about man of steel to put his and my own reservations to rest we saw this fabulous movie on opening day d i max got my ticket worth while he saw it from a year olds eyes i saw so much more unlike val kilmers batman or george clooney as the more goofy version i will venture to say that every cast member in man of steel was fully fleshed out dimensional characters who made you feel what they felt from the beginning scenes on krypton we were on krypton like never before how the kryptonians lived for as long as they lived it a fully immersive environment that was more biological than ecological hence their impending destruction before now we only had glimpses or notions of krypton in prior movies comics or cartoons each member of krypton society has or had a specific function and lived to that end of those we do meet no matter how diabolical one gets their full depth of meaning to said function there are no cardboard actors here general zod michael shannon truly believes that killing jor el russell crowe was out of fury we can feel this out of the passion of pain as he watched the only future he had rocket away the were friends and this death on zods hands scars him to the end on earth kevin costner jonathan kent takes in baby kal el clark kent along with martha diane lane as adopted parents i believe they do the best any parent would unconditional love teach wrong from right and seek spiritual guidance as seen several times the human condition prevails as clark grows from a young boy he naturally questions these powers he finds he has yet jonathan continues to allow clark to make the choice at one point clark even asks jonathan why did god do this to me purely in a hypothetical way as he knows there is no answer this is the spirituality essence of this film at another critical juncture and more likely the most important clark walks into a church to further seek spiritual guidance as to how and what to do when he knows the fate of all life on earth depends on his coming out as kal el ultimately a man of the cloth gives him the support needed while superman may be seen as god like he too needs a higher power to look to for the unknown i thought this was not only relevant but highly un noticed by all the nay sayers these vignettes that occur throughout clarks life is inevitably what makes him the man he becomes well before he is the man of steel in his life in life itself we must learn morals values and principals this goes for anybody to know the difference from right and wrong and why jonathan continually tells clark that the world isnt ready to find out about him he makes the ultimate sacrifice to keep the secret as that tornado is about to suck him away he waves clark off had clark ran or flew to save jonathan those under the underpass would surely have found out spread the word about the guy who can fly but the time wasnt right because clark wasnt ready in turn now fully kal el superman makes his own ultimate sacrifice just before zod was able to depress the fire button and blow up the plane ahead as it was preparing to destroy the dark zero kal crashes through zods ship kals eyes are lit wit his heat vision and ready to take out zod zod yells out and stops him wait if you destroy this ship you destroy krypton kal thinks for a second and retorts krypton had its chance then relights his eyes and proceeds to take out zods ship that was clarks kal els supermans ultimate sacrifice was man of steel too violent as some many have claimed actually no when the fighting scenes happen the special effects are some of the best i have seen in many years but they are not rampant throughout the movie the destruction of krypton was no more graphic than vulcans destruction in star trek the fight scenes are limited to either smallville or metropolis i mean there are aliens fighting that are god like status this is superman who doesnt know the superman mythos the city of metropolis being crushed well lets see godzilla has done worse clover in cloverfield or the avengers battling the tretarri took out a bigger chunk of manhattan there are many others look this is a superman for this generation i had no problem having my year old son watch this with me and blu ray too now man of steel is by no means over the top i fear more from what both of my kids can view on the internet and as far as what the internet talking heads say well i have a few choice words i shant post here for them i absolutely suggest highly recommend getting man of steel on blu ray dvd doesnt do this justice the special effects are outstanding if you do get this package this comes with a bonus rd disc full of extras i was floored when i saw just how much was special effects you will not be disappointed final thought here to those who wrote the or star reviews i think that there are just some people out here who will not be happy with anything maybe they secretly watched man of steel and loved it but were bummed out because their date stood them up popcorn was cold 
man of steel portrays a young superman who is forced to confront his secret extraterrestrial heritage when earth is invaded by members of his race after seeing the previous attempt at remaking superman which failed miserably i was hopeful at the new reboot that brought more of a dark knight style of movie to the man of steel i was not disappointed this new remake blew me away with its visual effects including the d a great story great action and an awesome villain henry cavill played a great superman who is trying to find his way russell crowe and kevin costner both played their roles as supermans fathers very well with crowe playing a huge role throughout the movie costner brought an almost field of dreams like quality to his role michael shannon played one of the best villians i have seen onscreen in a while his scowl throughout the movie made me believe he would do what it takes at completing his mission no matter who or what stood in his way although some of the original elements of the superman story were changed no surprise as most movies seem to do that i wasnt bothered by most except the dramatic ending which i wont give away here but seemed to be out of character for superman they finally did the superman story right for the most part and i look forward to this on blu ray and look forward to the sequels 
this is the best superman movie since the original w christopher reese so many years ago with stunning special effects and a well acted and filmed storyline this is a must see for any fans of action movies like pacific rim transformers avengers which i also like and the best part is the big budget special effects dont take away from the thoughtful acting and well written storyline absolutely captivating i really enjoyed this movie a lot at first i wasnt sure whether or not to get it am glad i did top shelf stars and an engaging fast paced story make this remake of the origin story well worth watching ill watch it many times in the years to come bravo well done thrilling and thoughtful state of the art effects and more a real treat for us superhero action movie fans its entertaining and fun to watch ken
i couldnt have been more pleased with this superman movie ive read some reviews that said there was not enough character development and that the final third of the film had too much action i dont agree with either of those opinions i thought the setup with clark searching for his origins was really well done i thought the use of flashbacks moved things along faster and was very interesting and i loved the way lois tracked him down and the way their first meeting went as far as the action and special effects went wow i will say that i can understand how some people would feel that the length and intensity of the action at the end might be exhausting but in my case i have been wanting to see superman in that kind of building collapsing slugfest since i first heard of the character it was great and the part where you see zod gaining the power of flight and taking off his kryptonian armor was truly scary i found myself thinking jeez if superman doesnt take him down right now he may not be able to later and the world will be lost it was really a thrilling comic book feel like a kid moment just a great movie im putting aside coins from my paper route now so i can buy multiple copies of the blu rays asap 
 man of steel is excellent this is how the story goes a young boy learns that he has extraordinary powers and is not of this earth as a young man he journeys to discover where he came from and what he was sent here to do but the hero in him must emerge if he is to save the world from annihilation and become the symbol of hope for all mankind the cast led by henry cavill as clark kent kal el superman amy adams as lois lane michael shannon as general zod kevin costner as jonathan kent diane lane as martha kent laurence fishburne as perry white russell crowe as jor el is excellent the directing by zack snyder is excellent the story based on the comic books created by jerry siegel joe shuster by david s goyer also did the screenplay christopher nolan who also produced the screenplay by goyer is excellent the music by hans zimmer is excellent the cinematography by amir mokri is excellent the film editing by david brenner is excellent the casting by kristy carlson lora kennedy is excellent the production design by alex mcdowell is excellent the art direction by chris farmer kim sinclair is excellent the set decoration by anne kuljian set dressings by paul allen danial a miller jr guy roland david soukup patrick kearns set designs by stevo bedford mike barton aric cheng david clarke scott herbertson david w krummel tammy s lee thomas machan david moreau sarah nolan margot ready kerry sanders bryan sutton is excellent the costume design by james acheson michael wilkinson is excellent the special effects supervised by allen hall scott kodrik coordinated by joel whist john d milinac is excellent the visual effects supervised by david wallace allen john d j des jardin joe letteri keith miller guillaume rocheron chad wiebe ged wright coordinated by valdone cerniute ana marie cruz isabelle fleck jack george sofus graae james greig rachel faith hanson danny huerta ashley irving scott zafar janjua woojo jeon abigail mendoza sarah middleton sara moore marlene nehls max rees rebecca scott is excellent the stunts coordinated by damon caro fights coordinated by ryan watson is excellent this is an excellent and well done well made reboot of the superman saga that is entertaining and impressive this is also an impressive film visually and thematically zack snyder has directed an excellent film which is possibly his best film of his career thus far christopher nolan has also done an excellent job in helping revive the superman saga henry cavill is an excellent superman clark kent kal el amy adams is an excellent lois lane with an excellent cast backing them up this is one of the best movies of the summer season and of the year 
as far as im concerned the only really good superman movie ever made this show explains who he is where he came from and why hes the way he is its realistic in how a boy of his abilities might cope with childhood and explains how the final product came to be its much more realistic and believable than all the previous superman flicks i hope its the start of a true superman legend 
its obvious that people who didnt like this movie dont grasp that its a coming of age story for superman hes not the superman we know in this movie because he hasnt gotten to that point yet hes still trying to figure everything out i mean the first time he puts on his suit is so he can turn himself over to zod all of this is brand new to him including fighting a group of beings that are just as powerful as him yet more skilled as warriors so you can imagine that destruction is just going to happen around them the only thing i didnt love about this movie is the climactic fight between kal el and zod was hard to follow because of the frenetic camera work other than that i love this movie and cant wait to own it on blu ray 
after hearing numerous bad reviews of this film from rotten tomatoes to channels on my sirius radio i was flabbergasted the trailers looked so cool but i knew that ive seen many a movie where the trailer looked so good but the film wasnt was it possible that man of steel was going to be the same i loved zak snyders and his previous zombie movie remake of dawn of the dead but his sucker punch left me high and dry even though the numerous dream action sequences were awesome so with hopeful and high expectations i went to see zaks re imagining of superman last night and i was blown away as was my wife and son as well as the other four people we went with ranging in age from kid teen and adults both male and female all of them loved it too so there ya go film critics again you got it all wrong this is quite easily director zak snyders most ambitious and biggest film of his career and his best take note hollywood even though your industry is banking on teens and tweens to go to the movies to make you your money us adults still go to the movies too especially when you make them like this 
i saw this movie in london s odeon in marble arch i absolutely loved it and can t wait for it to be released on disc it s the best superman to date in my opinion anyway the dvd and blu ray can t be released quick enough for me 
this is the best superman movie yet great special effects i like the little twists encorporated in the story great
in all respect to chris reeves this movie was awesome great computer graphics blended in with getting back to the root of super man the actor who played zorn stole the show great villian
i will admit i am leery about reboots of long familiar franchises spiderman superman batman but this movie managed to impress me its not a mere rehash of the classic superman mythos while the movie respects its roots the reboot gave superman a good backstory which is explained by jor el and what happened to the kryptonian race and planet one thing that surprised me was that this story does not include kryptonite which has long been used as supermans weakness some people might not like this since kryptonite has been such a big part of the superman mythos but i actually liked that they decided to get rid of this and focus on other things i also liked how they explained the s on supermans uniform while many things are changed from what most people know about superman i definitely feel that this was well done and i look forward to the next movie 
i dont usually leave movie reviews and i did not enjoy any of the previous superman movies but this one was fantastic if you have not seen it for any reason watch it you will not be disappointed 
its hard to remake superman these days batman taps into the deep psyche of vigilantism that has always haunted america but superman has come to embody a s style ideal of innocence that many feel no longer applies in a cynical modern world christopher nolan and david s goyer came up with a simple solution just show superman the way we would see him today and the reality of man of steel is that superman is terrifying he is all powerful all knowing and he lives among us he is in essence the ultimate terrorist is it any wonder america doesnt accept him at first with that perspective in mind man of steel does what other superhero movies have failed to do im looking at you green lantern and thats present a superhero in a realistic fashion kal el aka superman aka clark kent heny cavill is literally kryptons last hope but hes also a wanderer a cipher and yes a hero sprinkled throughout man of steel is flashbacks to the difficulty of growing up as an alien pretending to be a human shepherded by martha diane lane and jonathan kevin costner kent both of supermans father figures haunt him figuratively and literally to shape who superman was is and will be its compelling stuff but this is a superman movie not a batman movie so the potential for world shaking destruction is never far away in fact the level of destruction reaches uncomfortable levels those of us affected by will find those wounds reopened in the face of superheroes blithely ignoring the massive casualties around them its all filmed with a shaky cam tinged by the occasional faux lens flare demonstrating just what superman would look like exceeding the speed of sound man of steel takes the superman story and makes logical connections lois lane plucky amy adams is the logical person to track down the alien not because of her sassy attitude but because shes a good reporter tracking down a lead superman doesnt just decide to put on a cape he wears a mantle of leadership he willingly embraces and when superman comes face to face with zod michael shannon hes staring down the regimented hierarchy of his past goyer and nolan have pulled of a believable superman by making him a scary possibility to face and yet superman is woefully unprepared for his role as world savior as zod is fond of pointing out hes just a farm boy or is he supermans reintroduced to the dc film universe leaves metropolis and smallville irrevocably changed and if the other movies planned in the shared universe are any indication hopefully for the better 
man of steel is an a quality movie from start to finish is an engrossing movie experience that has a wonderful balance of story and action christopher nolans hand in this movie is very evident like nolans dark knight trilogy man of steel is a dark and serious movie start to finish the movie is driven by story and action and there are very few comedic moments in this movie and thankfully theres very little romance in this movie like batman begins and the star trek man of steel ignores prior movies in the series and is portrayed as a beginning story the tension between jor el and zod and later superman and zod is palpable the acting in this film was wonderful and the characters well performed and convincing then theres the story itself the struggle for self identity story clark kent goes through once on earth is very human and very well written the human element is much more present in this film than in superman returns the more notable presence of the human element and a much better story make this film soar above superman returns nolans plot has brought some of the brilliance the dark knight trilogy gave the batman series and brought it to the superman series and zack snyders directing gave us a wonderful action movie the action in this movie is flat out awesome and far superior to the action in superman returns the special effects and visuals are right on intense and realistic but not overdone man of steels wonderful balance of story and action and lack of romance make it an extremely satisfying movie both superman fans and general audiences should love man of steel this is everything youd want in a great summer blockbuster great movie out of stars easily 
lots of action and special effects i was pleasantly surprised that the whole superman story line did get told in the movie i know i will watch it a couple of more times characters are up to date good ones and bad ones 
now i enjoy x men spider man iron man and all of the avengers but for me they dont compare to batman and superman in fact after nolans dark knight trilogy i would rank man of steel as the second best of all the recent comic book turned movies i knew going in that the critics were nearly on the good and bad side of the fence so my expectations might have been lowered enough to prepare for the worst and surprised when it didnt happen the story begins with the same old origin of superman but there are enough little changes in the script and nice visual touches to make it seem fresh as expected the cgi fx and hans zimmers score are stunning throughout henry cavill makes for a good and believable superman and michael shannon plays a memorable villain in general zod russell crowe really surprised me with a strong emotional turn as jor el he is a good actor but his work of late has been rather weak i normally cant stand the character of lois lane but i like her here so that is saying something about amy adams its not perfect of course the narrative did not always gel jumping around too often and it ran for maybe minutes too long i saw it in digital d due to all the bad imax and d reviews it cut my ticket price in half and i didnt feel like i missed out also my full theater clapped and cheered loudly when it was over i had not heard a reaction like that in a long time with the million dollar opening weekend i feel this is but the first film of a trilogy that will probably get even better now that the foundation has been laid down and out of stars
man of steel delivers one of the most visual and dramatically rich films of the year brilliantly crafted and realized by director zach snyder the film wastes not a moment in weaving a complex tapestry that redefines the greatest superhero in history on an unheard of epic scale and make no mistake this is the superman of the st century director zach snyder and writer david s goyer have combined elements and touches of the most definitive superman comics and graphic novels of the characters last years to insure man of steel is a faithful reboot unlike bryan singers failed superman returns references and scenes abound from man of steel earth one secret origin battle of the supermen birthright last son of krypton secret identity and new krypton along with the new re launches of action comics and superman snyder and goyer also courageously mix in new mythological elements that address our own worlds controversial geo political issues all of which are grounded in the characters high morals and science fiction mythos those with pacemakers heart conditions or in walkers better get out of the way this is also st filmmaking at its best snyder has become one of the leading stylists in a new breed of directors who mix film stocks exposure speeds camera movement styles visual effects and processing textures for narrative purposes and hes never been more in tune with his gifts than he is here at times the tone and drama of the dialogue and performances fly at you just as fast as his visuals with each line and intonation as vital as his visual effects the extended opening on krypton is layered with as much philosophy religious contemplation and environmental debates as it is with stunning renderings of technology and creatures yet snyder takes time to slow down when emotion performances earthbound reality and narrative tone demand it writer david s goyer has structured his screenplay in a fashion similar to batman begins which he co authored with man of steel co producer and co story author christopher nolan while nolan maintained a consistent pace and stylistic approach in batman begins while cross cutting timelines in that film snyder utilizes stylistic shifts to allow his visuals to become a visceral extension of goyers screenplay structure and dialogue with regard to the films performances the casting could not be more perfect henry cavill embodies his triple roles as kal el clark kent and superman with levels of subtlety regret humanity humor compassion and above all humility he paces himself in each scene as evolution is the key demand of the role this is really a clark kent story as film reveals to clark just who he is and who he is destined to be in the first half cavill portrays a clark kent expressing loneliness heroism determination and yes wit and humor as he wanders the country struggling with a personal crisis who am i and what should i do once he discovers his kryptonian heritage and identity as kal el he suits up as superman tragically he must immediately face general zod and his troops cavill is a superman who has yet to be anointed with that name by the people of earth worse he has yet to gain their trust for the balance of the film we witness a superman learning how to use his powers protect the people of earth and realizing you must have faith in people first before trust can be established it is a lesson he instills on the us military those who most doubt his insistence he is a loyal american through and through by the end of the film cavill delivers audiences expectations of seeing the fully formed superman and clark kent amy adams lois lane is the exact embodiment of what wed expect from an aggressive pulitzer prize winning reporter she expresses hard edged yet beautiful humanity when she stumbles onto the story of the century only to realize she cant run it as it means ruining a mans life michael shannon brings to zod a level of depth beyond just rage and vengeance a key revelation in his character is a tragic one we learn that he faces fulfilling a destiny he did not choose for himself as clarks mother diane lane balances showing concern and fear for her son as his powers emerge and he begins questioning why god made him this way lane treats her kryptonian adopted son as she would any child hiding her fear and learning how to help her son control his powers her goal is that of all mothers teaching her son that childhood is just a phase of life not its end in the superman saga the most important parental figures have always been the fathers jor el and jonathan kent its the casting of russell crowe as jor el and kevin costner as jonathan kent that illustrate to audiences who clark is when we meet him and how he becomes superman by the end of the film in snyders man of steel it is done better than in any previous cinematic version of the character costners jonathan kent is a complex man upon learning young clark has saved a school bus full of his classmates from sinking into a river costner is angered insisting clark must keep his powers a secret when young clark asks him if he should have let them die costner honestly responds maybe he is a father desperate to protect his son from a world he knows is not ready to accept him a world he fears will turn its mightiest weapons against his son to kill him yet with each flashback featuring costners jonathan kent the wisdom he departs deepens as does the love he has for his son and costners jonathan kent imparts unto his son the ultimate example any father who truly believes in principles can showing your son that you stand behind them at all cost its the films most moving sequence russell crowes jor el is equally full of dimension his role in the film is not limited to his scenes on krypton when kal el finally discovers a way to download his fathers consciousness crowe plays the scenes with kindness reason and above all a powerful conviction of faith in his son crowe is able to balance acknowledging the burden his son will face as he reveals kal els kryptonian origins to him and the awesome responsibility jor el as a father is asking of kal el as a son to use his powers in becoming an inspiration and symbol of hope for the human race like costners jonathan kent crowe inspires confidence in his son by reinforcing principles there is a sense of consistency in the values of jonathan kent and jor el as played by costner and crowe a bridged gap that seems almost cosmic as if the two fathers are at once separate yet part of a whole this is not a superman for those clinging to the fleischer animated shorts the reeves tv series or the richard donner film and it doesnt need to be for those longing for those depictions of superman they will always exist wonderfully preserved on blu ray and dvd man of steel does not negate these past incarnations and it shouldnt audiences should always treasure these previous versions of superman yet the vitriol and anger expressed by critics and some superman fans against man of steel mystifies the accusation that the last hour of the film is just an over the top empty bombastic visual effects laden disaster movie not true theres as much drama character development and emotion to be found in these scenes as there is in the rest of the film furthermore the films climax is a toned down version of many modern superman pg animated films graphic novels and comic book sagas including the classic the death of superman story in the dc animated universe division released a direct to video film of this story entitled superman doomsday rated pg it contained more killings violence brutal action sequences destroyed cities and adult content than man of steel and its running time was only minutes i can only imagine what critics and many superman fans would be saying this weekend had warner bros chosen to release that year old animated film instead of man of steel 
this is a story thats been told so many times your first thought is oh no not again but the in depth look at an alternate world combined with the unique physics of the fight scenes make this a mesmerizing and very personal kind of film i highly recommend it 
this is superman as i always envisioned him i found this to be truly a super film and arguably the best film visualization of the character yet weve come a long way from the superman seriel columbia gave us around 
this is the superman film youve been waiting for ill admit i was worried if snyder and nolan who were so successful at portraying darker heroes were the right team for this the previews made it look as though the film would be filled with angst and there would be an over emphasis on this superman as outsider concept hes not batman hes not spider man hes superman but the film is all about how superman is introduced to earth and finally becomes accepted they pull in elements from nearly all the previous versions of superman there are nods to john byrnes revision mark waids birthright smallville and straczynskis superman earth one the villians are as im sure you know the phantom zone criminals led by general zod and faora overall the acting was well done lois isnt quite as aggressive as shes been in recent years but shes an improvement over kate boswell lex makes no appearnce in the film but if you pay attention youll see the word lexcorp top notch special effects of course and ive already almost gotten used to the no shorts uniform since ive been reading the recent comics so what will they do with justice league and since i dont want to spoil my review with negativity ill shift my nit picks to the comments section 
christopher nolan does it again finally hollywood portrays comic book characters how they were originally written tim burtons portrayals of batman were pathetic and once again nolan shines through with the best superman movie ever made in d its off the charts with surround the sound effects are outstanding i give this movie a star rating 
i love the collectors edition dthis one especially im a big fan of superman i have the originals movies in the special edition dvds br boxs and i had to have this one to di dont have much to say if you are like me just buy it d its look very very beautiful in my ledge dvds
the wait for a truly amazing superman film is over great acting great musical score great effects great premise and moral simply perfect 
i admit to being a bit of an addict when it comes to user reviews on amazon while movie critics often rehash the same old cliches and viewpoints filtered through the pseudo sophisticated lens of reminding everyone that this is a comic book movie user reviews can get deeper and more interested in the guts of these films and generally treat them with far greater reverence why the need to mention this simply man of steel has to be the most dissected film since watchmen interesting that both are zack snyder films i cannot remember many other films that have such polarizing responses to them when it comes to the comic book versions of superman i am still scratching the surface when i visit either the comic shop or barnes noble its generally batman that dominates the shelves couple this with superman being the type of character he has been over the years the shade of each story arc can vary greatly while something like earth one gets to the true essence of the character there also exists a version where superman is wearing an apron and doing housework overall the superman that everyone knows and loves can be quite different as for the film itself this is handily my favorite of any live action version of superman to me this is an adult take on the man of steel while still being available for viewing to the kids who are now growing to admire superman this reboot is about a stranger in a strange land who is trying to understand how and why he has powers that his peers do not the entre crux of the story felt like clark kents journey inward to make sense of the person he is on the outside and like any comic book film worth its weight it has more than one iconic moment that if you felt as i did will leave you with chills much has been made of the spectacle that takes place in act and while i believe some of it to be valid and interesting in its way a good amount of it can be thought of us a reimagining of the downtown fight scene of superman fully realized when you consider two men who can lift a car over their head with one hand the idea of them crashing through a building makes more sense for my money it felt massive and enjoyable i have been anxiously awaiting the chance to view man of steel again second viewings can sometimes shatter the pedestal of fresh eyes but it can also cement the esteem you felt the first time i am betting on the latter 
finally let me start by saying this i cant stand professional critics they act like theyre sooo super smart no pun i dont think they know what good and bad movies are of the time we totally disagree dont listen to them judge for yourself this was awesome best superman movie ive seen and yes i grew up in the christopher reeves era i still enjoy superman the first was always just ok to me but never has superman reached his potential on film not like other superheroes have until now theres no comparison i dont feed on nostalgia i still love my old classics but some newer interpretations are simply better this had a good story and nicely paced origin retelling great comicbook style action about time and i love the smart way of how clark kent can maintain his secret identity they did it also in smallville makes more sense for the critics and few other naysayers i dont think they are or ever will be ready for a true superman movie like we just got want to live in the past live in the past the s s i prefer this version no one has to agree with me this is my firm opinion and i will continue to stand by mine very pleased that is all no description needed see it for yourself 
a shockingly good version of the superman myths when this first was announced i questioned dcs decision not to simply spin off superman from a smallville movie but man of steel differs enough from smallville and the donner films to give reason for its existence henry cavill is another great superman in a strong legacy amy adams is astounding as lois lane and while entertainment weekly has gone out of its way to destroy this film you should know that their reasoning is faulty this makes sense as pure science fiction and as a tale of heroism

i dont know where the critics are coming from i am a superman fan so i would embrace any superman movie but this one is different they finally listened to the fans and gave us a movie full of action and story they couldnt have picked a better cast absolutely a fabulous job from each cast member there were parts that made this grown man cry and there were parts that made you want to cheer this movie flowed well and fast when the ending came i wanted more and i am hoping this is the start of many movies to come this movie didnt even seem like a hour movie an outstanding movie and well worth the wait i cant tell you how happy i am to see hollywood do justice to the superman universe and story as a matter fact i will be going twice on this the only dissapointment i had was the theater was packed and i was forced to sit close to the screen not the best experience but that is not man of steels fault there was only one movie i paid to see twice in the theater and that was the original spiderman back in man of steel will be the next i will be going back once the hype dies down i will be buying this movie when it is released i would pay dollars just to rent and watch it in the comfort of my home if i could streaming through the internet take my money i am so glad they are making a fortune on this movie i hope they can make two fortunes because it is well deserved thank you to the movie studio for bringing my favorite childhood super hero back to life thank you for introducing him to a new and younger generation years old and superman still lives 
man of steel is an amazing reboot to superman and one of the best comic book movies ever made man of steel is one of my favorite films of all times along with the dark knight trilogy man of steel inspired me to be a better person and value my family even more 
i went with my mom and some friends to see this movie we walked in after getting popcorn and drinks we walked it and it was packed we barely found a seat that we could sit together there are some great actors and actresses in this movie some you will know from other movies and tv shows i loved it i was secpital because we wented the dark knight rises and it had high ratings and we didnt like it so i was secpital about this movie but i am glad i went to see it you will love it but it doesnt start out like the other super man movies and tv shows does that is just a heads up 
i really enjoyed this movie and learned a whole lot more about supermans background you will enjoy this film recommended
for me this was the best superman movie ever by putting more time into kryptons history and showing more of the background information made it more interesting i think the adults would like this version as much if not more than the youngsters 
best super man ever i really like watching this superman was very good i would tell everyone to watch this movie
this is the modern superman film that we have been waiting for i cannot emphasize that enough it is not a flawless masterpiece in spite of the obvious similarities and parallels this is not on quite the same level as batman begins however it absolutely gets the conceptual approach that was needed to take this character and re launch him as a realistic real world entity in the heavier landscape of the twenty first century not everyone likes this but that just goes to demonstrate an ideological divide among viewers superman has spent far too long chained to nostalgia for either his s s origins and or the aesthetic and tone of richard donners iconic film even in superman returns was looking decades back into the past for inspiration not that there is anything wrong with reveling in a franchises heritage but that should never consume a character man of steel takes the core concepts and brings them forward to the present and it does a wonderful job of it i used the word realistic a few sentences back of course a being with superhuman powers is not a real thing in our world but this film is science fiction it is a first contact story designed to show how such an event might play out if it did occur thus the characters all of them including superman and the other the kryptonians act and react like real people because they are real people this version of krypton involves more of a focus on technology but it is just advanced technology not magic as the saying goes any sufficiently advanced technology at first seems that way again i do not consider this film a masterpiece the script could be better for one thing and some of the editing is a bit jumpy and so forth but the thing is man of steels virtues far far far outweigh any of its weaknesses it is beautifully rendered in the cinematography and visual effects wonderfully cast with a group of terrific actors and contrary to what some may say has substantial heart and emotion at its core there is the issue of the ending but for me it is a complete non issue again this is intended to be a realistic take on superman he is not a god he is not immune to mistakes or shortcomings and he is just starting to fully embrace the implications of his heritage and his abilities when everything goes crazy and the earth and humanity are basically in danger of destruction nothing about what happens contradicts the identity of the character those who disown this film because of the levels of action or destruction are completely missing the point if i may be so bold as to say so the main thing is that in spite of its imperfections man of steel is a very special film it is a new type of superhero film it looks different feels different is different we are fortunate that we were not given just another cartoonish episode or just a retread of what has already been done in the past this is the opening chapter of a new world not everyone will love it or appreciate its qualities but this mythology is moving forward and i am energized and inspired to be along for the ride if you have not seen it yet approach it with an open mind treat it like it is really happening and it may very well take you someplace beautiful and meaningful 
this movie is great escapism get yourself lost in a sci fi action movie that has no bearing on real life cool special effects and a story you can follow youll want this in your blu ray collection especially the limited edition digi book 
im not a movie snob im somewhat easily entertained im not the type who is going to tear a movie apart because of the central figures past works superman that is nor will i figure its so much better just because it was created later and has much better graphics this movie was just an all around enjoyable movie i enjoyed the casting selections and thought the movie had a perfect pace to it its one of the few movies i own that i cant wait to watch again 
i was a skeptic about them reinventing the wheel so to speak i enjoyed the original movie series with christopher reeve so i had doubts about whether i would actually like this it was done very well and i truly enjoyed it 
the best movie ever made this is the superman i have been waiting to see since i was a kid 
first and foremost i respect the reeve films and i even respect singers returns nonetheless they were far from perfect and now that man of steel has been made i can never see myself going back to any other superman film here is why the cast whether it be costner or crowe adams or lane the cast was top notch and treated this superman with respect did i leave out cavill cavill had many doubters asking themselves why when he was cast though after this films release i couldnt imagine anyone doubting him anymore cavill was top notch and above and beyond what i expected he is the man of steel one could nitpick this film like many others star wars etc but not i and in my eyes man of steel is a perfect superman film and it deserves a perfect score the director say what you will about zack snyder but he does know action and very much knows how to treat an audience visually and despite some claiming he cannot develop character well he can he really had a strong vision as to what david goyer and nolan had come up with and despite speculation well this is snyders baby and it was as soon as the script was in his hands if you watched or watchmen and then man of steel and still feel you must doubt him then that is to bad as he is one of hollywoods best blockbuster directors the writers while the screenplay was written by david goyer christopher nolan helped with the story both whom worked as writer director respectively in the dark knight trilogy having said that i need not say anything more they are top notch and have proven it many times my review was not intended to state the obvious about the plot or give spoilers instead i will say that if you think you were a superman fan before watching this just wait because once man of steel is over youll feel like a kid again everyone from the cast writers director all gave it their all and imo made the best superman to date stars 
this is a superman for a new generation and an old one as well a great origin story and a great reboot for the man of steel and this time a fights superpowered villians one thing i will say is that marvel may have some competition real soon lets hope that steel and wonderwoman supergirl and greenlantern get movies in the future 
after a mediocre iron man and a good but not great star trek into darkness both films being nothing more than entertaining roller coaster rides which is fine for some viewers but not for me man of steel delivers not just the requisite ride which is expected of all summer blockbuster movies but a good story and a christian message to boot henry cavill immortals the tudors gives us a version of superman that is naturalistic and emotional as opposed to christopher reeves take from the s that was stiff and two dimensional with the script david s goyer batman begins dark knight dark knight rises introduces us to a darkly realistic superman one full of introspection and doubts full of past hurts and pain and yet determinedly hopeful christopher nolan batman begins dark knight dark knight rises started production on the film and then turned it over to zack snyder to direct i had my doubts about this triumvirate nolan snyder goyer simply because superman is not batman and these guys had batman in their blood has that same dark knight kind of feel dc comics superman is a character very much like marvel comics captain america you could almost add him to the list of baseball hot dogs and moms apple pie hes all american and hes uncomplicated batman on the other hand is darkly complex a psychological roadmap of twists and turns i was afraid they would turn this simple refreshing character into a dark knight clone but delightedly they did not what they did do surprisingly is give us superman as a christ figure the son of man as the man of steel man of steel is fraught with christian symbols where this came from i do not know because while there is a lot of spirituality in comics and graphic novels and much of it christian i dont think its this blatant i know that superman is the most righteous of all the superheroes again like captain america who is also full of virtue and a model for boys to follow but to think of him as a christ figure is to take him to a new level yet there it is throughout the film superman is christ substitute supermans muscles for christs spirit kansas for galilee and metropolis for jerusalem and you have in essence the same story the salvation of mankind by a dual nature being fully god and fully man superman is a savior the first thing that tipped me off was the scene where jor el russell crowe and his wife are putting the baby kal el into a spaceship destined for earth in order to save him from the destruction of the planet krypton i thought that is moses being placed in the reed basket and sent down the river nile think about it hes being sent away from destruction to a people with which he has nothing in common in order to save them that was not only the calling of moses it was the calling of christ notice that both kal els name and that of his father jor el end in el el in hebrew means god i doubt if that was an accident like jesus kal el clark was raised by an adopted father in his case jonathan kent kevin costner kent instills in his son the idea of always being a force for good and of always doing the right thing he warns clark that people may not accept him and that theyll probably be afraid of him because of his powers and so he needs to keep his identity a secret this is not unlike christs warning to his disciples not to make his identity known superman begins his career of saving people at the age of so did jesus he begins as an itinerant worker jesus began as an itinerant preacher both men did so partly to conceal their identities and partly to avoid their enemies superman discovers his origins and purpose from his fathers facsimile in an arctic outpost moses did the same thing from a burning bush and it could be argued that jesus discovered these things during his days and nights in the wilderness such a briefing could be said to be a rite of passage a spiritual rite of passage every believer and every great character in literature and film has one it is what defines them superman is such a character i really like the fact that the story of superman has a grunge phase which is what his time as an itinerant worker is it makes his story more real i also like how the filmmakers tell his backstory using flashbacks its far more effective than if they had just told a straight chronological story because it relates those events to his present sufferings when clark finally becomes superman hes spectacular as you would imagine hes got the hair the muscles and the cape but he has more than that one of the things we discover in his conversations with lois lane is the meaning of the s on his chest it isnt an s for superman rather its the symbol for hope on the planet krypton superman represents hope thats what christ represents as well as superman henry cavill has it over christopher reeve hands down not only is he more comfortable with his muscles reeve was stiff and bulky but hes a far better actor he has some very emotional scenes and is very believable in them his relationship with lois lane amy adams works well as far as chemistry in the analogy with christ we are lois lane the one he loves the one he saves time and time again the one he would die for the best part of clark kent is his struggle with himself his attempt to reconcile his two natures and thereby decide where his allegiances lie with the remnant of krypton who are basically the bad guys or with residents of his new home earth of course he chooses the latter trust is a prime motif in man of steel i already mentioned clarks fathers advice about not trusting people with his identity in one scene clark is in a church seeking answers to the question of who he is and what he should be as hes leaving the pastor in a desperate attempt to help blurts out something to the effect of trust people later when superman is finally recognized by colonel nathan hardy christopher meloni as a friend not an enemy he says something to the effect of i trust you trust is the foundation in any relationship and certainly with both the man of steel and the son of man in man of steel theres the obligatory violence as superman fights against the bad guys the only other survivors from the destroyed planet krypton who are traitors exiled from the planet for insurrection the leader of this group general zod michael shanno is not my favorite villain of all time there is nothing compelling about him and the final showdown with superman is over kill in my opinion it would have been just as effective and the movie could have been brought in at hours run time instead of by having him die with his compatriots must every action adventure movie end with a final showdown in this case i dont think it was needed one of my favorite scenes is the last one i wont be giving anything away if i say that it is when clark kent shows up at the daily planet for the first time wearing his glasses obviously promising a sequel i thought now that is clark kent at last an actor who can pull off both superman and clark kent without one of them seeming ridiculous bravo final note ive mentioned before how edgar rice burroughs tarzan is a cultural christ figure http www waitsel com classic literature tarzan html well so is superman as such i think hes also a symbol of righteousness http www christianknighthood com righteousness html both of these characters came out of the early part of the th century reflecting the values of americans at that time can we recapture those we need to and this film definitely gives promise to that hope 
i enjoyed this film at the theater and couldnt wait to watch it again at home the casting was great the actors were superb the special effects were on the money the story was great the extras on the dvd set were interesting and enjoyable 
this was a great version of superman very close to reeves version i loved it from beginning to end i dont know what movie a lot of reviewers watched but they were not watching man of steel fabulous movie 
after a severe rough patch in the road for science fiction in general farscape and firefly fall victim to a fatal form of the same disease network myopia theres something to cheer about i have rated fewer than a dozen books or movies at stars in the last years i have never been hooked so hard so fast by a tv show regardless of genre the individual characters gave me that kitten with a ball of yarn feeling i have to know more add lots of action and the creators signature rapid fire often slicing and usually unexpected character interaction and i thought i was about to escape from network sitcom reality show hell unfortunately it didnt last there is room in good scifi for all kinds over the years ive enjoyed more so called mainstream scifi such as star wars trek and gate sg b and countless others for different reasons unfortunately far more have landed in the mediocre to sub sewage categories firefly was one of the few that appealed to my taste for something further out on the edge a little dark definitely adult often laugh out loud funny no laugh track required where everything may not be what it appears or it just might be something you have to work at a little to understand but always beautifully written and acted if that might also interest you i strongly recommend this series in whatever form it is available wherever whenever my husband and i agreed were getting the dvd as soon as its available then well worry about getting a dvd player serenity definitely deserves to keep flying 
firefly is one of the most fiercely loved cult television shows ever made and it greatly deserves to be in its abbreviated only season it managed to produce such a memorably palpable universe and set of characters that it was eventually allowed to continue its story in a film version serenity that did not do as well as hoped in its theatrical release but that has enjoyed enough success on its dvd run that it has produced a whole new set of fans curious about the original show myself included its central idea is elegantly simple set in a future analogous to the reconstruction after the american civil war a group of renegades led by a soldier on the rebellions losing side try to make ends meet by accepting dubious work smuggling goods and even sometimes pulling heists in a very corruptly run political system the brooding romantic captain and his cohort form the nucleus of the band with her jokester husband a tough hired muscle a sweet tempered mechanic a stiff doctor his mysterious and emotionally disturbed younger sister and an extremely ethical preacher forming the rest of the group oh and of course in this homage to john fords stagecoach there is also a state licensed prostitute with a heart of gold whose ongoing bantering love hate relationship with the captain forms one of the highlights of the entire series and seems surprisingly fresh the episodes are written more like miniature films than typical television hour long shows and theres usually a fine sense of atmosphere moreover the special effects are surprisingly sophisticated and convincing the tone from episode to episode can shift dramatically from very jokey episodes to very haunting or grim ones the shows creator joss whedon is best known for his earlier series buffy the vampire slayer but firefly is surprisingly quite different in style and type from buffy although it retains the very best things about that earlier and more widely popular series the strong and original characters the funny and unexpected banter and most of all the emphasis on community and on heart 
first off i havent seen the firefly series and even after the movie serenity came out i ignored it however due to the repeated recommendations of amazon i decided to check it out at my local store and boy i didnt realize what i was missing if youre a star wars fan partial to weird west cartoons like trigun bravestarr and the more recent gun x sword and lapped up the pc game privateer a decade ago firefly is a must see tv it also echoes the venerable star trek franchise with the crew dropped in mostly illegal situations during their voyages however firefly transcends them all with its witty characterizations uncontrived plot twists brisk pacing and all around energy i would not go into the plots since its mostly covered by the editorial and customer reviews but one thing i noticed about the firefly series is its refreshing lack of space battles in fact the ship serenity itself has no guns and that is a major twist in space based tv shows the show hits all the geek notes in the right way from a roguish crew evil corporations criminal lowlifes and even lesbian kissing its almost like han solo the series but better the dvd set itself is way way excellent aside from humorous and enlightening commentaries from joss whedon it features the aforementioned final three episodes deleted scenes and a gag reel one caveat though for parents firefly contains sex scenes you cannot label it suggested sex scenes since you can see them doing it clearly theres no other way you can interpret it otherwise hey im not complaining and other scenes of sensitive nature the violence part is surprisingly tame for my standards even the torture scenes but there is a substantial chunk in the series overall after seeing the series you will wonder what were the fox executives thinking when they cancelled an excellent series like firefly good thing theres dvd and movie franchises to make up for capriciousness and ignorance of network executives 
i had never heard of this series i ordered the dvd set on a lark i have always like science fiction and have looked for film video adaptations i have usually been disappointed but i keep trying finding a gem like this one makes the effort worth while the basic premise is of the crew of a tramp freighter who make their way by carrying freights the occasional smuggling job and a few other less than legal operation these are invariably conducted against people who deserve to have been on the losing side the captain and first mate are old war buddies they were both on the losing side of a civil war the mate is married to the ships pilot the ships engineer is a sweet somewhat nave and technically competent young lady a tough mercenary type rounds out the regular crew in the first episode they take on a series of passengers one of them is a shepherd which is a sort of itinerant christian priest he has a mysterious past we never really learn about a brother and sister also come on board the brother is a highly skilled surgeon and the sister is a genius who had secret experiments run on her by government agents they are on the run from the same government agents the other permanent passenger is a courtesan she leases one of the ships shuttles as her place of business while the crew is doing their thing she does hers much of this series seems like a cowboy picture right down to the horses saloons and brothels in a strange way it works well in the context of the series it is well done i am very sorry that the series was cancelled because it is very good synopses of the episodes appear below serenity the crew of the serenity agrees to pick up a less than legal cargo but gets stiffed on their fee when they try to deliver it unless they can find somewhere to sell it they wont have the cash for parts fuel salary or anything else so they try to less it on some border areas to help pay the way they take on some passengers also one of the passengers turns out to be smuggling a fugitive and another is a federal agent sent to bring in everyone i get the impression that the government types are not very nice when you throw in a courtesan some cannibals and a preacher things get interesting the train job this one seems more like a western but doesnt suffer from that the crew is hired to rob a train on a frontier planet the goods they are hired to purloin belong to the federation government so no one really minds or things it is wrong they also enjoy doing the job right under the noses of federation troops the crew doesnt really know what they are stealing it is only when the train gets to it destination that they learn that they have stolen desperately needed medical supplies the leads the crew to try to return the goods without getting caught by the feds or the crime boss they were doing job for this is to be done while the crew is still be pursued by the secret government agency from whom one of the passengers escaped its a good and exciting episode bushwhacked while doing nothing in particular the crew of the serenity encounter a derelict floating in space when they go aboard they find that the crew has been slaughtered by the reevers cannibal lunatics mentioned in the first episode they left one survivor and a valuable cargo the crew attempts to help the survivor and salvage the cargo but their efforts are interrupted by a federation ship the captain of that ship assumes that it is the crew of the serenity who committed the atrocities the crew have to protect themselves establish their innocence and hide the fugitives who have become passengers shindig the crew returns to the planet persephone where the series started they are looking for business opportunities as usual and a possibility pops up the captain sees an opportunity for a smuggling run and goes to make contact at a fancy party hosted by the local gentry to keep this episode interesting innarra the staff courtesan has a date with a local bigwig he and the captain have a bit of a tiff and wind up in a duel with swords there is not a lot of call for swords on spaceships safe in seems that nothing can go right the crew of the serenity make planetfall with the consignment of cattle they picked up in the last episode and are about to collect their payment then things go wrong as they inevitably must the local law shows up to arrest the cattle buyers just as the money is changing hands and the crew get involved in the shootout they help out the law but the parson gets himself shot very seriously shot the only two missing from the scene are the two fugitives who have wandered off the captain thinks they might get in the way of the deal making but now the doctors services are needed unfortunately he and his sister have gotten themselves kidnapped by some religious types who live in the hills they are glad to have the doctor but they think the sister is a witch and must burn saving the preacher and rescuing the siblings proves to be a sticky situation our mrs reynolds somehow we dont really know how the crew of the serenity find themselves helping a rural community defend themselves from bandits after the big celebration the crew get back on board take of and find that they have an extra passenger it seems that according to the local customs the captain has gotten himself married that is news to everyone the young girl is seemingly nave but she is not what she seems someone wants the serenity for scrap jaynestown jayne cobb is perhaps the least likeable member of the serenity crew he is selfish not too bright and always ready to fight he has a long history of leaving planets behind while being on the run in this episode the crew sets down to pick up an illicit cargo and jayne is worried because he knows he left the place on the run he adopts a disguise much to everyones surprise everyone learns that jayne cobb has become a folk hero to the people on the planet complete with a statue in the public square all of this came about because of a misunderstanding he never intended to help those people he did it by accident but he is still a hero heroes have people who dont like them and on this planet that include the local magistrate out of gas most series wait until at least the second season before having a retrospective episode this one takes place halfway through the first season but it has a difference instead of recycling footage from old episodes this one has all new footage the situation involves a serious mechanical failure while the ship is in transit life support is failing and the captain sends his crew off in the two shuttles while he stays aboard to try and fix things while this is going on we are treated to flashback showing how the crew came to be assembled ariel when the mysterious female passenger with mental problems starts getting worse her brother the doctor comes up with a seemingly simple scheme to serve everyones needs the crew is to help the doc smuggle sis into a hospital for some tests and the doc agrees to help them steal some high dollar drugs to sell on the fringe planets these are not recreational pharmaceuticals but vital medicines in short supply the plan seems to work smoothly until treachery becomes apparent war stories in the second episode the crew is hired to pull a train heist they pull it off but when all is said and done they find that they dont want to keep the goods the natives need the stolen medications more than the crew needs the money this is all good and noble and such but it hacks of the crime boss who put them up to it the crew returned the money but the boss wants revenge in this episode he manages to capture the captain and the pilot it is up to the rest of the crew to get them out trash a few episodes back the captain got himself accidentally married the blushing bride turned out to be a con woman and they only barely got away with their lives and their ship this time at a smuggler rendezvous the captain runs into an old war buddy who happens to have gotten himself married to the same piece of trash when the story comes out the wife gets stranded captain mal is about to strand her as well but she manages to talk him into one of her schemes naturally the lady has an angle of her own make that lots of angles and curves and treachery the crew has a few ideas of their own but nothing is going to go as planned the message when the crew stops at a station for a mail call they get a surprise a corpse has been mailed to the captain and zo the corpse turns out to be an old war buddy his last request is that the serenity take him home for burial things are not as they seem however the corpse is not dead instead he is smuggling body parts and there are other who want the parts without the rest of the body as everyone turns on everyone else over conflicting loyalties the situation gets tense heart of gold when inarra the courtesan gets a distress call she talks the crew of serenity into helping an old friend of hers who is the madam of a bordello on a backwater planet a local powerbroker with a barren wife want to sire an heir on one of the house girls he manages to plant his crop and intends to claim it by force the crew intend to prevent that and a good time is had by most objects in space river the female fugitive continues to get more and more erratic this troubles the crew who fear not only for themselves but for her as well things are not helped in that there is a very large reward for her capture this tends to promote suspicion with many of the people with which they deal in this episode a bounty hunter manages to sneak aboard and waylay the crew one by one river though is not without her own methods 
warning contents highly addictive and maddening you will wonder why oh why this was ever cancelled it is clearly the highest caliber show of shows with great cast sets dialog you name it firefly has it except more episodes with all the reality dumbing down nonsense that is the norm nowadays this little outer space cowboy show that is superbly written and acted is a true gem the cast is scattered to all ends of this verse but we the faithful can hope that with josss success with the screenplay and directing of the avengers that his hollywood cache can propel at least another movie out of this stunning show browncoat faithful now and always youre on my crew why are we still talking about this 
hearing how fans were fairly rabid about this series i decided to pick it up based on all the raves i finished watching all the episodes and special features from the dvds last night all i have to say is wow i mean seriously wow i thought after watching battlestar galactica that nobody could ever make a compelling lifelike show with a space theme in it firefly definately lives up to the hype once i started with the first episode serenity also the name of the upcoming movie in september of this year i was hooked to sum it up the series background is a twist of western and space sounds corny its not to make a better analogy in my mind is that the human race is heavily colonizing planets and thusly has a go west young man feel as joss whedon summarized in the special features its about throwing nine people into space on their own and getting nine different perspectives of what that would be like the background of the world is never overwhelming in the sense this series is first and foremost about the characters it gets to the point where you dont care about the cool space stuff or planets but what is going to happen to each person next what can i say about the cast amazing casting each person is just perfect for the role i wont really say too much about the characters other than they are all very well tailored and unique and throughout the episodes you get on this dvd collection you will see each one fleshed out well and clammering for more if you arent convinced about the reviews here you can catch it on sci fi channel at pm est sci fi is rebroadcasting the series mostly in part due to the upcoming serenity release it is truly a shame this series ended so soon it had all the qualities of a great tv series possibly with the introduction to serenity in theatres it will be reborn back into our living rooms 
with over reviews im not exactly going to be forging new territory here except to add to the hum of me too if youre reading this then you already know that firefly was a short lived western themed tv sci fi series and that this description hardly begins to describe it as a show the eternal debate among fanboys is over which show is best is it b with its story arc is it bsg with its relentless darkness is it farscape doctor who trek blakes in that debate firefly with a mere episodes has to be seriously considered cut off before it really got going well never really know what the series would have been but we are left with an amazing mini series that is eminently watchable each episode in fact is a nifty piece of television im one of the few that found and watched firefly in its original run where the story arc made no sense because the episodes were shown out of order there is humor here and there is some poignancy but what always strikes me is the sense of realism that was forged the sets and effects are not what im talking about its the characters for example in the intended first episode serenity the captain makes a series of decisions that result in the doctor remaining on board but each of these decisions is utterly real the captain really would have killed him if one of the other characters had died and late in the episode he plays a practical joke on the doctor by telling her shes died which is pitch perfect it is a mark of pure craftsmanship that good writing and characterization runs through every episode so i got tired of tivoing the re runs on the sci fi channel and ordered up the dvds theyre nicely packaged and youll enjoy them many times over firefly is a small gem but a brilliant one 
after catching most of the shows on tv i was disappointed actually really upset and cussing when it was canceled a year and a half later as im browsing through the rows of dvds i find the complete series so i bought it then i felt my fascination with the show come back to life after the first episode of serenity two days pass and ive watched all the episodes along with the special features and am starting over a google search reveals universal is in works to make a tv movie called serenity set for release in go brown coats 
firefly is like no other television program only lasting one year with episodes randomly thrown on strange nights on fox this series boasted a classic combination of science fiction with a western flair how could it go wrong a humorous program that had fun fought bad guys and harbored extremely dark secrets why did it only last one season marketing fox as we all can learn from my review of outfoxed is not quite the fair and balanced type of programming that it promotes but instead attaches itself to the hottest trend and pushes it nearly to the point of sickness for those that would disagree i ask you to check out how many predictable seasons of american idol we will have to endure until someone realizes that it lost its steam a many a moon ago or how about the disaster of a series called wife swap honestly did fox just ignore the idea of creativity and push directly for insulting reality television from what i see on television today i could only assume the answer to be yes firefly was a bold unique and highly original series that gave us powerful characters detailed stories and that lost itch in the back of your mind that keeps you asking that age old question why yet in all of its power it was cancelled firefly is perfection on a stick the twang of the guitar the stone face stare of mal the goofiness of jayne is that a girls name the questionable past of shepard book the humor of wash the power of zoe and the innocence of kaylee is exactly why i fell in love with this show this is honestly one of the few series that i could go back from the beginning and watch again loving every moment of it whedon created a masterpiece in my eyes and a huge opportunity was missed by several major networks to keep this imagination alive while some will argue that firefly was full of nothing more than c rated actors who were shallow cut outs and whose dialogue never rises above the level of a so so sitcom i thought that they brought so much personality and charisma to a smorgasbord of unoriginal programming i wanted to know the truth behind river and the darkness behind the good shepard i continually waited for a snappy comeback from mal and was excited whenever he showed humility jayne was a big favorite of mine always questioning authority yet as loyal as the family dog the love between zoe and wash brought a new layer of honesty to this sci fi series it wasnt just about paying for the ship flying through unmapped terrain or stealing it was about humanity that sense of humanity could be found in the opening episode for this series aptly titled serenity in it the crew takes upon some passengers with some rather unknown cargo inside one of those crates is a girl that will change their lives forever for this series to work successfully as it did we needed human characters that bled felt compassion and demonstrated connectiveness to each of us mals ship serenity was a living example of how television could be done creatively and originally the characters could only be as strong as the words that were handed to them listening to the words that pass through mals mouth the charm of wash or even the inconsistent ramblings of river you could only wonder where whedon could have gone with all of them in each of these characters whedon had written secrets while sadly we may never know what they all were that is what made you itch for more episodes you not only wanted to see the creative western adventures that whedon was sending his crew but you also wanted to learn more about these band of renegades they were good but possibly darkness reigned inside of them the character most guilty of this outside of river was shepard book i loved this character whedon drew him with so much passion and conviction yet with every episode you learned more about this man than imaginable he is an excellent example of what this series was like he represented the smart words of whedon the humanity of his character and the secrets that each of these shared he was a priest yet he knew more about the alliance than anyone aboard that ship if anyone were to ask me to describe the series in two words i would simply say shepard book george lucas is credited with creating this detailed futuristic world that gives us glimpses of a possible future or a galaxy far far away whedon succeeded in this series by giving us a plausible future in the not too distant future of years prostitution in legal in fact respected in the community the chinese and americans have forged one super power called the alliance and our hero is a war veteran still not shaken by the loss that his side took due to the alliance control while lucas gives us far fetched characters and situations whedon gives us a imaginative look at our future i think that is why this series worked so well for me i could imagine this future i could see it past the characters i wasnt bogged down by dopey looking aliens but instead a plausible man vs man situation firefly was simple yet so complex i could honestly go on forever about how much i enjoyed this show i have never watched a series where i found myself prepared to watch over and over again firefly blends a power mixture of comedy western and action all together and the characters bleed villains die in this series how often do you see that if you have not watched this series or have not spent the money to support it do it right now grade proudly out of 
i understand that not everyone is keen on science fiction and further that many would giggle at a scifi western so i guess it didnt surprise me that somehow firefly was given a terrible timeslot and was dispatched before the first season was even finished those of us who gave firefly a chance were absolutely bereft when it was taken from us we stayed home on friday nights or we exercised our vcrs and tivos we took it on faith that just as buffy did not turn out to be with vampires so too would this not turn out to be the lone ranger with spaceships and we were right to do so it was witty and charming fun and interesting after a few episodes we gave a damn about the characters it had the potential to be another buffy for joss whedon in my opinion it already was alas it was science fiction very expensive to produce when produced as well as firefly was and not geared to appeal to the lowest common denominator so in tough economic times it was cancelled in favor of inexpensive and popular reality television if you like joss whedons other work buy these dvds and watch every episode even though youll lack closure in the end youll be glad you did try it youll understand then join the rest of us in wishing joss luck getting a firefly movie off the ground 
fox was so unfair to firefly they didnt air the episode in order they played the third episode first how dumb is that people were very confused and they did a horrible job of advertising it fox really screwed the pooch on this one it was an awesome show im just sad that it got canned before they showed several of the episodes i am glad that joss got to make the movie serenity which is a continuation of the tv show but i would have like the show brought back this is an awesome show 
i bought the series after i watched by pure chance the serenity movie a friendly salesperson in a moviestore i use recommended the movie i loved it and after finding out that it was based on the cancelled series bought the boxed set the series are marvelous wonderful characters very good acting good settings nice balance of heroic and ridiculous real emotions and real reactions to developing situations i lately feel fed up with grandiose special effects and fireflys gritty feeling of frontier reality was wonderfully refreshing the thing to do for fox would be to re start the series while the cast is still available and close in age to the firefly crew i write this from russia would fox be interested to know that a lot of people here bought the boxed set and ther are some real browncoats in moscow this is definitely one of the best shows i have ever seen and the best sf so far 
theres not really much i can add that hasnt already been said i will say this though i introduced firefly to the guys gals in my office and every one of them went out and bought a copy for themselves ive watched it all the way through three times and cant wait to watch it again i sure hope they at least give us a serenity ii 
tv is often referred to as the idiot box the lobotomy box or worse intelligent folks or at least folks who want to sound intelligent are always disparaging the junk on tv to be sure they have a point with the proliferartion of garbage on the box its easy to overlook a real gem in a sea of manure firefly is that gem i never got to see the show when it was broadcast and i guess i should be thankful for that had i discovered it and gotten hooked only to have it yanked out from under me would have been an extreme disappointment at least now when i bought the dvd set i knew it was finite and limited so i cherished each episode that much more firefly is the most imaginative television show ever broadcast it was intelligent fun funnny touching and poignant the ensemble cast had to be the best fit with each other ive ever seen and the writing oh the writing any episode would have worthy of a full length motion picture and better than of the motion pictures out there i watched the series on disk at a rate of one per day until the third disk then i stopped and went at it on per week to extend the experience until the inevitable end the series is difficult to classify is it a sc fi western as others have described maybe but that simple description seems inadequate to understanding firefly in all its nuances i think it is a celebration of freedom more than anything all human desires distilled into a form that is at once entertaining and profound i am not sure of foxs motivation for even producing it to begin with since if it fulfilled its promise it would have had to been exactly what the network claimed it was and the reaosn for cancelling it to begin with they said it was too deep or two complex for the average viewer well boys that had to be obvious before putting the first scene to film had that been the case the show would have never been authorized to begin with so we have a mystery no matter its limit is also what makes it more valuable enjoy each episode knowing it will end and it will make each one that much sweeter bravo to the cast the crew and to joss whedon for chasing a dream and bringing it to life tv doesnt get any better than this 
this was an excellent sci fi series its unfortunate that it was not given the chance to continue serenity proved that this was an excellent concept get both and you cant go wrong 
this ranks as a great sci fi futuristic fantasy series there is a strong ensemble cast and a strong plot premise firefly is set years in the future in this future it is more like the wild wild west than the jetsons illnesses like diabetes are present and cat gut surgery are used to treat injury any future in depth space exploration would be for resources and colonization it also shows the prevailing earth power in the future would be authoritarian with the chinese prevalent in the alliance they have the prime worlds as shown in the episode ariel and in flashbacks to rivers childhood these worlds are what you may see in star trek or pre occupation caprica on bsg the outer worlds have a lower standard of living this does make sense in the th century north america and south america were dependent on shipments from the old world readthe winthrop woman a novelthe winthrop woman by anya seton just as a comparison if you like more emphasis on technology this may not be the show for you this show is character driven some reviewers fault the science for being dodgy but this is true of all of the sci fi series this show is also short on idealism as exhibited in shows like star trek or star wars all of the episodes have something to recommend them the series raises interesting questions about the reavers and river tamm the movie serenityserenity widescreen edition is recommended as a follow up for that in summary firefly the series is an excellent ensemble drama in the tradition of star trek and star wars liking one doesnt mean that you have to dislike the others 
firefly is one of the best tv series of the past years if only for how well it gelled as a product within what is normally considered half of a north american tv season and the chemistry between the cast members this show was the initial proof that nathan fillion could be a charismatic leading that abc has bet on for the last years with the hit dramedy castle along with being a major stepping stone for getting its various leads more face time to show off their acting talents if you like westerns watch it love space operas gotta watch it if pondering the meanings identity heroism family freedom and the nature of authority is your thing this series is made for you 
this show and its cast writers and crew deserve far more credit for this series and the film that came after it than was given them the show was fresh and innovative and yet bore a humble and lasting character reminiscent of old world values devoid in many of todays shows these were characters refusing to live within the reign of a brilliant yet repressive technocracy they did all the things you might expect such outlaws to do but with an underlying moral code that stood them out as unsung heroes rather than rag tag hustlers i am disappointed that no sequel appears to be in the works but i for one applaud nathan fillion mal gina torres zo alan tudyk wash morena baccarin inara adam baldwin jayne jewel staite kaylee sean maher simon summer glau river ron glass shephard book and joss whedon writer director for making a wonderful show that our entire family still watches we have bought the movie and the series and they hold a special place in our collection while we are on the subject allow me to offer a bit of viewer praise for several aspects that i thought stood out in both the series and the film nathan fillions performance as mal served as an enigma to me from the beginning he was capable of making the hard choices to keep the ship and its primary crew safe even when the options were all unsavory that quick and brutal hatchet of leadership made me wonder at first why anyone would serve with such a man that was because i did not trust him but as the series moved further along we viewers began to see the world through his eyes we sampled in small doses the poison of this vile space empire and started to ask ourselves how anyone could not see the galaxy through mals perspective mal was such a strong character because his human frailty threatened to overwhelm him at any moment he forced down that weakness and demanded better of himself all the while with a wry humor that made him truly endearing and nathan fillion played him im not sure theres a better compliment for an actor out there adam baldwins jayne is a refreshing distance from his usual upstanding hard nosed straight laced military officer type roles even his portrayal of commander casey on nbcs chuck is no where near as lively and heart felt as the rude untrustworthy and conniving jayne he is the living personification of the term mercenary and yet adam never lets any of his former roles slip in jayne is always just one step away from total corruption jayne would have made the perfect nemesis for mal except for two things opportunity and wit joss whedon sir this was a thoughtful hybrid genre that i never found overpowering there was enough tech to keep ones feet firmly planted on the deck of the serenity and enough gun slinging and damsel rescuing to keep its spirit of adventure alive there was so much more to do with this show so many avenues to explore that this show could have gone almost anywhere and been great the writing was thoughtful the dialogue well chosen and yet entirely believable this cast was endearing and their work inspiring you could feel that they loved working together and that translated into a great show i really enjoyed the show if i had a billion dollars i would not only invest in serenity but i would back it once again excellent show 
one of my favorite tv series was stargate sg so i admit i was a bit reluctant to try another science fiction series however upon recommendation by a friend i decided what the heck i purchased the complete series on blu ray it started a bit slowly and was completely unlike any other sci fi adventure i had previously enjoyed incidentally i have been a fan of this genre for probably years or more after the first couple of episodes i was absolutely hooked and could hardly stop watching as many other reviewers have said i did not even know about firefly until several years after its demise but i totally agree that fox made a terrible decision to pull the plug well before it should have this series is a must watch for any serious fan of science fiction i just wish it would play on my blu ray equipped laptop but windvd complains that it is only playable on a region a or b drive else i would be watching it at this moment over miles from home arggh not to worry i can wait till i get home 
after reading here arguably the best ratings ever for a tv series i decided to get a copy myself im a huge star trek fan mainly for its futuristic view of humanity once we are able to achieve efficient space travel of course the myriad collection of starships and techno babbles are fun as well the founder visionary of star trek gene roddenberry sold star trek to network as western in space while the humor and style of original crew was like typical western tvs in the s i find firefly a much truer wild wild west its nice seeing through the eyes of people fight for survival deep in space in alien communities rather than from the eyes of starfleet crew im still bigger fan of star trek but im glad i bought firefly and thoroughly enjoyed it too bad its canceled some obvious mysteries on the characters to be unfolded later that never did and never will e g is the reverend a high level official of the alliance undercover there were enough hints along the way 
the lead editorial review of the firefly boxed set does a good job of telling you why you ought to own a copy of this collection but in reality it could use far fewer words to get the point across for anyone who knows the work of the folks involved with making the show joss whedon tim minear ben edlund etc then really thats all you need to point out this is another stellar series created by a group of people whose collective output has been critically very well received for those people who dont know the creators involved well the first question that comes to mind is quot where have you been living quot but perhaps a more relevant question is quot what are you waiting for quot firefly is a show that crosses all kinds of genre boundaries to create a show that is extraordinarily fun to watch even if watching it is a little depressing at times since it was really never given a chance on fox so get this boxed set watch it enjoy it and get your browncoats ready to see serenity on the big screen in the near future thanks joss and company for creating another classic bright spot on network tv 
i just watched the first three episodes a few days ago and was hooked a show written so well with such excellent actors should be on the air if any should 
buy this you will love it guaranteed in fact buy two because you will need a converter set to loan to people to convert them to become firefly fans it is that good buy the movie too serenity because once you get through the shows and i promise it wont take more than a week because you cant watch just one episode you will want more from the first moment of the real first episode not the mangled fox schedule that had them show the pilot last i have been hooked i just cannot get enough of this show and sadly there is not enough of it to even come close who was the moron at fox that canceled this show sci fi channel usa tnt is anybody out there firefly is one of the best shows to be created in this millenium easily the seinfled of sci fi i cannot believe that it was canceled before it even got a chance to build an audience i guess the execs at nbc are much smarter than their fox counterparts brilliant writing beautifully scored and the tightest ensemble cast since jerry george elaine and kramer were left sitting in jail is there a network brave enough to stop pandering to the empty headed reality craze and actually produce something worth watching 
i think the show is even better watching it the second time around on dvd the unaired episodes were brilliant i especially loved the return of saffron in quot trash quot through each of the episodes one of us watching would stop at some point and bemoan quot i cant believe they cancelled this show quot well worth the money to own this bit of tv history 
firefly was an incredible show i never got a chance to see it when it was actually on television but being a fan of joss whedons other creations i had to give it a try and i must say that i was blown away i was expecting something like buffy the vampire slayer or angel and thought i would have been disappointed if it werent like them i was wrong it is nothing like buffy or angel and i was not disappointed im under the impression that joss whedon can do no wrong when he is in charge there are several things that make this show absolutely fabulous the characters there arent too many shows that have character development that could surpass firefly the characters work off of each other and you find yourself relating to them the actors and actresses who portray them are perfect the writing joss whedon tim minear and an array of other wonderful writers have compiled some of the best scripts in television there are several episodes that are brilliantly written the story is incredible and has so much room to grow the acting the actors and actresses in this show both regulars and guest stars give memorable performances there isnt a poor performance in the entire series all in all firefly is an amazing show that would have been a ton of fun to follow for years unfortunately television executives dont always see eye to eye with viewers who knows if the movie is a huge success perhaps another network will try and pick it back up i sure hope so if you watch this chances are you will too 
i remember seeing ads for firefly and not being that interested in the concept even though i am a fan of buffy and love sci fi i recently purchased this dvd set out of curiousity it is a terrific series that was canceled too soon it is at least as good as lost i discovered lost after buying the season dvd too what makes both lost and firefly great is the attention to character development great pains are taken to make the characters as real as possible i really cannot understand why fox didnt give it a chance it has much broader appeal than buffy it could have had huge ratings if fox had given it more attention 
this show was fantastic i dont understand why it wasnt continued a tiny consolation is the movie serenity which wraps up the tv series and demonstrates that the firefly universe was as broad and deep and rich as any other series and we missed out because for some incomprehendible reason the networks cancelled the show it had all the promise of buffy but with wider appeal adventure humour thriller mystery romance and horror set in the future with all the grit and grim of todays world brilliant acting fun characters with depth and credibility stimulating story lines evocative sets and a horribly catchy introduction tune 
someone did an astonishing job in transferring these shows to dvd they are anamorphic and look gorgeous blown up with a front projector not hd of course but as close as any dvd ive seen even nicer that each episode really does feel like a movie as others have noted if hbo et al spent a million making rome couldnt they help finance another few episodes of firefly it would come with a committed audience already in place 
rarely do you find a series that has such great chemistry amongst the actors this one has it great dialogue humor timing story an all around great series not to mention the movie that came out as well you will enjoy this one 
anyone who enjoyed the serenity movie will actually enjoy the firefly series by josh whedon to an even greater extent a must for scifi fans 
doesnt it seem odd that a show that failed would be put on dvd i thought so too but i kept hearing good things about firefly and i am big fans of joss whedons other shows buffy the vampire slayer and angel so i decided to see what it was like i couldnt be happier that i did because firefly is definitely a great show that was killed before it could even begin to reach its full potential the show tells the story of nine people on the firefly class ship serenity which was named for a battle in a war for independence this battle was for the most part the last stand for capt malcolm reynolds nathan fillion and his fellow independents after this fight victory seemed imminent for the alliance a government who wanted to unite all planets under one rule mal and his friend and later first mate zo gina torres wanted each planet to rule itself after the war the pair bought serenity and assembled a crew consisting of wash alan tudyk the pilot and zos future husband kaylee the beautiful jewel staite the cheerful mechanic who definitely has elements of the buffy character willow the also beautiful alyson hannigan and jayne adam baldwin who is kind of muscle for hire they also have inara moreena baccarin who is a companion which is the new term for prostitute apparently years from now prostitution will not only be legal but it will be a respectful career she rents one of serenitys two shuttles and her presence is mutally beneficial to the crew and herself her clientele is increased and she opens some doors for mal and the crew in fact her nickname is the ambassador the group will do anything to keep going they will pick up passengers and do any job legal or illegal mal actually seems to prefer the illegal jobs just because it means thwarting the alliance then in the first episode strangely it was the one of the last ones aired three new people join the crew there is shepard book ron glass the preacher and conscious of the ship dr simon tam and his insanely intelligent and intelligently insane yes i know that didnt make much sense sister simon and river are on the run from the alliance river who is a genius was sent to an academy run by the blue sun corporation which is heavily funded by the alliance however the acadamy turned out to be a lab facility where researchers did experiments on river she sent coded messages to simon and he had her cryogenically frozen and then resuced her now mal and the crew have to deal with a crazy young girl who is a wanted fugitive the writing and acting on the show are definitely worthy of joss whedons name in fact after firefly ended nathan fillion and gina torres were cast in buffy and angel i loved this cast especially jewel staite she was priceless i was so afraid that she was going to die in the first episode and i was very relieved when she wasnt however her situation allowed for one of the best scenes in the entire series the thing that happened when mal told simon that she was dead was so funny some of my favorite episodes include serenity pts and the train job shindig ariel our mrs reynolds trash the message war stories and objects in space oh and speaking of characters in joss whedons shows did you see that in serenity carlos jaccot who played dobson also appeared as villains in buffy and angel although in angel he wasnt really evil despite the fact that he was a demon who wanted to eat doyles glenn quinn brains unfortunately we may never know how much some of these characters will be developed in fact there are so many things that we may never know such as books origins something was up with him he could shoot too well and the bounty hunter who may have been a little crazy said without any doubt that he was no shepard we also may never know what those blue handed men from the blue sun actually did to river and what they wanted her for the simon kaylee and mal inara relationships will never be fulfilled revealed destroyed and we wont find out if inara actually leaves i really hope that the firefly movie gets made so that we can see what happens next i would also like fox to revive the show the way that they are reviving family guy because they lost a true gem when they cancelled firefly updateas of august th i have shown firefly to four people who like me had never seen it before all of them are now big fans who are angry that the show was cancelled and are waiting for april for the movie 
i dont know how i missed seeing firefly when it aired on tv but i definitely didnt miss it when it hit dvd im a huge gina torres fan cleopatra and im starting to like this young whippersnapper joss whedon too though im a huge fan of high tech sci fi and visuals this show seemed to tone it back a bit its a good thing the story is fantastic cant wait to see the movie serenity 
of course this is a fabulous show no doubts there but i have had a lot of problems getting my hands on a complete set of dvds i bought two copies one at best buy and one at fye the first set was completely missing disk the case was there but when i opened it up to watch it no disk the second set had two disk s after returning them to the respective stores ive ordered it online and am hoping that i will eventually get to see disk i have never had a problem purchasing a dvd set before and its now happened to me twice so im posting to warn others to be sure and check to make sure all their dvds are accounted for very strange 
when i heard that josh whedon was coming out with a space sci fi show i got really excited when i heard it described as quot wagontrain in space quot i got worried once i show the first show i was hooked stop and ask yourself why quot star wars quot was a hit then ask yourself why the prequels stink this show has fully developed characters and they are interesting you want to know more about them you fall in love with some you hate some but you will have an emotional reaction to each and every one that is good writing the premise is cool even if the western theme gets a little corny at times still it works if this show had gotten a better timeslot better marketing and not cost as much per episode everyone would be reading about and watching the new run away hit quot firefly quot if you like quot old school quot sci fi and or space opera this is your show if you like a show with cool characters that suck you into the plot this is your show get it watch it and long for the firefly movie that is coming 
this is such a great underrated show i mean come on the show had enough people loving it to get a studio to make a movie about the characters after the show had been canceled for a few years i think i think anyone who likes buffy or angel will like this show even if they arent into the futuristic space ship stuff like i tend not to be but after one or two episodes youre hooked then a few discs later there are is no more the show dies off sadly so worth the money its just greatness sadly canceled greatness where youll live at least three characters if not all of them 
i bought this show on blu ray at the urging of a friend i didnt have high expectations but after the first episode serenity part and i was blown away this show combines a western feel and music with sci fi drama humor sex appeal and a unique originality that cements it as a very entertaining and enjoyable show every character has a story to tell along with the many ships races and planets i urge everyone who is a fan to call write or e mail creator writer joss wheadon to bring this show back in some form on any network perhaps the sci fi channel would be a perfect home if fox wouldnt take it back if not a revival of the show at least give the fans another movie the fact that the movie serenity was even made after the shows cancellation speaks volumes how many shows do you know of were given a movie after only aired episodes at the time of writing this firefly has been in amazons top bestsellers for over days its currently number under fox tv sci fi and fantasy tv and sci fi series too fox messed this show up when it originally aired by moving time slots airing episodes out of order and not giving it a good promotion thus not even giving the show a real chance may i remind you all that the show family guy was canceled by fox but the fans who bought the dvds loved it so much that they demanded its return and look what happened it worked the same can hold true for firefly if we all make the extra effort to show our support this is one of the best shows ive ever seen and it deserves a second chance to quote the opening theme you cant take the skies from me bring back firefly please 
theres so little thats good on television now that any halfway decent show stands out so its hard to be objective about a show like firefly however i am convinced that firefly is such a brilliant genre defining show it would shine in any era and that science fiction fans will still be watching and talking about this show in thirty or forty years as we do about the original star trek today when i first heard that joss whedon was doing a sci fi western i looked forward to it i thought thats great hes figured out that science fiction is the successor genre to the western both offer limitless possibilities for adventure and action its no coincidence that the popularity of westerns faded around the time movie science fiction started to become popular one genre looks back the other looks ahead but i hadnt guessed that whedon would put the two together quite literally one criticism the show gets is the unlikelihood of high and low technology existing together im sure whedon has read his robert heinlein tunnel in the sky farmer in the sky and low technology makes sense on a frontier world where theres not much money for power they dont use modern tractors for farming in many parts of the world even today they use horses and oxen firefly combines well thought out logically coherent world building with the adventure and sense of wonder offered by the best space opera the dialogue special effects acting and even the music is top notch the worst you can say about the series is that the plotting in some of the episodes is fairly pedestrian if you watch the extras you get the sense that the cast especially nathan fillion who clearly has a deep appreciation of what whedon is doing knew that it was part of something special the attention to detail is stunning several of the episodes are among the best television ive ever seen the last half hour of the pilot serenity just moves and out of gas and objects in space most of the episodes are worth seeing more than once heres hoping the upcoming serenity movie lives up the shows quality and becomes a success and that we get several more serenity movies and heres hoping that the money people in hollywood give joss whedon carte blanche to do what he wants in the future hes the rare talent who can transform genre fiction into art 
firefly could have been one of the greatest shows in television history alas well never know because the network killed it but we can see enough in this complete collection to see how great it could have been compelling characters make for compelling stories and joss whedon has always specialized in great characters watch it 
lets face it all you want to know about this you can get from websites or the description up there so im not gonna bother describing this is just to throw my stars into the pot how do you feel when you love something i love this series i actually checked its ranking in amazon com something ive never done before and was psyched to see it in the top sellers i want it to do well i want everyone to see it because i think theyll love it too this is as close to perfection as it gets for a show you have to pay attention to it you cant just put it in and ignore it its better written than anything on american tv today which is probably why it was canceled i dont hold out hope for a sequel but i do hold out hope for a movie 
what a great show never really saw this before i guess i have been working too much saw the movie serenity first dont do that get the complete series then watch the movie trust me thats the way to go this is so much fun too watch funny thrilling cheesy great the way the characters interact and come from all walks of life all the chicks are babes kind of a western in space i know i know but it really does work not looking forward to the series ending but i am looking forward to watching the movie again after i have seen the entire series youll love it it is a very cool show 
what other series in recent memory inspired this kind of passion and loyalty from viewers nothing can be said that hasnt already been said about the criminal loss of this show from the airwaves the dvd box set of the series and the movie serenity offer some closure for fans but maybe review number will be the one that tips fox over the edge and makes them order up some new episodes minus a few missing characters but we all know nathan fillian should be available again after that disastrous drive show on fox and playing a third fiddle on desperate housewives is no fitting end for mal bring it back hollywoodaholic confessions of a screenwriter
i didnt get into firefly until the show was off the air my introduction to it was the movie after being so enthralled by serenity i quickly picked up the series and am still shocked that this show was so short lived compared to the many others that survive on tv the writing was consistently great the cast had wonderful chemistry the effects were as fancy as they needed to be and not over the top a good mix of action comedy drama i would recommend this show to practically anybody not just fans of sci fi give it a shot by watching the pilot somewhere first and if you like it or even if youre on the fence get the whole series anyway its not that long or pricey 
if youve see the film serenity youll love the firefly series i somehow missed it when it was on tv and truly regret i couldnt have been one of many fans who must have screamed bloody murder when it was cancelled it is such a pleasure to watch so well written and the cast is perfect the whole idea of space being handled much like the new west was is so unique and the dialogue has such humor and is just how real people talk and relate toeach other all the episodes are great but i especially loved the captains run in with mrs reynolds including the rematch i have trouble rewatching them since my whole family lovesthem and is always borrowing them as i said at the beginning if you loved the movie youre gonnalove the series 
i had never watched even one minute of firefly or serenity the tv show or the movie until today i forced myself to watch this more out of curiosity or boredom im not sure which but mainly because amazon just added it to prime free streaming amazing show totally amazing now i see what all the hoopla was about that just paid for my prime membership cant wait to watch the rest of season 
best sci fi series great story excellent characters funny and exciting great special effects 
the handful of episodes on these dvds range from the merely enjoyable to the great but joss whedons firefly is somewhat frustrating as a complete series because he wasnt given time to complete it or even to put a satisfactory ending on the shows television incarnation mysteries abound after the final episode with the secrets of many of the characters frustratingly only hinted at at best that said the series is one of the strongest science fiction television series to date and marks a maturation of joss whedons craft many of the same archetypes from his buffyverse appear here but in more complex and satisfying form well worth seeing for any science fiction fan particularly those who prefer their starships a little more millennium falcon and a little less enterprise strongly recommended 
i might actually watch tv once in a while if there were more shows like this i saw the pilot episode of this on the sci fi channel and immediately went out and purchased the dvd now i understand why a dvd tv series that was released in is sitting up at on the top sellers list in the waning days of this is just really great acting writing directing music and everything its an accidental conglomeration of wildly different characters brought together by fate and bound by love hate honor and betrayal the interactions and frictions between the characters helps to drive each episode in new and unexpected directions through the meaty minute episodes and hour long pilot well worth the price of this set you will meet each of the central characters and grow quickly to know them many you will love some you will hate some you will hate to love and others you will love to well you get the idea many memorable lines and moments will grab you as you take in the entire series i personally had a hard time putting it down once i started i recommend beginning your viewing early on a saturday in case you get hooked like i did going to work the next day with only four episodes under my belt knowing there were so many more yet to see was near torture as soon as i finished watching i started them all over again i am not quite sure what fox was thinking or any network for that matter i guess there isnt much room on tv for witty writing heartwarming characters exciting action and clever plots since there isnt i guess we can say thank god for dvds and thank god for the internet so we can find out about gems like this that might have otherwise have been missed i know its weird but i actually think my life has been enriched for having seen that someone out there is making material with this much heart the entire series was some of the best guilt free entertainment i have had in years and my only problem with it is that there arent more episodes rent it first if youre not sure this is right for you but whatever you do give this series a chance this is not something i would have normally picked up on my own and i am so glad i stumbled across it thrilling adventures clever story lines witty dialogue and the best gorram tv show nobody ever saw although with dvd sales the way they are perhaps thats not exactly true anymore if you happen to like this and youre hungry for more check out serenity its a big damn movie that takes these same characters on a silver screen adventure hopefully not the last which takes place after the events in the series which only got made apparently because this dvd sold so well its a must have for any fans of this series 
this series is like a great book you just cant put down when my stanford son and duke daughter visited over christmas i showed them the series they resisted the idea of a space western but at the end of the pilot my son said that was good to which my daughter replied yes that was very good i realized i was enjoying it even more on the second viewing than on the first from then on it took real discipline to limit ourselves to two episodes a night till the series ran out someone always said one more even my wife who is foreign born and normally doesnt like american humor was gripped by this series wit as well as by its action starfly had everything imaginative concepts great cast and writing truly special camera work all in all brilliant anyone who loves westerns or likes sci fi do yourself a favor and watch the dvd then see the movie rlw
i never watched firefly when it was on tv i was too disappointed that fox had canceled dark angel if i wasnt already married jessica alba would be mine and vowed never to watch them again after all the hype of serenity i put the boxed set on my christmas wish list im glad i did firefly is one of the few sci fi series that stressed character over special effects joss whedon is a master of plot character and story the actors relate to each other like a family warts and all which makes the viewer feel comfortable all i can say is that fox shot themselves in the foot again if they got rid of the fox news channel they could support quality television with a return of firefly 
this show makes all the star treks stargates babylons and the like most of which im also a fan seem like dinner theater the look and feel is like you would expect if years had passed and things like dirt and wind and animals still existed not some sterile hospital like ceilingless spaceship sets or foam rocks on a soundstage with the standard purple alien sunset backdrop to the morons at fox first you allow yourselves to be a totally partisan therefore unreliable gop propaganda spewing machine and then you let one actually several of the most finely conceptualized and intelligently written television series slip through your fingers oops gop and intelligent in the same sentence kudos to universal for the upcoming feature film and thanks for uhd now to start those sci fi channel or better yet uhd reruns to usher in the movie this sept get the dvd set just in case im not sure universal owns the rights to the original series i believe fox distributed the dvd 
in an age where the viewing public is assaulted by unscripted tv shows from quot survivor quot to quot the bachelor quot its rare to see a show come along that aims for genuine entertainment that combines great acting and writing with a team of visual experts who are not afraid to explore techniques that offer the viewer a different perspective joss whedons quot firefly quot is such a show while the fans despise network executives for canceling the show i applaud the folks at fox though they did make some poor decisions afterward for taking a chance on it and giving us this dvd set its really really good stuff if you havent seen it and appreciate good fiction youre in for a treat and being such a great creation it is far from dead ill leave it to you to find out what bdm means now for the negative while i thoroughly enjoyed the series i have friends who didnt and found it boring simply because of the lack of action its a legitimate complaint if you dont enjoy characterization and want an unmemorable mind numbing viewing experience along the lines of say quot knight rider quot or quot bill and teds excellent adventure quot or if youre looking for something more realistic such as quot er quot or quot csi quot this isnt for you however if youre looking for something new and enjoy sci fi and in particularly westerns you likely will enjoy this feast only fourteen episodes but stay tuned theres more to come 
ive seen this series so many times it feels like i know it by heart still i bought blu ray for simple convenience of having everything in one spot and in high def short short desc of the show future a band of mercenaries flies around in a ship that has a glowing b tt thus firefly and does stuff for money not always nice stuff and thats your st clue that this series is different than usual good vs bad kind of stuff we get on regular tv characters are beautifully created with stories behind them that you can relate to well some of em story is always interesting and rarely you will look at the first few minutes and say i know how this is going to end main character is balancing between goody goody and neer do well personality somebody already did a great job by doing a review of the series so ill keep it short and sweet if you like unique and humorous stuff heres the best deal youre going to get anytime soon buy it d
id heard for three years how great a show firefly was but id never seen an episode until this week when i borrowed the dvd set from some friends of mine it was phenomenal and like too many shows on fox cancelled far too soon the show follows the crew of the serenity a group of transporters with no scruples about taking a less than level cargo if the pay is right and with a bone to pick with the alliance the official government theres a brother and sister on board both fugitives she from a top secret government academy that performed mysterious experiments on her he for rescuing her a shepherd preacher with some mysterious ties of his own an official companion do the euphemism yourself a spunky mechanic a tough as nails second in command married to the wisecracking pilot a dirty fingernailed grunt and of course a captain with a past to live down each character has strengths and weaknesses real personalities and real histories theyre what make the show work here i think is what hurt it it couldnt be classified a lot of people who saw it didnt know what they were really watching not a far flung space opera but a western in the sky these characters arent noble starfleet officers theyre gunslingers with a definite sense of right and wrong and no qualms about striking out against the wrong as they see it they carry firearms wear dirty dusty clothes and even ride horses when theyre planetside theres more than one episode where you could watch the first five minutes and think its a show set in the nevada territories in the s until they finish up whatever job theyre on and go back to their spaceship in short it was a great show but one that people couldnt pigeonhole and while the die hard fans love that sort of thing the public at large sadly doesnt the dvd set includes a few nice extras including a half hour long making of documentary a few other featurettes a gag reel and an audition tape a decent package considering what they had to work with but not enough ill be there opening weekend for serenity and i cant help but hope that somehow this show makes it back on the air 
amazing show a friend bought this set and i watched it for the first time the only negative thing i have to say about it is it was cancelled 
some would surely disagree with me as to the above assertion but i am dumbfounded as to how i missed this when it was on the air this is a surprisingly good show to which i was introduced only when the dvds came out i tried this show because of joss whedon as i was such a big fan of buffy and nathan fillion whom i enjoyed as caleb in buffy season i dont know how joss does it but his shows have a way of sticking with you his characters linger in my head long after they have disappeared from the screen firefly is a perfect example a show built around nine space travelers each of whom are dynamic fleshed out characters including the captain a registered companion legal form of prostitute who rents a shuttle a brother and sister who are fleeing the alliance a chaplain and a man who is a veritable mercenary and tempted by the financial possibilities of betraying the crew additionally joss has a way of creating an amazing backdrop for his stories in firefly there was the war for unification between the alliance and the independents a k a browncoats which leaves a world with central alliance loyal planets and outer reaches where the law does not extend home to all manner of people including the flesh eating reavers who might not be called people at all add to these things some great sets and special effects and a memorable bluegrass theme penned by joss himself and you have a wonderful show its a shame it only lasted one season 
i needed another copy since my son took mine when he moved outi let him get away with that because as i mentioned he moved out

absolutely undeniably one of the greatest shows that has ever aired on network television and my personal favorite dramatic television show ever its perhaps a bit daunting to both camps those who like sci fi and those who dont because although it looks sci fi flying space ships and what not thats really not what it is at its heart all of josh whedons shows have been about creating and finding family and focused strongly on character development and this series has both in spades whedon writes dialog with such effortless flair and he is a master of never letting the viewer get bored or comfortable the good always has a little bad mixed up in it and the really bad moments always seem to be hilighted with a bit of black humor one of the absolute funniest moments in the series occurs early in i believe the pilot when mal tells simon that kaylee is dead and shes not watch and see this is much how life is though its never simple and if you are bothered by such things then go back to watching your abc sitcoms the western elements that are often advertised come in in the form of the rim planets where conditions are poor and many people live in poverty hardly a episode passes where you dont see someone riding a horse but it all fits and feels very natural regardless of how advanced technology and society gets there will always be those on the outside of it the characters themselves are magnificently crafted none more so than mal the reluctant protagonist he fought against the alliance think star wars empire but with far less sinister overtones and lost and is now something of an outlaw and takes pirating jobs with his crew to scrape out an existence what serenity the name of his ship is to him is a sense of freedom and a family the absolute greatest moments in the series come when this is felt strongly when the crew is sitting around the table eating dinner together when they are on a backwater planet singing and dancing and drinking with the locals and mal ends up getting married the show is without peer in its ability to create a sense of camaraderie and truly of family in instilling the belief in you that no matter how big the galaxy may be as long as you have someone next to you its always managable the show is intriguing poignant hilarious if you dont laugh during jaynestown you might in fact be a robot and absolutely a must see watch the pilot immediately and welcome to the ranks of the browncoats very highly recommended
a western about pirates in space doesnt get much better then that this is a show for anyone who loves the work of joss whedon one of the best written and most creative television programs in many years it is a shame that it didnt make it past the first season but this set is a fine tribute to the show nathan fillian summer glau and adam baldwin played unforgettable characters that help to make this such a great show in addition the movie serenity is based on this show it is hard to believe that its been off he air for years but it still holds up as one of the finest scifi shows ever created 
boy fox sure has a bad history of cancelling good shows first dark angel got the axe after a second successful season and now firefly the heir apparent to buffy never got a chance to stretch its wings oh well at least whedons making a movie and until then the dvd will more than tide over rabid fans this thing is packed even going so far as to include the episodes that never made it to the air and this series just feels at home on dvd as it was aired in widescreen format it also features the best visual effects that have ever graced a television show and an ensemble cast that in a few episodes accomplish what some casts never do in friends anyone the intriguing story of a ragtag group of outlaws in space makes for a compelling backdrop and all the episodes play off of the characters not just their struggles against the space mafia and the tyrannical alliance though these conflicts are certainly well done each character grows somehow over the course of the all to short series and in addition to the story there are some great action pieces as well the extras on the set are great there are a number of episode commentaries a behind the scenes look with interviews with the cast as well as interviews with crreator joss whedon topping off the bonuses are original script drafts and some picture galleries all solid stuff for collectors and casual fans alike all in all if you missed the show pick this up as its a fun ride and will introduce you to the characters before they fly to the big screen next year if youve seen the show well i dont need to tell you that this set is well worth the money 
how many star reviews have i given bloody few id never heard of this show then one day i got a package from amazon that a girlfriend had sent with the firefly series inside she loved it and was just sure i would too you know what she was right i had to fight to limit myself to one show a night it was that good from show i found myself amazed beyond understanding over a number of points like why hadnt i heard of this show before how can a tv show be so damned good why on earth did fox cancel it will they really do the movie or is this just wistful thinking on the part of the fans i have no answers for you here it begins with a song and a guitar almost western sound and very very good the voice the song both are perfect for the show you see the ship and the sets and you have to be amazed at the quality there is no down side here unless you count the untimely demise of a great show the american history reminders are unmistakable its at the end of a terrible civil war the captain and his first mate zoe were on the losing side now the whole verse is trying to rebuild and do the best they can there is an old west feel with a new frontier the bad guys are scary and the good guys have heart there are no aliens the actors are exceptional i fell in love with the zoe wash relationship i liked captain mal reynolds all three characters are beautifully played one of my favorite shows is the one where how everyone came aboard jayne cobb the mercenary was particularly good two things are certain here firefly is worth every star i put up there and more when there is a movie made i will see it on the big screen then i will own it asap 
firefly was a one season wonder that should have been given much longer to establish an audience in a continuing series about a tramp freighter in space we got humor and adventure in one package nathan fillion has proved in both firefly and castle that he can carry a series and the rest of the crew made an interesting mix of characters played by fine actors who have solid performances elsewhere its great to have a blu ray set to show off this series at its best on your tv and the price is right for a complete season on blu ray highly recommended 
i recently saw all of these episodes and i had never before seen any of joss whedons other tv series this show is a very interesting reimagination of the science fiction genre mixing sci fi western and even military ideas in one the most important thing in this show to me is characterization the characters on this show are very very good in addition to this the show is funny touching gripping and probably the most fun i have had watching a tv show in a very long time this is very highly recommended 
after watching a show like firefly its harder to watch a show like the current star trek franchise its harder because the flaws are so much more notiable visually star trek is great but the writing is as dated as an ego driven shatner monologue firefly is great not because of its niffty effects or it cool western sci fi genre its great because the writings great the characters are familiar yet fresh the plots are simple yet intriguing we feel for this crew of outcasts as they take their beat up cargo ship from one port to another theyre small time criminals just trying to get a little more than what they have the dvd does a few things that the fox tv airings did not it shows the episodes in order which is amazingly important to this series which incorporates a broader story arc over its brief run of shows it also includes several unaired epidoes which are wonderful fun but dont give us all the answears to the questions fans crave of the series the good news is that a movie of firefly is scheduled for theatrical release sometime in luckly for us this dvd series is here now for us to enjoy and savor until the movie hits the big screen 
i missed this series completely when it was on fox i remember seeing the advertisements for it and thinking it looked good but for some reason i never found it before it was canceled i forgot completely about it until about a year ago i saw the dvds on amazon and bought them part on a whim and part from the great reviews it has what can i say that hasnt already been said this series is awesome if this was on tv now there would still be something on worth watching if you are a sci fi fan you will enjoy this short lived and well made series this series has my highest recommendation 
fox made a huge mistake when cancelling this show it had such potential and easily could have been the next big show on tv it was fun it was funny it was creative an amazing show that truly did deserve more than what fox gave it im certainly among those that think it should be brought back one of my fav tv shows ever 
shes still upset that fox cancelled it me too but im more used to idiocy in high places but now we have the dvd set and its gorgeous you have not seen firefly until you have seen it in widescreen and real sound on a large screen in my case plasma hd tv the images are sharp the effects hold up very well and the cast is as quirky as ever heck the pilot episode alone is probably better than of all sf films ever released and as my wife says no commercials firefly was intelligent witty a bit goofy character driven and a lot of fun also had one of the best theme songs of any show of recent memory so of course the network executives moved it around forced the episodes to be shown out of order then cancelled it abruptly imagine if those same executives had been running fox when the x files started a decade ago all wed have would be a vhs set of a dozen or so episodes of scully and mulder bozos all i can hope is that joss whedon succeeds in bringing firefly to the big screen and then back to the small one bruce 
i just finished watching the whole series and now i get why there are over reviews and why almost all of them give this series five stars as i did this is tremendous television great writing great ensemble cast judicious use of special effects and morena baccarin is so beautiful it almost hurts to look at her i cant even imagine what the suits at fox were thinking when they cancelled this outstanding show thank goodness the cast was re united for a feature film which is also excellent 
while firefly has some spectacular cgi renders it doesnt get lost in special affects or techno babble dialogue instead the technology is but one piece of the storylines backdrop the concept is simple earth was used up and with only two superpowers left the usa and china cultures merged on some level as humanity left for the stars some planets were started with precious little funding after the terraforming was completed so those planets tended towards being agrarian with a spartan use of technology picture a good western with a high tech spacecraft landing behind the gunfighter or a high tech communications device sitting in a corner opposite a wood burning stove anyways at some point in time the wealthier more industrialized planets decided it was time they were all united under one central government the more independent planets protested and fought back despite an impressive fight the browncoats from the poorer planets lost the series is set in a kind of post american civil war frontier west theme theres th century looking individuals with revolvers m s shotguns and once a laser pistol the themes discussed and presented put any star trek to shame as it focuses on the individual over the government for fans of robert heinlen and his themes of individual rights and freedom firefly is for you if you prefer the big bird of the galaxys droppings consisting of a socialism utopia you probably wont like it if youre a babylon fan youll probably love the show 
what a sad thing that this excellent program wasnt allowed to continue there is nothing currently running on television that can compare to the creative interesting memorable stories of the firefly crew great ensemble cast fantastic plots imaginative in every way you cant say enough good things about this dvd set joss whedon is a bit taken with himself during the commentaries but with his talent you can cut him some slack ill be wearing out these discs love it recommend 
i never heard of firefly until i saw it on an amazon recommendation then awhile later i read some reviews of farscape another show that id never seen or heard of then i got tem confused and ordered firefly i was not disappointed ive watched of the episodes and i can confidently say that if this show were currently in production id make a point to watch it the writing casting and acting are all top notch despite what you might think the western theme works well its certainly one of the more original things to appear on tv and if you liked babylon and or deep space you should like this and if you didnt like them you still ought to give it a look 
i watched the st episode and wasnt sure if i liked it enough to see the rest watched the second one and fell in love with the series it is hard to believe that this was cancelled after season i even bought the movie but was not impressed with it as compared to season on t v 
what is so incredible about this sort lived series episodes in all is that it accomplishes more with half a season than most shows develop in six seasons the characters and performers playing them are all top notch the stories in each episode are extremely funny profound deeply moving and exciting from beginning to end if you love sci fi youll love this but even if you dont thats okay because despite this taking place in space and on other planets the emphasis is on characters emotion and a feeling of family truly one of the great television series of our time the dvd comes with fun commentaries a revealing retrospective documentary and a few other fun featurettes plus with the movie serenity coming out today i feel this could very well be the beginning of a wonderful new series regardless of format 
i still cant believe that not only did fox cancel this show but they actually seemed like they wanted to kill it they banished this show to the friday evening basement changed its timeslot three times presented the episodes out of order and didnt even air the pilot which introduces all of the great characters this show is far above anything weve seen in science fiction tv or regular dramatic tv for that matter in decades you dont have to be a fan of science fiction fantasy or westerns to love this show its rare to care about characters in science fiction and fantasy tv shows because theres a certain level of believability that has to be suspended but this show has such a great attractive cast of real humans without the usual hackneyed alien makeup who speak dialogue so crisp and funny and who work so well together that you are captivated by them from the start i could go on and on about the terrific special effects and the compelling storylines but all i can really say is get this box set dvd or a movie theater screen is the presentation this fine show deserved from the start 
in truth after watching the very first episode of this bizarre set up western themed sci fi you will be stunned speachless even at how great this series was by the time i got to the rd disk i was enraged at how stupid the network was that let this go trust me if you have never seen firefly even if you arent a sci fi fan both of which qualify me to write this you will love this show every episode was like a mini movie and the characters were beyond description the stories are as well written as novels and the special effects were better than anything you see on tv today but without a doubt its the characters whereas most tv shows put cliche characters in pounded to death situations these guys played these roles as if they were the first ever to pull it off the rouge pilot on the run the cute girl mechanic the out for himself soldier all these cliches are done just perfectly you will watch these all too short episodes over and over and over again its worth twice the asking price and youd still love to pay for it once you traveled aboard the firefly 
the great thing about this show was its more realistic view of the human nature the story arcs are intriguing and the characters themselves are unique when ive watched sci fi or read sci fi the characters were always the same the brave dashing captain that would sacrifice everything he she believes in for the greater good with the exception of battlestar galactica this show stands alone exploring what anyone would do when oppression and their way of life is ultimately changed for the worse its a great show and i would implore anyone that is a true sci fi fan to watch all the episodes 
i only caught a few episodes when this show first aired there seems to be a pattern here i liked the show so of course it was cancelled in favor ofthe endless reality brainless crap that bombards the airwaves these days sigh the short and skinny is this show was astoundingly good in humor story acting and fx trust me this show was on the money dont watch this expecting star trek or the usual sf shows out there firefly has its own unique voice and look and this is a large reason why the show was so special the only people who dont like firefly seem to be the narrow minded retarded drones that tune in regularly to idol and the rest no offense to you retards out there the story of firefly flows along throughout the series bits and pieces are picked up and explained in different episodes there is rarely a quick cut and dry answer to the problems the crew faces which gives the show a more real grounded feeling than the usual episode problem minutes of fx bad dialogue cardboard characters resolution move to next episode we are used to i could go on and on but the bottom line is this show is worth your time and money buy it today enjoy and then go see the movie version coming out in september 
you want to curse fox for canceling the show for its a steal buy it cause everyone says so they mean it for real this show belongs on top star reviews hows that for some news firefly is not hard scifi like star trek you wont perplexat all the jive and geek speak on warp drives no mr whedon in this short lived season through wonderful visuals keeps on pleasin relationships while in non utopian style keep unfolding and leave you holdingthe remote in hand so lets give props to the man josh whedon 
firefly was hands down the single best tv show of this decade thus far the movie version serenity was good but the tv show is much better hopefully the rumors of a new season of firefly being produced for distribution on dvd turn out to be true firefly displayed great humor well written dialog and there was excellent chemistry among the crew the scenes around the dinner table were truly wonderful firefly was conceived as a space western it does invoke the concept of space as the final frontier as well as the original star trek and firefly was far superior to any of the latter star trek series firefly is a great science fiction show full of that sense of wonder for which that you read watch sf in the first place 
along with many others i discovered this show as it was being cancelled one of the biggest mistakes ever made in television if you ever see a list of shows that were cancelled way too early this show is either at or near the top joss whedon the writers directors producers and of course the cast came together brilliantly to bring firefly to the screen this is one of those kismet moments in television intense action combined with well written stories and dialogue grab the viewer by the adrenal glands the funny bone and the heart as different as the world of firefly is it retains enough of the link to our world that you can really relate and come to care about the characters buy this series plain and simple it is a piece of television history that you want to have in your collection 
if you dont enjoy this series then odds are you are not a sci fi fan it has great characters great story lines complex relationships cool visuals the only negative is that they canceled it way too soon i would highly recommend watching the series and the follow up movie serenity 
before buying the blu ray set of this series i had read some negative reviews on amazon as well as some positive ones id never seen the show before picking up this set although my brother owns the dvds comparing the two the blu ray set is greatly improved over the standard definition set detail is generally real high with a lot of appropriate and natural film grain the series was shot on mm film so id expect it to have a filmic appearance in this regard it does not disappoint cgi effects shots dont look as good as i suspect due to the age of the show that they were done in a much lower resolution and then upscaled for hd they dont look great but they dont hamper the enjoyment either the only way to make them look any better would be to redo them and i doubt fox cares enough to put money toward such an endeavor if you have the dvd set but like hi def detail and film like quality id say its worth the upgrade it definitely wont disappoint the show itself im only four episodes in but im enjoying it immensely i dig westerns and i dig sci fi or rather i should say i dig alternative sci fi what the hell that means im not entirely sure but ill take a show like farscape over a staple like star trek any day 
firefly is a geat show st the characters actors are awesome each actor has had or currently owns a major role in a television movie nathon fillion is the main character he is currently on the show castle kalee jewel staite was also on the show stargate atlantis for a awhile also lets not forget joss whedon himself if you liked the new avengers movie then you should like this show for they are both his work my point is the cast is strong so the comments on bad writing and acting is unfounded as for the western aspect of the movie well in the show they didnt just come out and say it but there is a good reason why it has a western feel to it with a touch of chinese heritage lastly after this show was cancelled unjustly this show had a huge fan base so much so that joss whedon felt he had grounds to finish the series in a full length feature film and he did the full length film finishing the firefly series is called serenity and currently holds a star rating here on amazon out of reviews and was rated a on imdb out of people let me explain the western aspect and the chinese influence to this show for those people who might find merrit in this argument joss whedon doesnt just come out and say it in this show he wants the viewer to watch and come to their own understanding of why modern society in firely has a chinese and old western style to it most of freflys fans understand it but for those who dont let me explain nerd moment beware in this show earth is no more or if there are people still on it its a loooong ways away the alliance is the major power in firefly from what i understand the allaince is comprised of what were the remnants of the earths western powers united states great britain and china when they settled on their new worlds they formed an alliance this is why you see and hear people in firefly wearing chinese clothing and speaking chinese while still using english as their base language inara who plays the companion is a great example of this and is almost always wearing a gown that has a chinese or oriental style to it lastly the western feel to the story joss whedon actually explained this in the show better then the chinese part alot better you just have to pay attention in the pilot episode they clearly state that after the alliance terraforms a world they throw settlers on them with almost no resources and a few small herds and minor supplies this is why the show has a western feel to it the inner alliance core worlds are the metropolitan mega cities you might be expecting in a sci fi show which appear later in the series while the outer rim worlds have the desolate wild west aspect that is the story plot for the western feel to the story however i suspect budget played into this part aswell almost every tv show out there costs several million dollars just to air one episode so the production costs of creating a futuristic city in every episode or space battles and what not probably would be to costly from a producers stand point the movie serenity makes up for the lack of production restraints in firefly and spares no expense when it comes to cgi effects and scenery 
i saw one show half way during its fist season and i was hooked it is one of those rare shows that is different yet makes sense and flows well it is like star trek meets the old west the writing is brilliant and the actors fit their parts perfect picture the future where society has crumbled such that survival returns to bare basics food trade and fight to survive it is a shame that fox did not put it on prime time and give it a chance 
this series was entirely too short lived one of the best series i have had the enjoyment of watching and my only regret is that there are so few to watch 
bought on the reviews of others and not only was i enchanted but the whole family chimed in it was only then that i discovered that my sister had already discovered firefly and was a devotee wish shed told me earlier 
anyone whos already looking at this knows its an amazing series that ended too quickly theres nothing more i can say than that its a great series and they did a great job packaging a shipping it 
this television series called firefly is simply outstanding and i was so sad when i heard of its cancellation firefly is a science fiction show about a group of rogues that travel aboard a firefly class spaceship named serenity the universe in firefly combines past present and future technologies there are small towns that looked like they belonged in the western frontier youll even see old fashioned revolver pistols and rifles being used for combat then there are the many colonized planets and spaceships and laser weapons used by the elite the crew of the serenity ship consists of several strange characters two war veterens a pastor doctor mercenary prostitute ship pilot mechanic and a young girl with mental problems they all are unique in their own way but they become like a family and watch out for each others back the crew runs into theives assassins government agents gangsters police renegades military soldiers and more the characters face lots of dangers but they stick together and have a hell of an adventure i loved every single character in the serenity crew and it made me fantasize that i could join them the characters and dialog in the stories are so intelligent and witty there were so many times the show just had me laughing out loud and feeling sad during tragic events and just enthralled by the excellent stories from each episode the television industry and the general public will realize one day that its greatest loss in entertainment history is a show called firefly the fox network executives ought to be kicking themselves for cancelling this fantastic show the extras in the dvd are excellent as well containing optional spanish dub and subtitles cast and crew commentaries the making of firefly tour of set walkthrough with series creator joss whedon the master gag reel and deleted scenes if you enjoy science fiction the movie serenity intelligent shows cowboy bebop or just excellent stories in general do yourself a favor and watch this series 
im glad i decided to give this show a chance fellow fans of other sci fi shows i watch all told me i should check out firefly it really was an enjoyable if brief ride this show really is a western in space which is basically what star trek was originally called in order to sell it to a network who would have thought you could put people on a spaceship as well as give them cowboy hats and horses and still have it work out so well at the heart of this show is some fantastic drama and a wonderful cast of characters even with only episodes each of the series regulars comes forward as a memorable character with a unique personality by the time this show was cancelled they had barely scratched the surface yet already there was enough substance to hold a loyal following of diehard fans who eventually were able to convince the studio to bring the franchise back for a movie firefly is a milestone in television history it is not to be missed 
never mind their network was built on the backs of shows like the x files fox is all about reality television really now joe millionaire is reality hokey action shows like plus some t a shows like the also cancelled birds of prey and fastlane and not quality television joss whedon famous for his clever writing on shows like buffy angel and several movies was the creative force behind firefly this was to be a different type of sci fi show he presented us with a realistic view of our possible future a contrasting viewpoint from the overly optimistic star trek series if it looked like a western it was because terraforming other planets would be a lot like the pioneering days of the old west joss presented us with a future time without particle weapons transporters and without alien races if you think about it then youll see the logic in that aliens are still rumor and even if they do exist they seem to hide themselves from us in some sense can you blame them particle weapons would take an unlikely leap in technology and expense and government policy changes to be handed over to the layman for his personal use transporters well its just not set that far in the future the fox executives suits basically seem to believe we are all morons they thought the pilot was much too complex to be understood for us feeble minded morons so it became the last episode broadcast instead of the first hopefully they will put these in the correct order on the dvds and not in their broadcast order the pilot had the firefly which refers to the cargo ship they fly landing on a large city like settlement it reminded me of the sets of blade runner the combination of old versus new technology was quite striking and very well done like blade runner you had a mixed blend of races with a prominent oriental presence missing since it was a settlement on a different planet or moon was the non stop darkness it wasnt totally polluted as yet and relentless rain that characterized the blade runner movie the pilot had a good combination of plot character development and action to help you relate to the story the episode fox chose to show instead of the pilot was weak by comparison the sci fi channel does not seem to recognize a good thing when they see it and passed on picking this up when fox dropped it instead they spend good money developing proven past turkeys like battlestar galactica give me a break the cast on this show was very diverse but seemed to work well together they had the right blend of fellowship conflict tension and personal agendas to keep it interesting there was a slowly unfolding mystery in the unknown origin of some of the passengers some members of the crew were loyal to the highest bidder and others crew kept their agendas hidden for reasons all their own joss the shows creator generally has a master plan for each one of his seasons his stories build to a big payoff in the end and he does not practice cliffhangers im sorry this one did not get a chance to play out he does say hell try and resurrect it one day i still wish fox could have completed one full season at least their decision to cancel this and replace it with a relocated freshman series had a further effect on their programming fastlane the replacement in the friday early time slot probably cost them the higher rated show that followed john doe i believe this because it makes too much sense that the sci fi audience would be more likely to stay around and watch john doe than fans of fastlane in the end fox lost all three shows nathan fillian plays the captain of this group and seems to be your classic hero type on the surface you forget sometimes hes really a smuggler he is tough without being a rambo and a lot smarter than he lets himself appear he has a few trusted crew and some perhaps not so trustworthy but otherwise very useful in a fight the firefly crew would probably be doing honest work if it would pay the bills instead a little smuggling and some outright theft is the way they make ends meet i believe the questionable ethics explored here would have made for lots of interesting episodes had the show continued the crew of the firefly is not totally bad or good but perhaps better than most the captains cynical nature and probably his criminal ambitions is forged in a past time which is detailed at the beginning of the pilot diversity is nice in the members of the crew they have a tough girl a cute techie type and a worldly type actually a socially acceptable high class space prostitute with some political connections plus one of the passengers is a mysterious girl with perhaps unknown mental powers the male crew is made up of a pilot a tough guy and among the male passengers a preacher and a doctor who is brother to the mysterious girl passenger as i mentioned before some episodes after the pilot are a little weak probably they will play better after knowing the story from the pilot after that the episodes will get progressively stronger the production values on this show are excellent as are the special fx visuals the ship design is interesting and it makes for some cool special fx graphics especially in the pilot the price of the dvd set is pretty good considering the many hours of entertainment you get for it if fox includes the unaired episodes you could hardly find a better bargain i cant comment on extras or sound yet since it hasnt been released 
this is probably the best sci fi show ever created each dvd is packed with great stories and adventure this show has prompted the creation of an up and coming full length motion picture from joss whedon called serenity i was lucky enough to attend a special hardcore fans only screening of this movie which will not be commercially released into theaters until september th the movie is a perfect ending to the tv show which was sadly cut short due to being in a bad time slot and foxs inability to air the episodes in order while the tv show is incredibly action packed the movie will not leave you dissappointed buy the dvds then make sure to see serenity september th 
a few years ago i stumbled onto a tv show called firefly i was drawn in and fell in love with it then one day it was gone poof just like that i never heard why or heard others talk about it i felt like i was the only person that had ever seen it fast forward two or three years and there is a commercial for this movie called serenity hey that looks like the same cast from that tv show i saw so long ago i said well needless to say it was what a great story they weave very cleverly written with humor and just the right touch of sci fi and even a hint of romance im not a great writer so i wont bore you with the history of firefly as im sure another reviewer has done it so much better than i ever could really im only here to lend support for such a great story and cast i just bought the dvd for serenity today and was blown away now that i know they have the whole series on dvd im about to purchase it im so glad i found it again i had no idea it had turned into a following on the dvd they showed how big this following was and i was moved by it also was a little sad that i didnt know it existed so i could join in anyway i hope you enjoy it as much as i did and i hope even more that we havent heard the end of this great story 
anyone who has a love of science fiction and great character development will cherish this series there isnt one weak episode among the provided here and this shows cast must surely go down in history as one of the most finely tuned ensembles ever to grace the small screen each character bounces and resonates off another in widely differing ways the end result is a cacophony of dissonant perspectives that magically transform into a brilliant harmonic whole by the series end i want more 
this is the best sci fi series since babylon i cant believe that it would be cancelled after only season the only reason not to buy it is that you will be so disappointed that that is all there is 
i only got to see this show in because when it originally aired i thought i dont want to see any westerns but this show is more science fiction action drama comedy and actually everything you would want in good tv then true western i cant believe they arent making more episodes they should bring it back i saw the whole series in evenings because it was so good i didnt want to stop watching it does end in a strange place so many questions unanswered and relationships just begining to develop but now theres a movie so we can find out more about river and hopefully some more characters hook up the movie hasnt come out here yet so i dont know they really should make more of this show it is truly great story telling and imagination 
i can never understand why quot firefly quot was cancelled but then i can never understand why my country dont even air this cool sci fi series at all but buying this complete series was a risk and this risk was worth it the theme was unexpected although done before in some other occasional forgettable movies for a tv series quirky theme song and yet it has win me over watching each episode it has everything that is like in perfect order story humor interesting crew action and wit with only episodes and i just realized by turning the back of the box that it mention episodes were never air in u s and the nd episode was the opening episode of quot firefly quot i really wish fox shouldnt cancel the series but now finally its in my hands with all the episodes and the extras i can watch it in my country that never even air it in the first place if you love something different in science fiction genre this is the one for you im not a buffy or angel fan but whedon had made me a fan for quot firefly quot 
its a shame that the fox network cancelled this series at what would have been the halfway point of its first season given that however it is wonderful that the production end of fox entertainment gave the show a second life on dvd these episodes are incredibly creative and if they had been given a chance both in scheduling and longevity i think the asian western techno antiquarian fusion thing really would have caught on and wed be eating southwestern eggrolls at chilis oh wait the cast initially appears to be the standard stereotypical mix of characters fighters mechanics doctor etc and a typical pc mix of white and black characters after viewing the show a few times you realize that these are individuals the amazon warrior woman is the geeky pilots devoted wife the psycho fighter has a penchant for unfortunate headgear choices the doctor far from playing god has no personality at all the man of god has a mysterious past okay the prostitute with a heart of gold is clich eacute but she also has unexpected depth and ethnicity is never an issue no one is ever referred to by race nor is the mixed race marriage ever mentioned and everyone swears in chinese like the characters the stories are also complex rarely do they go the way you expect them to and they frequently have two or three plot twists along the way the dialogue is top notch with very little technospeak to complicate things if the ship breaks down its due to a carburetor or a compressor or something else where you have idea what it is sure there are occasional plot holes but for the most part things make sense from the perspective of the main characters as disappointing as it is to not know what happens next to the crew of serenity there are a couple villains niska and saffron who reprised their roles during the abbreviated season series who will also be missed i said it before and ill say it again shame on fox for canceling this show and for other networks not picking it up hopefully sales of this dvd set and the upcoming feature film will rekindle interest the dvds themselves are nicely packaged in slimline cases and include a nice set of extras the commentaries are good as are the documentaries hearing ron glass belly laugh was unexpected given the characters he played in this show and on barney miller i was surprised by the swearing in the gag reel mainly because i would have expected it to be in chinese seeing the episodes in whedons intended order is also a plus the original airdates are also noted so you can scratch your head and wonder what was fox thinking the menus tend to lag on my stand alone dvd player but run much smoother on my computer if youre a sci fi fan youll like this show if youre a western fan youll like this show if you want to learn to express yourself colorfully in chinese youll love this show take firefly out for a test drive you ought to like it if not please dont tell the mechanic its luh suh she wont be happy 
this show rocks i didnt watch while it was on the air and i am really sorry because it deserves to have ratings and to stay on the air i have one episode left to watch and then a long dry spell until the movie next year someone pick this back up and put it back on the air 
i am ashamed to admit i am one of the ones that did not lock on to firefly while it was being aired but viewing this amazing series on dvd not only makes me wish i had been an original viewer but that fox had the vision to see what it had and gave it more time to find an audience a tremendous cast all around though with extra kudos to nathan fillion mal morena baccarin the ambassador and yes adam baldwin jayne perhaps adams best role to date this show is a reminder of how science fiction in its purest form is still about people and relationships i e startrek toc and when writers and producers focus on this everyone benefits if youre a fan of sci fi or fantasy give this dvd boxed set a try and be sure to go see the original motion picture serenity due later this year 
the picture is perfect the sound is excellent the extras great and the show is incredible i think the critics need to rethink if theyve omitted this dvd set off their list i got it at christmas and it was my first introduction to the show and was amazed best present i got even if i did give it to myself 
i just watched the series and film again over the holidays if mash which ranked only th its first year had the same network nabobs unwilling to allow that series to find its fan base it too would have been canceled staggering yes that is what fox did to this brilliant series that fans all over the world love and remain heartsick about to this day not only is it developed by josh whedon for petes sake but also it has such talented actors and crew that the thing is about as perfect as a series could be it is often laugh out loud hilarious other times pulse pounding thrilling and sometimes heartbreaking but always fascinating check it on imdb and where it has nearly perfect ratings as here in amazon also take a look at the casts filmographies all of the brilliant actors have been busy since the show was canceled all of them in series movies right now including nathan fillions charming castle i am so happy for all of them yet from everything ive read they too wish they had been able to continue firefly whedon planned it for years and are deeply touched by their fans love of firefly dont miss the film serenity which whedon did for his fans who worked so hard for the series it is also excellent and helps tie a few ends but its not enough no canceling fiefly may very well be the worst blunder in television history 
back in firefly was the promising new sci fi show on fox cursed with such a horrible string of bad executive decisions its a miracle how it managed to gain a dedicated following the network insisted on various changes to the show they aired episodes in a different order than its creators intended they even cropped the picture to a aspect ratio for tv although it was meant to be shown in widescreen no wonder it eventually got canceled halfway through the season with three more episodes made but never aired all this ive only learned recently as with came the release of serenity the motion picture which has lead a whole new bunch of us to discover this interesting world having seen the movie i was aching for more as luck would have it this time there actually was more this very dvd set firefly the complete series im happy to say that it has exceeded my expectations in every way on its own the untimely cancellation of the show make firefly hard to recommend without any reservations couple it with serenity however and they make a thoroughly excellent package together with firefly you get more minutes of the same great cast of characters and many more of their interesting adventures although each understandably somewhat less grandiose than that of the movie even the bonus features are impeccable of the episodes exactly half of them got a commentary track each with a different set of people four of the cast are featured at least one once nathan fillion alan tudyk jewel staite and morena baccarin and of course joss whedon the brains behind the project is along in three of them to share his thoughts beyond that theres a gag reel deleted scenes behind the scenes features and more really the fact that this was released on th century fox home entertainment the same studio which so mistreated the show on tv is no cause for concern this dvd set does firefly justice and treats it with the respect it always deserved the bottom line is youll want to pick up both this and the serenity dvd that the two are unlikely to ever get officially bundled together is only because they were produced by different studios 
when i watch this series i am always astonished at the amount of action humor be it good natured and jovial sardonic or dark and good feelings packed into each minute episode it is truly incredible each character brings something truly special to the serenity team all nine of them and you are amazed when you finally count them up and realize that wow there are nine different fleshed out characters on this set and you know and love all of them and while they all have very distinct personalities they all mesh together to form with the risk of sounding clich eacute one big amazing family their fluid mix of chinese mandarin and english is truly impressive expletives are muttered yelled screamed and whispered in mandarin but not so that you dont have a very good idea of what it is theyre saying this complements the english very well and is a far superior tool than watered down words like darn or god forbid bleeps two mysteries remain by the end of the season though book the shepherd and river the little sister of simon the doctor of course the captain mal is a bit of a mystery himself as is his touch and go relationship with inara the companion but this is perhaps less of a dying curiosity than it is an interest if that makes sense then there is jayne with his yes his perpetual struggle with morals and greed you come to love his crude on the mark humor and realize he is far more intelligent than he might first appear you find yourself forgiving his short fallings and rooting for him to do better by the crew and by himself and ive never used the word rooting in any sentence either spoken or written before in my life so that should tell you something you can really see the darkness is still very much a part of mal not an evil but a darkness which has become part of his life ever since the war ever since he watched thousands of his men die in battle and of starvation but this only shows when times are uneasy unpleasant uncertain perhaps the most lovable and this is a very tough choice to make believe you me ones idea of who takes this crown will probably switch from episode to episode is kaylee the adorable always cheerful brilliant mechanic on board serenity she never fails to see the bright side of things as simon aptly puts it kaylee is a real marvel however you cant not fall in love with river and feel her sorrow and pain when you see what has been done to her she has some truly inspired lines like when talking to jayne after simon has just given him a lengthy diatribe also i can destroy you with my brain she seems to have it out for jayne to be honest though she probably doesnt always know what shes doing as she rightly puts jayne is a girls name you are immediately gripped pulled into and riveted by the show as soon as you sit down and watch the beginning of the first episode 
joss whedon is brilliant all the way i love buffy the vampire slayer and angel and i have all of the dvds i got the movie serenity and i liked it after a couple of viewings when i got the whole season of firefly for christmas i was excited since watching episode one i couldnt stop watching i saw the whole series in days while trying to expand the experience i fell in love with the characters and i love the music and the theme song blew me away i love that song its one of the best theme song i ever heard its too bad that it was short i wanted more and more im happy they made the movie as it does rock and it makes more sense after watching the series dont see the movie first watch the series first and then the movie i love this show one of my favorite show ever its about a group of law breakers stealing and doing anything for money and hopping through the galaxy finding anything to make money they would do odd dangerous jobs trying to stay alive this show doesnt hold back and it sometimes has brutal honesty that is refreshing for a good price get it it will be a great bumpy ride for you 
firefly was a quirky and absolutely terrific show i never understood why it was on fox and not the sci fi channel fox screwed the show from day one looking forward to the movie in september 
i was so mad when fox canceled this show it was starting to get really good i cant wait to see if they do a movie with it like some people say they are it left a lot of question to be answered and iam hoping they will be in the movie
joss whedon does it again the man is a genius from alien to buffy the vampire slayer joss whedon does not dissapoint and firefly is no exception a quirky blend between space opera and old western firefly is a journey that involves much more emotions and a lot less technology than most sci fi space adventures with humor and relationships this show is a must for anyone who has enjoyed star trek farscape or buffy the vampire slayer this show goes above and beyond my expectations
i will not repeat what other awesome reviewers have said just like to say that i bought the series after seeing the movie serenity and i have never been so hooked on anything in my life the depth of character and quality of writing is spectacular and theres not one character whos exactly hard on the eyes g heres to joss the god bring it back 
for the past four years i have been living outside the us so i missed the first run on fox the scifi channel was the reason for buying cable when i returned a few months ago the serenity movie looked great so i bought it and was amazed yesterday i bought the series collection and spent the day and most of the night watching nearly all of it firefly presents a future that i would like to live in ragged around the edges but with virtue great characters brilliant pictures and a theme that borrows a bit from my favorite cowboy bebop well worth the price lets hope that there is a follow up to serenity 
this was a short lived but well written and acted series that i enjoyed as much as farscape the characters are believable displaying their flaws as well as their strengths the stories are a nice twist of genres that gives a new take on the space theme the only negative is that it is only episodes when i would have liked about or more they do kind of make up for it with the movie serenity also highly recommended which is a nice conclusion to the story your time and money will be well spent on this series 
this show has a little something for everybody sci fi fans western fans comedy fans action fans one thing is certain above all else though it will make everyone who watches it a nathan fillion fan not that theres a poorly cast member on the crew adam baldwin steals the scene on multiple occasions and jewel staite as kaylee the cute and sometimes naive wrench jockey be still my heart as for the blu rays themselves they look and sound great and unlike how fox network chose to originally air them the episodes are properly ordered on the discs so you can watch the the story unfold as was intended if youve never seen this show do yourself a favor and buy this set if youre already a fan of nathan fillion in abcs castle you may be even more pleasantly surprised after watching firefly as there are several tongue in cheek references to firefly in episodes of castle that only fans of both shows will pick up on 
im one of those who saw the movie serenity got curious about the television show then watched each of the tv episodes this show was obviously genre bending combining sci fi with a western feel which is probably why it was cancelled it couldnt be pidgeon holed by or for a network executive but its uniqueness you might even say its quirkiness is part of its charm another thing that might have contributed to its demise was its inability to maintain a consistent tone sometimes the sensuality and violence are way down low at family hour levels even unrealistically low whereas other episodes were strictly adults only fare ironically however the two most extreme episodes were after the show was already cancelled the second to last show hearts of gold about rescuing the whorehouse baby was over the top in its sexuality the last never aired episode objects in space where the bounty hunter boards the ship had a level of menace and violence absent in other episodes even the episode where mal and wash are tortured unpredictability is always risky in a tv show where people tune in every week to get same sort of entertainment this show was unpredictable from the start which again was part of its charm 
 firefly was one of those rare tv shows that made people think as well as care its heroes are outlaws living on the outskirts of an oppressive interstellar society joss whedons gut devotion to liberty shines through in this show and its messsage is clear freedom matters its worth fighting for and when you cant fight you escape the oppressor if you can some episodes are better than others the ones scripted by whedon tend to be the best but the series overall is better than almost everything on tv today maybe if the movie serenity opening next week as i write this is a hit the show will be given a new lease on life i hope so 
a show set in space with impromptu family crew cowboy in space feeling and wonderful dialog just like when family guy was cancelled fox made another awful decision by taking this show off the air it is a must have on disc 
i remember seeing the ads for this innovative program when it was first being aired and thinking it was something i wanted to watch however due to work committments i missed the first couple episodes and never found it again then i heard it was cancelled after a half season well soon reports of a fan following of this program developed similar to star trek and when i saw the complete series on dvd i decided to buy it boy am i glad i did firefly unfortunately came out during the reality tv craze it is a fine program with excellent characters and stories a wonderful premise superb acting and cast fine effects and a great production team watching the hour pilot on dvd and the shows in order certainly built the characters and the plot apparently fox when originally airing this didnt air the episodes in the order that made sense losing a fair number of viewers along the way this program is one of the best sci fi series ever aired unfortunately it died too soon but like the phoenix it is rising from the ashes and i am eagerly anticipating the feature movie serenity in the fall one thousand plus reviews cant be wrong if you enjoy good stories action humor and a little science fiction delve into firefly you may be pleasantly surprised 
this is probably one of the best sci fi series that i have seen in a long time it blends the sci fi background with a western feel very unique and very good i highly recogmend it to anyone who loves sci fi 
nearly everyone i work with has been raving about this tv show since it came out on dvd i personally thought it seemed kind of hokey loooking and since i didnt recognize even a single actor except for adam baldwin animal mother from full metal jacket i thought it must just be one of those cult movies that only a few people really like and i must work with them i was completely wrong this tv show has everything that every other show tries to have great well rounded characters great acting better special effects than many hollywood movies great storylines and writing great dialogue that is also quite risque they basically take things about as far as you can in this country anyway if you get the time watch this series well worth it 
do you like star wars indiana jones well here is a great series that is the perfect blend of science fiction and the wild west i had no idea that i would like this sooooo much i had never heard of the tv series firefly but after seeing the movie serenity i bought the firefly series dvd as well i am hooked enjoyed the humor and witty banter excellent characters 
this was a wonderful show with intriguing storylines and rich characters it has moments of drama intrigue action romance and lots of fun the fact that josh whedon and the fans were able to convince the studios to shell out millions of dollars to make the movie after the show was cancelled is a testament to the show itself be sure to watch the entire season then watch the movie serenity 
im not really into scifi type entertainment other than bsg but like joshua said in his review once i gave a couple episodes a chance i was instantly hooked and the cast grew on me give this show a chance and it will grow on you too trust me trust us 
 firefly is quite simply the best series ever cancelled i think fox was expecting buffy in space and cancelled it when they realized it was something entirely different they should have at least waited long enough to find out that it was awesome nathan fillion summer glau morena baccarin heck pretty much the whole cast theyre all faces you know and love now they all shined in this show and this isnt just some sci fi cult following sort of show i mentioned it to my year old mother who enjoys nathan fillion in castle that he was in this show too she saw that it was coming on some channel as a marathon and decided to watch one of them she sat down at noon to watch the pilot and had to set her dvr to keep recording the end of the marathon at the next morning because she couldnt stay awake any longer and couldnt stand the thought of missing any of them so far i own it and ive given it as gifts to my mother and brother 
that i had started watching firefly earlier i dont think ill be able to seriously ever understand why this seriously superb and engaging show ever got cancelled there is so much going with it in the episodes that were aired im pretty sure it had to do with tv ratings and such it was a mistake though im only glad that i was able to have the opportunity to check out and enjoy a show that kept me coming back with its great characters engaging dialogue and some all around quality action having watched this whole series i can say without a doubt firefly will go down as one of my top favorite tv series for some time to come the collection is high quality and has a few extras packed in as well its a decent price for a collection that is worth so much give firefly a try and when your done you will see what others like me already know that sadly quality shows get cancelled well before their time but this one will continue on for some time to come 
i am a big fan of buffy angel so my sister got me this dvd because the creator of buffy joss whedom also came up with this series at first glance it seems like a sci fi which isnt really my type of tv show but i am glad that i got this dvd this is not your typical space sci fi futuristic show firefly is set in the future but unlike other space shows it has a different feel space is actually quiet and soundless the future seems to be dominated by chinese there are high tech weapons lasers and hovercrafts but also guns horses and a western feel to some of the episodes this is a view of the future that is quite different from most space shows more grittier more real more of a struggle to survive the strength of the show comes from the characters and their interactions with each other they just happen to be on a space ship i should have known that any show by joss whedom would be one of relationships diaglogue and struggle firefly tells the tale of a rag tag bunch of outcasts who are on a ship serenity they are lead by their captain malcolm and his first mate zoe both would be familiar to fans as caleb from buffys last season and darlas child from angel i forget her name joining them are walsh zoes husband a doctor and his sister kaylee the mechanic and jayne a kind of mercenary also on board is a preacher and inara a companion prostitute together this group flies around doing odd jobs some legal some not they are avoiding the alliance a quasi govenment bad guy some strange blue handed men and reavers sort of space pirates murderers as well as their own enemies like all of jws shows the human element and relationships are ones that any viewer will be drawn to the struggle between walsh and zoes marriage walsh cant believe that he has married such a beatiful and strong woman when he is the opposite the deep respect and trust between zoe and malcolm the budding romance between kaylee and the doctor inara and malcolms tension and attraction and all of them has to intereact and deal with river the disturbed sister of the doctor who was rescued from the alliance and is being pursued by them this dvd set contains episodes as well as the usual dvd extras including the making of firefly joss whedoms comments a gag reel deleted scenes etc it is interesting to watch and imagine where this series was headed before it got cancelled but jw himself hints that there may be another reincarnation of firefly another series a film also there is a hidden easter egg jayne singing the folk song about him on the last disc so if you are a fan of good drama intriguing characters and witty diaglogue get this dvd i dont know how it got cancelled bad timeslot lack of advertising but it wasnt because the show wasnt compelling fascinating and different 
i was loaned the series back during the summer it sat waiting on the floor finally at the urging of my fiance we sat down to watch it more to be able to get it back to our friend that out of a desire to really watch it honestly this show took most of the first disc to draw me into the series i watched the first few episodes with a lot of unanswered questions much of which were huh wha and how did all getting no answers i needed backstory it took a good way into the second disc to start making connections about what was really going on and how the whole series worked however once i finally got into the characters i got into the entire storyline i needed something from them to make be want to see what they were doing next in some cases it was a story arc in others a few quick and simple catchy lines did the trick finally now i wish i had about more episodes to continue a lot of unanswered questions and stories that this series left hanging i know the movie is out there but i think a true finish to the season would be needed to give a solid ending or better way to continue the story of this verse 
i first learned about this show from two good friends of mine they mentioned it but i didnt pay much attention really then the movie came out and i still didnt make the connection until i spoke to them again i went online and read the reviews i have never seen this many star reviews for anything i realized that i must be missing out on something great so i purchased both the series and the movie simultaneously i also started to record the series on tv and watched them too one episode is all it took everything everyone is saying is true i am a rocket scientist and just the fact that there is no sound in space was enough for me anyone that would have taken the time to think about something like that and the nerve to make a show without sound in space like it is supposed to be had my never ending respect ive seen all of the episodes finished them last night but havent seen the movie best money on a series i have ever spent when are they going to realize this show needs to be brough back we all seem to understand it when will they 
this series is a wonderful sci fi series it is too bad that during its initial run that it was cancelled way through its st season only the true browncoat followers know how great this series is if only the network would have given the series a chance and put it in a much better viewing slot the would have seen how great of a series this could have been to them but they lost their chance this series is terrific i enjoy viewing it over and over and over again its addictive in a good way get the series and give it a chance if you like star wars and star trek its kinda a mix of these plus a whole lot more 
i picked up all episodes of firefly after having seen serenity in the cinema like the film the tv series firefly is a truly great piece of sci fi funny wry touching poignant frightening and scary are all adjectives that apply to firefly it is also an example of the genre making serious social comment for example the struggles of the individuals who crew the firefly class freighter serenity against the politically correct and interfering alliance government an entity that appears to be colluding with or even in hock to mega corporations now i wonder just where the parody could be there sadly this boldness probably contributed to the shows early demise though set years in the future amidst strong undertones of the old west mankind has colonised planets and moons beyond the earth a recent war between the separatists and the alliance government has ended with total victory for the latter despite being peaceful and benign on the outside the alliance is completely ruthless in going about its aims and tends to step on anyone who gets in its way eking out an existence among the outer rim planets is captain mal reynolds and his crew of largely former separatists nathan fillion makes for a wry and sarcastic mal reynolds even if the character does nod towards han solo at times among his crew are simon a young doctor and his sister river who is a volatile psychic both are being hunted by the alliance on board the firefly class freighter serenity this crew smuggle various cargo and take passengers on a no questions asked basis like the film the tv series casts the characters as real people and this makes them so identifiable and likeable when they have their rough moments the viewers tends to find themselves caring about them and their fate apart from the alliance the crew of the serenity have to contend with hordes of reavers these are horribly mutated space cannibals who raid and pillage with the intention of capturing people so as to eat them alive the main reason for cancelling the show so early into its initial run would be appear to be an attack of gutlessness at fox where a company which is normally very pro government simply did not want a show that advanced the individual and cast the government into the role of aggressor villain the series did not pull in significant viewing figures but other shows have run with less viewers for an entire season and have then been allowed to build so why not this particular series a suggestion for the poor figures is a boycott by enraged buffy and angel fans who were trying to make a point to joss whedon for cancelling both of their favourite series at this time another suggestion for the poor figures though is just how much promotional effort did fox actually put into the show i still believe though that the decision to cancel by fox was probably driven by internal politicking combined with the already mentioned unhappiness with a tv series that portrayed government in the role of the villain it is a shame because if serenity had been allowed to build then it could have gone on to be as big as either buffy or angel this is a puzzle though because fox has continually supported the simpsons which has never been afraid of political satire universal now own the rights to the big screen versions and apparently two more are planned after serenity i for one certainly look forward to seeing them maybe fox would consider selling on the tv rights to someone else who would be prepared to make a go of it anyway do see firefly and serenity for yourself if you have yet to do so and be entranced by the unique charm character and riveting plots that the tv series and film have to offer i believe that you will seldom find a more rewarding viewing experience 
i remember hearing about this show and seeing few advertisments when it was first broadcasted on fox i perked my interest but i missed the shows due to having to work and such and then it disappeared from existence never to be heard from again until now a fellow cashier bought it and told me it was awesome and since i like some science fiction shows i thought maybe i should and i did this is one of the best scifi shows ever created what it is is a science fiction western in space there are no alien races or anything its just human who teraformed various planets to inhabit themselves and they colonized out there ie the wild west in space its really creative and has some very interesting characters like the captain who has personal issues his first woman who always follows orders her husband whos a wimpy funny guy and the very attractive quot space hooker quot theres others and things get really complicated when they pick up a doctor and his sister who are wanted by the alliance the typical corrupt govt power if you like science fiction westerns and some comedy you need to get this lets hope the movie quot serenity quot does excellent and is able to revive this show or maybe the sci fi channel will pick it up after all they made stargate sg one of the most famous scifi shows ever after fox dropped the ball they do that a lot it seems 
 burns half as long by that reasoning this show should not have lasted ten minutes joss whedon has created an incredibly believable world a surprisingly effective mixture of the old west with science fiction with an ensemble of character actors at its heart that shine as brightly as the cutting edge special effects surrounding them the writing in this show is exceptional the acting is superb all around even all the guest actors that show up give good performances the only gripe i may have had with the creation of the show is all the hand held cinematography but this show is a different animal they mix in the special effects shots with the same type of camera work as if some bystander is capturing all the effects as they happen which makes for an immediate feel to the scene special effects and all the idea is ingenious and the fact that the visual effects are all top notch and extremely expensive make this one of the most effective science fiction shows ever created if you love great science fiction with action humor excellent writing solid acting and a collection of some of the finest visual effects creatively rendered then look no further than firefly for a solid sci fi fix i will warn all newcomers however that this is all they made before the show was cancelled believe me with a show this well made the episodes burn up by like a brushfire on a windy day firefly is science fiction at its finest highly recommended 
why fox let firefly die is as much a tragedy as a mistake too bad for us yet thank god we have season and serenity and a new movie hopefully on the way for one i hope they wait for nathan fillion to fill mals shoes again watch it i dooverandoverandover 
i rarely watch anything more than once but a few shows have become staples in our household we think of them sort of as tv comfort food and return again and again for any number of reasons firefly is one of those shows all these years later the dialoge sticks in your head and you realize you sort of quote it and find certain phrases popping up in daily life for example see this this is the chain of command its the chain i take and beat you with or aim to misbehave and the always appropriate big damn heroes firefly fans did the impossible and forced the studios to give us a full length movie serenity and there are discussion groups and forums based on firefly all over the internet one season only and the ripples firefly created are as strong as those from the star trek universe additionally we watch this both on dvd and via amazon prime streaming using a sony box and the picture has always been crisp and clear love the ability to stream firefly instantly from anywhere 
i have a friend that has been trying to get me to watch this after watching a few episodes i understand just why he was always raving on about this series 
i started watching this last night and was blown away by the detail either i am color blind or close to because i discovered that light vivid colors have now made this series a great favorite i have watched the original several times and it didnt compare not movie quality of course but well well way worth it to me 
 this is the best sci fi show since tng and ds and the sad thing is its actually better than anything done with the star trek universe of which im a hardcore fan and i wouldve slapped someone had they said that to me but its true do not miss firefly if you love sci fi youll thank me 
i pretty much never watch television but i heard about this show by word of mouth and gave it a chance it completely blew me away it varies from being hysterically funny to tragic to downright terrifying the writing is incredible all the dialogue is fresh and smart ive watched a lot of sci fi shows and this is by far the best but beyond that its the best of any kind of show ive seen on television in terms of cast acting characters writing plot and pretty much anything else i can think of usually with shows i get focused on one particular character early on and dont care much about the rest but firefly has incredible character development every single regular character is a delight to watch and every single episode is superb that it just ends like that so prematurely is heartbreaking there arent any other shows of this caliber out there i hope so much that this show gets picked up again and is continued on from episode fourteen like there was never an interruption it was going soooo well how could it have been canceled 
so i read all the reviews i could to see whether or not the blu ray version was much better than the dvds up converted the reviews seemed to be half the reviews saying the blu ray images blew the dvd out of the water and the other half saying it didnt look any better i took the plunge sold the dvds to relatives and bought the blu ray discs i have now watched the first four episodes on disc and i can confidently say im not sure i was not really blown away by the difference in quality between the blu ray version and watching the dvds up converted on my blu ray player i believe there are places certain scenes maybe the outer space shots where the blu ray shines a bit more but i am not overwhelmed i am now wondering if the movie serenity will be different that will be next on my agenda i still give the review stars because this is an amazing fun show its premature cancellation was a tragedy 
some friends at work talked me into borrowing their copy of this series after several months i finally threw in the first dvd one night i was hooked immediately and watched the entire series over the next few days i cannot believe that this was cancelled excellent 
one facet of the show that was often misunderstood was the idea that this was merely a western in space a space cowboy show no what i saw was an extremely clever take on technology how some can afford it and some cannot look at our own world youll find some countries with high tech while other parts of the globe rely on much older technology that was the firefly vision were not one homogenous collective all living at the same state of technology we span a broad range spread out in space do you really think everyone could afford star trek style high tech 
over reviews and counting so here is my two cents soon to be lost in a sea of thousands of other pennies like many i never saw this short lived series when it first aired i never saw buffy the vampire slayer nor angel nor have i watched the current dollhouse joss whedon who is he then again i dont watch any tv series on a regular basis because i dont make an effort to know what day or what time they are on if a tv program comes on i may watch it if it interests me otherwise i move on to something else or pop in a movie i also missed the entire year run of bsg but bought that series just recently so how did i come to see this series well it started when i rented the movie serenity on a lark and the film surprising me a western in space sure why not it makes perfect sense to me and i liked the movie outland which was high noon in space and while i like good science fiction and a good western i usually dont see both in one movie plus the heroes i use the word loosely in this film are an odd mix of pirates thieves a man of god and even a prostitute but all have some sort of code of ethics well all except for the character jayne did i feel serenity was a great movie nope but it was sure a heck of a lot of fun and had some really witty writing i ended up purchasing the dvd simply because i felt it was a movie i could enjoy repeat viewings so what happened my son mentioned firefly and lent me the series turns out that is the worse thing that could have happened why because i slowly began to get very involved with the series and its characters this wasnt immediate it took me several episodes of course i bought the dvd set that was a no brainer but im a bit bummed once i watched the entire series i knew there would be no more episodes no more firefly no more serenity no more witty dialog popping up at the most unexpected times and places at least i now know who joss whedon is this series is now classified at cult status like the original star trek when it was cancelled after the third season perhaps its status came about because its life was cut so short it didnt run for even one full season and one can thank fox for this blunder there wasnt enough time to muck it up but enough time to get one hooked there were also many questions that need to be fleshed out the river character especially but also shepherd book as well as the shadowy agency in the alliance two by two hands of blue is it really a star series no probably not the acting varies from being a bit stiff at times to very good but the cast really grows on you as you watch i mean how can one not like the slow witted and out for yourself jayne or the soldier woman zoe or mal or you get the idea but lets face it not every episode is a gem but even the worst ones were entertaining my favorite episode and i have several is out of gas i rarely have belly laughs when watching a western or science fiction although the new star trek movie was just as witty so ill just call firefly refreshing with its wide variety of very different characters some with mysterious or murky backgrounds packed on a run down boat in space so yes firefly is worth a out of or a star rating in my book and from the reviews i see here i guess im not alone when i felt twinges of sadness and wanting to see more and because it wont happen i consider that realization a bummer 
what more can we say about fox network execs and their stupidity i have a theory that sometimes it is best for a show to burn out bright before it gets stale as with futurama but firefly was never even given the chance to hit its maximum illumination running the second episode first instead of the awesome hour premier stupid dropping the viewers right into the middle of the world without even knowing the characters stupid recomendation buy the set and watch all excellent epidodes in the order intended this show takes star trek tech smashed it with the used look of star wars original trilogy and throws in the wild west for good measure in the middle of all this we meet a band of charming and intricate characters that joss was able to have us care about in the very first episode on the dvd the cast is excellent all the way around the wild west theme seems strange at first but grows on you very quickly it kind of makes sense too sure we have space faring tech but we just terra formed this planet to colonize and dumped people on it so yeah they live in shacks and ride horses and use whats available sure it might be a desert its probably hard to terra form a dead planet to green earth specs it would take time for a planet to be changed in that way technological aspects aside the show is just awesome the characters and dialog shine and you just end up loving them by the third epidose youre laughing along with their in jokes and care about their lives not many a show can pull this off serenity has the best captain around you might say hes a bad nice guy like others try to be in other shows but never have i seen it pulled off so well you just know that malcom reynolds will try everything he can for a peaceful resolution but if he has to kill you he wont mind the concept of america and china forming the basis of the planetary alliance is also original its cool that when the characters get upset or curse the lapse into chinese think of the alliance as the federation from star trek and the browncoats or border planets as rebels who hate those tight pants bureaucrates meddling and you get the idea i could go on forever and it seems just amazing that all this was presented in only episodes just watch them then curse fox in chinese 
the scripts of this series were wonderfully written and the acting was incredible joss whedon should be thanked for such an amazingly well done series its just a shame even a sin that something this good can be limited to only one season i just wish fox net had more vision to allow a master to do his work uninterrupted so thanks joss for your brilliance 
firefly is an odd duck its a kind of science fiction western it borrows conventions and language and settings from both genres but this is one duck that soars as we get to know the ensemble cast they start to become welcome visitors into our home and the wacky universe in which they live with characters swearing in mandarin chinese starts to make a strange kind of sense theres action and adventure galore but the writing is also extremely funny plus if you enjoy the tv series with all too few episodes then youll love the movie serenity that continues and to some extent concludes some of the plotlines in the tv series if you havent seen this series or the movie yet youre in for a treat 
not enough of this show not enough time to realize the show was even there and definitely not enough advertising to let anyone know it existed what is wrong with the powers that be they will advertise a crappy show to death but a good show gets canceled before it gets noticed thats just wrong firefly and the follow up movie serenity are amazing it keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to know whats next who is the blue sun corporation what is the whole story with shepherd who was he before what happened to make him don a collar how much can river really do whats gonna happen with mal inara will jayne find a woman who becomes part of the crew will simon kaylee have kids the possibilities are endless except for the idiots that be who thought it was a smart thing to do when they canceled it the deaths of wash shepherd can be worked around i mean look at dallas or for that matter it could have been a story that anyone of the characters could have been telling someone it could all be worked out anyway my ramblings aside it is a fantastic show that needs another chance now i am so glad i rented the dvd serenity or i would never have gone searching for answers and then found firefly i love this show 
for a not so famous show the production value is great ended before its time 
 firefly is exactly the kind of science fiction series that youd expect joss whedon to make a sort of reverse star trek with a wild untidy cast of characters and its not hard to see why it developed such a fanatical fanbase even though it lasted a measly fourteen episodes magnificent writing if your hand touches metal i swear by my pretty floral bonnet i will end you well developed characters and a somewhat more realistic approach to a sci fi western its a shame that the series never got to unfold to its full potential it takes place about five centuries from now far from earth that was many planets are ruled by the alliance an authoritative military corporate government that forces various planets into a unified force which some planets are not terribly crazy about and in the black of interstellar space there are cannibalistic savage reavers the story takes place on the spaceship firefly whose crew mostly make a living out of smuggling and or carrying cargo theyre a motley bunch including the captain mal and first mate zoe who are war veterans nathan fillion and gina torres courtesan like companion inara morena baccarin goofy pilot wash alan tudyk a menacing mercenary jayne adam baldwin mysterious priest book ron glass fugitive doctor simon tam sean maher and his possibly insane sister river summer glau this odd band of people roams through various worlds which have a sort of wild west by way of space opera atmosphere they must deal with crimelords the reavers duels kidnappings a devious woman who claims to be married to mal jaynes folk legend status and the alliance itself who have a mysterious and sinister interest in the tam siblings as much as i love some star trek series specifically the original and deep space nine they rarely show people who fall outside the federation and its rather smug authoritarian approach firefly is the exact opposite their enemies are the domineering alliance of planets who think everyone should be like them and the firefly crew glory in living a life of freedom and unpredictable semi criminality in the firefly universe technology hasnt changed who and what people are people still grapple with the same ethical moral religious and political issues that we have now and always have had cruelty and kindness exist in the same measure and people still ultimately look out for themselves and nobody is perfect even their enemies have a shade of moral greyness and of course joss whedon brings his usual flair to the story butt kicking action scenes grotesque horror a hint of conspiracy and bucketloads of quotable dialogue yeah we should start dealing in those black market beagles that ranges from the roughnready wild west lingo to the hilarious baby geese goslings they were juggled the characters are a motley family of sorts they dont always agree or even necessarily like each other but they are mostly unified their colorful different jobs ritualized sex worker ex soldiers merc doctor priest allow them to have even more varied backstories all the actors do excellent jobs nathan fillion morena baccarin alan tudyk and sean maher all give particularly good performances the most exceptional is glaus river a damaged young woman who says mad things about cows and wears pretty floaty dresses firefly the complete series is a slice of rich witty sci fi that sadly had only a brief moment in the sun in a fairer world this would have gone on for years while tedious reality shows crashed and burned 
i had been hounded for a long time to check out this cancelled tv show and im glad i finally did its set in the future and combines quot space opera quot with a sort of quot western quot i know it sounds a little odd but it works so well its frightening im not going to ramble on about this show ill just say that ive never seen a tv show cast work so well together making characters that feel like extended family if you havent seen firefly buy it now otherwise you will be doing a disservice to yourself its that good 
but it didnt ive never really watched buffy of joss whedons other series but im a huge sci fi fan and was essentially obligated to watch at least a few episodes my wife watched with me as well i was surprised to say the least and she fell in love with the show this will be a christmas present for her and shell be ecstatic to see it and ill really enjoy seeing the episodes we missed because of fox re watching the other episodes and checking out the extras 
after viewing all the episodes in this great collection i am dumbfounded as to why the show was cancelled was it because fox tv would rather pay peanuts for inane claptrap reality shows or maybe they dont want to ruin their reputation and be associated with a well written highly entertaining original show 
i was never able to catch firefly while it was on television i look back at how horribly marketed the series was while on its television run and realise that i was never going to catch it i was however intrigued when it got a dvd release two years ago having been told that it was worth a check i gambled it and bought the set it is possibly my most treasured dvd now and it sits within my top must have dvds once you put the first episode on and watch it you will be enticed to sit and watch through all four discs as each character created for this series works so well chemistry wise and make such a remarcable world that thrown together with the best special effects incredible writting and highest production value i have seen on an television sci fi series culminates on the apex of television series some of the most quotable lines you will hear laugh out loud moments and incredible surprises captain mals crew navigates firefights sword duels russian mobsters in space crazed space canibals and many other surprises that will keep these characters on your memory for a long while after you watched this i have also since purchasing this set re watched it three of four times only proving the great re watch value this set has great moments includes richard brooks bounty hunter who is menacing as well as has a hearing problem captain mals sudden wife who puts the ship in danger the sword duel between mal and lor atherton and so many other great situations i have forced many of my friends to buy this and after watching it they have always thanked me 
this was a great show i watched serenity first which led me here and now i am hooked i wish i had known about this show when it was on tv 
a few years ago i was browsing the family selection when i came upon this boxed set that one of my family members apparently had acquired i had never heard of firefly so i wasnt too interested in a tv series that i had never heard of before after not finding anything else i reluctantly put the first disc into the player and i have to tell you i couldnt stop watching it everything about this show is expertly done the stories the characters the acting everything even the humor adds to the show which is something i find to be rare in shows like this after watching every single episode i wanted more even after watching the fantastic serenity movie i wanted more im frustrated how this great of a show was cancelled while others that are quite frankly crap run rampant on several channels im just sad that i couldnt have supported this show when it still mattered anyway i recommend this show to anyone buy it especially now that its at a discounted price its a show that youll have to watch all the way through multiple times during your lifetime im glad to see that this series has been rated so well and abundantly on amazon it deserves it 
and sadly it was cancelled after half of a season i am normally not much of a science fiction fan but this series blew me out of the water it has such an original take on the future by mixing spaceships and the old west this series also has so many great funny moments that you never get tired of watching any of the shows wash and his dinosaurs its also the only show ive watched in which i like all of the main characters each person brings an element to the show that would be missed terribly if they werent there i highly recommend owning this series 
ive been more than happy watching firefly on dvd for the past few years now that i have it on blu ray i wish i had bought the set a long while ago the main menus on the discs is a beautiful nicety and the play all feature is definitely worth it what is really impressing is the minute details i couldnt have seen in the dvds every scene that looked questionable on dvd is infused with a breath of clarity it might seem minor to some but the attention to detail is what i watch sci fi for all the pretty tech toys and the sound finally almost reaches what id like to hear id love to hear this through a program though i will admit i was hoping there would be a bit more special features there is a nice sit down with some of the cast that was previously unavailable but itd been nice to see the done the impossible dvd included to have all the features in one box set maybe the those left behind mini graphic novel i would probably never bought this blu ray at the list price but the amazon offer is currently an amazing deal i dare say the details and value are more than worth the price of admission its time to upgrade 
firefly was a show that presented deep characters in interesting situations the characters aside from being very well developed form a unique collection who are only thrown together by the strangest of situations this is really unlike any other tv series ive ever seen and much better i liked this show when it was on tv but being able to see the shows in their proper order i now really love this show and am eagerly awaiting the movie 
the first thing i look for when i want to watch a new show on tv or go see a movie is if it has a firefly cast member in it if it does i know i will like it whatever it is when i saw serenity at the theater it was the first time i was happy to be at a sold out show every seat in the house was full usually i wait to see a film because i dont like to be disturbed by others but in this instance i was happy to feel connected to so many people that felt the same way about the show that i did 
not enough can be said for this show each episode had my wife and i on the edge of our seat wondering what is going to happen next we laughed she cried we loved this show and ache for more characters all have something you dont just like but you love about each of them you care about the characers their choices and their consequences great humor and glib dialogue some of the best lines written for the screen the chines swearing is actually a wonderful touch espeically since my wife is chinese and understands sometimes what the american accents are butchering more than satisfactory special effects great plots storylines this is a well well thought out show that should see another season or cant wait till the serenity movie next month give us more 
this series is wonderful it has the tongue in cheek humor that just keeps you coming back for more it reminds me of harrison fords role in the early star wars trilogy crossed with mad max i loved it 
people have told me for so long to check this show out so i finally caved in all i can say is i cant believe this show got canned its truly one of the best sci fi shows ever created and it manages to be such without over costumed and over madeup characters monsters or eye popping effects i was hooked from the first episode tight cast great premise competent writing wonderful atmosphere the chemistry between these actors is amazing its a shame a gem like this gets pulled off the air after only one year while complete trash stays on for season after season if you like great intelligent sci fi treat yourself to this you wont be disappointed oh and for all those who complain about them swearing in mandarin cause its cool they dont do it cause its cool they do it because it makes sense read up on some history people assimilated into another culture are bound to adopt said culture and its language after years decades centuries of chinese american alliance why wouldnt these people be fluent in chinese duh 
i enjoyed this show when it first aired on fox and i loved it even more after buying the set ive shown my dvds to different people and they bought their own sets these last two reviewers talked about the writing appealing only to teens whedon nonsense mediocre music etc they could not be more wrong this show is meant for the and older crowd and those who are the more mature at and younger included for those who expected aliens scary monsters grand space battles the less mature crowd you may not like firefly or maybe you will 
although i watched this series first run in all its confusion droppped cash for three not one boxed sets must indoctrinate and wait eagerly for the september th now are we sure universal cuz i have to clear my calendar soon i wanted to toss my hat in the ratings ring anyhoo to anyone purchasing or thinking of purchasing this boxed set sight unseen i caution you to watch the heres how it was documentary and hopefully it will help you to understand that in the midst the reality series craze there were some trying to make a show they actually cared about on a network that was once known for being the banner carrier against network madness remember faux in the beginning when we all cheered as it gained ground against the behemoths abc cbs and nbc with its unseemingly popular married with children the simpsons and the first few years of the x files wither thou rupert murdock throughout recent years it seems the only way to get a science fiction tv show on air is to take scripts from the biggest soap operas re write them on a space ship toss in an alien or two make sure to highlight a tense sexual triangle and call it science fiction firefly was something more and the only consolation in the series being cancelled is that without the outcry the surge in dvd sales and overwhelming internet word of mouth there would be no movie with the rough cut previews in select cities during the month of may selling out in mere hours it is a little vindication for a series full of characters we genuinely cared about in a den of theives up yours faux 
theres nothing this humble fan could say that hasnt been said by other reviewers and said better i loved the entire dvd set i couldnt stop watching and never watched an episode i didnt like i always came away smiling and engaged by the characters hurray huzzah cant wait for more if there is more loved firefly loved buffy moderately appreciated angel 
i had heard that firefly was really good and read the multitude of reviews here on amazon most of them stars and now that ive watched the entire series including serentity the movie i agree in my opinion firefly is very nearly the perfect tv series its only real flaw is that it ends after episodes the show is a wonderful blend of dialog action humor mystery setting character science soundtrack and visual appeal put all together its a show to watch again and again for me that fact uniquely makes the purchase of this collection the best bargain of all 
i am a late convert to the firefly fandom i had a friend who let me borrow the set after watching the first disc i bought my own copy it is a terrible shame that fox sucks when it comes to knowing what the public will like this show was not given half a chance fox did not even air the pilot until much later the story is of a capt mal reynolds and his crew all of which endear themselves to you mal just wants to keep flying of course the story takes place in space but there are no hokey aliens the bad guys are the government i love it already of course there are reavers and other no goods trying to get the captain and his crew i love firefly because i love the crew and i love the ship everyone has their faults but they all work together and have become family some of my favorite scenes are when the crew is eating together or playing ball i feel that joss whedon has done a superb job of characterization with each member you only git more in more hooked as ya watch this is the best damn tv show if you love sci fi with a western twist this is more than that do not hesistate 
what a great series fun to watch humorous thought provoking touching superb and once again corporate suits step in to destroy a gem idiots 
i am thoroughly impressed with the show the characters story humor everything is great with buffy and angel it took several episodes before the characters really started to win me over i think i liked all of them in firefly from the very moment they were introduced over all im very pleased with this series its a shame it was canceled 
when i heard firefly was a space western i made a face im not much of a fan of either sci fi or westerns but since it was joss whedons work i knew i had to give it a chance he proved me wrong about buffy and i was hoping hed do the same with firefly as it turns out firefly surpassed all my hopes and expectations its quality television at its best the characters are fleshed out the storys well thought out and everything comes together wonderfully the characters start off as strangers but warm up to you and each proves to be individual yet endearing in their own way and you begin to sympathize and care for the crew of firefly whedon takes his time to flesh out his characters at a pace thats neither too rushed nor too laxed its just right perfectly comfortable the character of river for instance starts off a complete looney simpering and frail and by the end you just love her to bits and you start realizing shes not the most vulnerable one on the crew perhaps shes even the strongest each actor plays his her part as if they were born to play it especially the nathan fillion mal morena baccarin inara and summer glau river whedons genius is his ability to make anything about the characters and keep it human too many shows get carried away by their own genre too many people make sci fi shows just for the sake of having a sci fi show for example how many times have you seen a show with ho hum characters and storylines but boasted an interesting concept the characters seem like just vehicles to carry out the story of their environment then there are the dramas that are about nothing except characters and their relationships and you wish more external circumstances reality could be taken into consideration joss whedon strikes the perfect balance between the two and firefly boasts a fascinating intelligent concept while maintaining characters that are fleshed out lively personable charismatic and live the story rather than just play it out if you saw it on tv and it confused you its probably because fox showed the episodes out of order a few people have said that they loved firefly after watching the dvds since whedon arranged the episodes to show in the order it was intended to be aired in this is one of the best shows ive seen in a while by far give it a try 
i only had the opportunity to watch this show acouple of times before it was cancelled and i was hooked i wish that it would have made it to the second season but fox has a great history of making great shows and then cancelling them futurama soon to be arrested development etc 
i took a bit of a risk buying this set id never seen a single episode but read the super positive reviews on amazon and figured i couldnt not like it while it took a few episodes to kick in firefly proved to be a very unique original and wonderful series typical of any joss whedon show buffy the vampire slayer angel firefly is filled with humorous and witty dialogue well thought out and deep characters and a plethora of secrets within the episodic plot underlying the entire show is a very original and interesting mix of a futuristic world with the familiar elements of the wild west theres one scene with a gang of henchmen riding through the desert on horseback while the rich man rides on a slick hovercraft the only drawback of this show is the fact that its incomplete due to the fact that it was cancelled mid season such a shame because theres so much potential for it to blossom into a really good show so much was left unanswered why is river wanted so badly by the authorities whats gonna happen between malcolm and inara whats gonna happen with simon and kaylee what is shepherd book all about hopefully some of those questions will be answered in the upcoming film version of the show called serenity but if youre a sci fi fan buffy fan joss fan or just a fan of great tv shows i highly recommend you check out firefly its truly one of the best shows ive ever seen 
i was highly disappointing when the show was cancelled but at least joss whedon was able to make a movie out of it the pic of actors actresses for this show was superb and they all did an awesome job one of the best sci fi series that i have ever seen 
i watched most of the series at my uncles house this weekend this is so unfair i remember watched this series when it first came out and not being able to understand it because i came into what i thought was the middle of the season it was not in fact the middle of the series that was where it really started with episode that was why i was so confused firefly has gained another fan i will be one till i die basic plot is standard two different factions fight a war one side the alliance had more guns and ships than the other side the disorganized and poorly armed independents they do not lack for courage but the independents are forced to give way in the face of superior fire power six years later those independents who have the guts have hightailed it to the end of space finding an uneasy niche amongst the smugglers pirates and other unsavory types that run the different systems the series follows the adventures of one of these crews i dont understand why this show was canned especially when you play the episodes in the order they were meant to be viewed so the plot makes some type of sense the people in charge of fox are idiots but i guess they had to make room for joe millionaire trust me any of you that had a problem with this series when it was aired because the episodes were being aired out of sequence are not alone i urge you to buy the dvd and may your experience with this fresh original and unjustifiably canceled show be as positive as mine wasoverall i hope the firefly will be the star trek of the st century but it probably will not be because there is no justice in the world remember guys quot you cant take the sky from me quot been dying to say that 
i have to say i love this universe if you like westerns with a twist not just that it takes place in outer space and on different planets youll like this the sequel film is equally brilliant too 
what firefly did was create a great ensemble cast that play their roles so perfectly i still marvel at it every time i watch an episode i knew i was going to love it when the pilot episode opened with wash the ships pilot playing with plastic dinosaurs while waiting for the crew to finish a heist the movie serenity extends the story and fills in some of the past the effects are well done its not lord of the rings but theyre good there is great action but its the cast and their relationships that make this movie and series so special its not that the acting is oscar quality per se its that the characters are so real this is in contrast to the last three star wars films where the acting is so stilted and wooden you dont care who gets killed or about anything else for that matter note that i loved the original trilogy for the same reason as firefly serenity the way the cast chemistry worked humor anger angst sadness all of them ring true in the way they play off each other mal the captain is perfect as the ex soldier who cares for his crew but tolerates no challenge to his authority but has a good sense of humor ron glass does a great job as shepard book its hard not to like kaylee the engineer and my favorite tough guy jayne alec baldwin who is by far the funniest character uhhhh i been workin on a new plan what say we shoot her first at the end of the day thats what made this series so special the characters are genuine and easy to care about there is just that chemistry thats present in any good series film between the cast every episode provided good action and comic relief if i had to use one word to decribe the series film it would be fun i have every episode on my ipod as well as serenity and i watch them every time i travel for business which is fairly often i own over dvds and am a pretty serious movie buff i would rate firefly serenity in the top because its just such a good ride dont miss this one 
 firefly is a series i never got to watch while it was on tv my beautiful wife really dislikes science fiction and i would rather spend time with her than watch anything on tv however i am a big science fiction fan so when my sweetheart is otherwise occupied i enjoy watching reasonably good sci fi if it is available but i would have never bothered with this series had it not been for an essay by one of my favorite authors orson scott card praising the movie serenity and by connection the series firefly i first bought the movie and rather liked it but wasnt getting something about it then recently while on a vacation i bought the complete firefly series on dvd and just loved it firefly is exactly what you want in a sci fi drama wonderfully acted incredibly believable visually and a very good story again it is a shame that the fox network more than any other gets it right when choosing series and then gets it so so wrong when it comes to cancelling series and in some cases about marketing dvds but i digress if you enjoy sci fi even a little bit you should find firefly a worthy investment of your time and money and then after you have watched the series watch the movie serenity you will be glad you did 
its the number selling dvd of all time on amazon even now years after the shows end its in the top sold each day it is that good even if you dont like science fiction you will like this show while its set in some far off galaxy its not about that its about people plain and simple great stories with drama action and humor please fox or nbc or whomever owns the rights to this fantastic show please bring it back 
love me some nathan fillion worst show to be cancelled ever i hope sometime adown the line they bring the series back with as much of the original cast as possible or at least another movie must watch for any sci fi junky 
after finally being able to see all the episodes in the order they were meant to be seen i am really really pod at fox for messing up another brilliant series remember the tick freaky links the family guy fox only wants dumb reality shows these days they cost nothing to produce they dont have to pay any talented actors writers or effects shops any money so until america tunes out the reality shows dont watch them amazing shows like this will never have a chance when you are finished watching this series i was hooked by episode you will feel the same way these episodes are not enough this series should have had a long long run just as whedons btvs and angel joss whedon wants to release a feature film of this series in the next year or two lets keep our fingers crossed that this gets done and the person s that gave this show the axe will eat crow 
im a joss whedon fan and pre ordered this long before its release i didnt think i could go wrong with joss despite it being cancelled in the us and never having seen the screened episodes being from australia and i was right from the beginning the production values and acting talent are of the highest quality however i almost dropped the rating back to stars because of a few relatively quot slow quot episodes where characters were being established or too much time was spent on quot guns and horses quot or where an episodes plot seemed too derivative of other old tv and movie cliches but then i realised i was being unduly harsh judging firefly against the impossibly high standards of buffy firefly fails to be as quot funny quot as buffy often was but gains ground for some of its audience by being more adult and much more morally ambiguous on any objective measure this show is easily in the top and therefore a worthy quot stars quot i suspect the critics of this show didnt bother to see past a few of those cliches to perceive the strength of early character development and overall story arcs being established the seeds of several such arcs are clear and bulging with potential and it is frustrating to think that we may never see the fuller realisation of those ideas although i understand a film is rumoured and if the dvd release is successful then who knows 
definitely worth it such a great series any whedonite or you know breathing person can enjoy the content dvd came quickly in perfect shape special features are a little short but nothing to do with amazon the unaired episodes arent secret simply the ones that werent on network tv if you like firefly invest in serenity same in reverse 
whats that your super geeky brother wont stop talking about how amazing firefly is and youre ready to launch him into outer space along with the darn show hang on a minute sister listen and listen well this show is amazing wonderful well written funny poignant entertaining in short your brothers right buy the box set already and curl up for some great television if you like westerns sci fi a little romance good comedy youre going to like firefly youre welcome 
ive never seen a tv series where all the episodes were top notch stories firefly would be a first extraordinary story telling special effects and character development throughout youll love the constant humor which would sometimes appear in unexpected situations the last episode about the bounty hunter sort of leads into the serenity movie since we are given a sneek peak into rivers special abilities let me just comment on the packaging a best ive ever seen the dvds are enclosed in attractive ultra thin plastic cases each one containing episode descriptions simply beautiful all this for a reasonable price cant ask for anything more on the opposite end have you seen the horrendous packaging for star trek voyager scuff filled dvd holders held together on the side by tape enclosed in cheap clear plastic with bonus disk hanging on the side wrapped around with a piece of paper sticky residue youd think with the money they charge the packaging would at least be semi decent 
there isnt anything i can say that hasnt already been said about this short lived sci fi masterpiece except maybe that they need to make a serenity sequel brown coat for life yo if you havent seen this show i dont know you and i dont wanna know you 
the fox network it seems has a history of being quick on the draw when it comes to pronouncing judgment on their offerings sometimes that is a good thing fox has canceled many a ludicrous and mind numbingly inane series however sometimes they have canceled series with much promise never has fox messed up so badly as when they canceled firefly they took a cursory look at the ratings th in the nielsen ratings with about million viewers per episode and tossed this wonderful series in the trash can they never even gave it much of a chance having only aired of the of the finished episodes and aired them out of order with the pilot serenity being aired later than other episodes in short fox just seemed totally uninterested in supporting this series from the start i am not a big fan of television anymore as a matter of fact i canceled my cable service months ago because programming is just so bad these days however i do have netflix which allows me to stream quality shows i want to see i had never even heard of the series but after seeing gushing praise for firefly on the pharyngula blog i dialed it up on netflix and oh boy did i ever get a treat ive been a fan of written and visual science fiction for decades and as such have experienced it from many angles both good and not so good with firefly i saw sci fi in a way i had never seen it before i had of course heard of the term space western and have seen elements of that concept in shows like star trek and in movies like star wars and avatar however until now i had never seen the space western theme realized in such a literal way the juxtaposition between spaceships and horses and space stations and frontier towns is a delight to watch the storylines are sometimes straight out of westerns such as the train heist in the train job josh whedon however flawlessly interweaves the two seemingly at odds thematic elements and the result is phenomenal episodes and a great followup theatrical release serenity there is an equal mix of drama humor and action in this series and just when you think you know what direction an episode is going to take whedon takes it in a totally different direction rarely is television so well scripted especially these days interesting concept aside no television show is worth much if the characters are not believable or interesting firefly has great character development all the main characters are through both scripting and acting fully fleshed out human beings who we grow to deeply care about as we progress through the series you can tell that the actors really cared about their roles because their performances effortlessly exude the characters as they were conceived by whedon through these portrayals come the series great strength a tale of desperate people of disparate backgrounds who find themselves linked in a particular place and time we see the love and anger the humor and sadness and we identify with them we want to be with them on serenity living the lives that they lead all in all i think that the fox network executive who made the decision to dump this series should be hog tied and deposited on the deck of a ship full of starving amorous reavers television is almost never this good and if firefly had been allowed to run its originally planned full seasons i believe it would be referred to by the general tv viewing public as one of the all time great series even if youre not a fan of sci fi get this anyway this series first and foremost is about people not spaceships 
with over reviews ill get lost in the shuffle but suffice it to say this series was taken far too soon so soon that joss was so freakin upset he went on a rampage and was unstoppable until serenity was made as a buffy angel fan i should have known this would be just as good i just saw this a month ago so im late to the show and sorry i didnt become a browncoat years ago when the series was on the air nevertheless i came to love this show and feel such regret that we only got one season and not even episodes such a treasure and so ripped out from under us if you think it looks grungy confusing and bleak which i did originally just try the first episode and youll fall in love with the oh so wonderful and engaging characters dont let the sci fi western surface fool you into turning away you have to give this a chance and youll be a fan before you can get the second disc in your dvd player 
i havent yet watched this on blu ray as i received it only today however ive watched it on dvd and tv and love love love the show now being in a blended family im hoping the rest of the family will enjoy the ship and crew as much as i had 
i could only hope that firefly has the same post cancellation success and impact that a gene roddenberry series once had with john q public i had enjoyed the buffy and angel shows for their wit and heart and humor when i heard that joss whedon was about to release a sci fi series with a western flair i was very curious and excited the good news is that firefly lived up to my expectations joss delivered with the same key elements that made buffy and angel so much fun to watch the characters all seemed to breathe and resonate the stories were interesting the f x were believable i grew to care for mal jayne and the rest of the serenity crew then came the cancellation and thus a whole lotta woebegone looks on my face then thank the idiot box gods the dvd came out and now im frothing at the mouth to see the cinematic version hopefully serenity will spawn another firefly t v series and will go on to live long and prosper by the way a shoutout to spike and faith id heard that joss wasnt gonna do anything with the buffy universe in the near future but cmon now 
look if youre reading this review chances are you are someone you love really knows what the deal is about this show its smart fun sultry touching intelligent has big explosions great storylines and great characters if youre here youre likely going to enjoy the dvd or whoever youre getting it for trust me 
i never saw this show when it was actually on tv but from what i understand from a friend when we started watching it on netflix he said it was good that i was getting to see it that way because apparently fox screwed up the order of the show when they aired it supposedly they had decided after theyd signed on with the show for the st season that they didnt think it would be very popular and therefor were going to cancel it after the first season and then for whatever reason they decided to just show it in any random order it did in fact become pretty popular despite this so fox made a big mistake in doing this there are so many people out there who would have loved to see this show continue but of course fox is notorious for fouling things up makes me sick at least joss was able to tie it off in the movie serenity anyway its not often i buy tv on dvd blu ray normally ill just rewatch shows on netflix or something however i did really love this show and i had serenity on blu ray so i finally just decided to pick this up on blu ray to go with it totally worth while show its an interesting blending of sci fi and western the characters are all cool in their own ways i think my favorite is probably ms kaylee frey shes like my hollywood dream girl shes so lovable and funny the whole cast adds some great character to the whole show all around though while its sad that the show was cut so short the little bit there is of it is memorable and entertaining and worth watching more than once which is why it was worth it to me to buy the set and the follow up movie serenity if youre a fan of sci fi and have never seen this before then i highly recommend checking it out friends 
the dvd collection of firefly the complete series was clearly a labor of love for those who made the series it includes the eleven episodes originally aired on the fox television network plus three unaired shows commentary on fully half the episodes and a large assortment of extras as a courtesy to the tv fans of firefly this review contains no spoilers firefly was often described as a space western set years in the future when a large number of planets and moons have been terraformed many frontier planets are subsisting with little more than basic th century tools horses wagons cattle lever action rifles and the like but this is the future when america and china were the clear winners of the race for cultural dominance so every backwater yokel can curse in chinese as well as twangy american idiom and newspapers have moving text malcolm reynolds played by nathan fillion and zoe warren gina torres are survivors on the losing side of the war to unite all the planets to gain some freedom from the encroaching forces of the victorious alliance they purchase an old transport ship of the firefly class named serenity for the battle of serenity valley where they lost the war the ships crew was fleshed out with pilot wash warren zoes husband played by alan tudyk mechanic kaylee frye jewel staite and muscle jayne cobb adam baldwin they later pick up some passengers companion futuristic geisha inara serra morena baccarin doctor simon tam sean maher and his troubled genius sister river summer glau and shepherd preacher book ron glass ill leave the show summary there no spoilers remember but just point out that one of the hallmarks of joss whedon shows is how people who arent related become family in its short run firefly was a shiny example of family building now on to the dvd collection the dvd set consists of discs each in individual plastic holders and an outer cardboard sleeve the only difference in the packaging is a different cast member portrait for each plastic box each disc is pressed with the same image of the firefly title there are no extra materials in the packaging heres a breakdown of the contents of each disc disc one picture of nathan

was the making of firefly deleted scenes serenity the th character alan tudyks audition gag reel joss tours the ship joss sings the firefly themethe episodes originally aired on the fox television network starting with the train job and continued in order through episode war stories then came objects in space and after the series had been cancelled finally the pilot fox has a long history of starting science fiction shows usually on friday evenings but giving them only a short run before yanking them off the air skipping the pilot of firefly didnt help the show gain a following remember werewolf alien nation the adventures of brisco county jr m a n t i s vr strange luck space above and beyond kindred the embraced brimstone harsh realm freaky links dark angel or the lone gunmen all of these were fox shows most of them were cancelled shortly after their debut the dvd collection restores the shows to their proper order for a short lived series firefly had a respectable assortment of guest stars recurring villains include mark a sheppard as badger michael fairman as niska and christina hendricks as saffron bridget yolanda whoever more notable one shot guests include edward atterton richard brooks richard burgi melinda clarke william converse roberts larry drake gregg henry isabella hofmann and carlos jacott viewers of joss whedons other shows will spot several familiar faces firefly the complete series is a star entertainment package with plenty of additonal material for fans of the series the actual production of the dvd set is disappointing in several ways though pioneer disc manufacturing corporation pdmc did their usual annoying job of arranging the dvd menus using a number of phantom titles that cause slow repeated disc seeks for each menu selection theyve also buried the many disc commentary selections three levels deep under language selection on the positive side all the chapter stops are placed properly and the video and audio transfer are both good heres how it was the making of firefly includes commentary by all nine of the cast gina torres appears in costume speaking of her character in the present tense all the others came back after cancellation to add their remembrances of the show also in this retrospective are joss whedon tim minear jane espenson producer gareth davies chris buchanan president of mutant enemy chinese translator jenny lynn kelly wheeler assistant to the producer camera operator allen easton visual effects supervisor loni peristere associate producer lisa lassek and composer greg edmonson the fact that they could get nine different people to come back to provide audio commentary for the dvd collection and as many more for the retrospective of the series is a strong indication of the commitment these people have for firefly lets hope the anticipated firefly movie gets to fruition 
when i watched the first episode on fox i hated this show then the brilliance of the setting and characters quickly won me over this series short though it is ranks right up there with babylon as having some of the most memorable characterization and stories ever sometimes it takes awhile for characters to win you over not firefly jayne is my hero lets all give a shout out to the spineless executives at fox who never gave this great show a chance to blossom you suck 
great collection of all of the episodes and some neat bonus content plus its in blu ray format so the picture sound quality is very good worth buying if you want to own the series 
one of the biggest travesties in television history was when in their infinite wisdom the fox network decided to cancel firefly i as i am sure is the case with many fans of original interesting programmes especially sci fi have a list a mile long of shows that i grew to love only to find them axed far too soon by tv execs who seem to think their viewing public wish it so clearly this is not the case however otherwise there would not be so many reviews complaining about such decisions out of all these shows nothing disappointed me more than to see firefly cancelled and ill tell you why because it had so much potential yet it never stood a chance i could go on to rant about how it was badly scheduled over in america but im sure everyone who is reading this write up knows about that so ill start with the positives that is to say what do i love about firefly firstly its an unlikely mixture cowboys in space that lapse into mandarin especially when swearing those censors never knew what hit em but it works thats because of the very excellent joss whedon his scripts brought warmth and depth to the characters as well as the subtle blend of action and humour which we have grown to know and love see also buffy and angel for further reference to his writing abilities what whedon does best is flesh out his leading protagonists so that they are actual people with quirks and habits not all of them good but all of them things that we can relate to as human beings so that they are more real it doesnt matter whether they are in a firefly class cargo vessel or fighting vampires at some high school josss people are simply that people they have heartaches and times in between the adventures that are just like you or i where they sit and talk and laugh and cry in the case of firefly its things like rivalry in the crew romantic entanglements and sometimes the lack there of and basically trying to survive out there in the black far from what is considered to be civilisation they are little people living big lives on the edge despite the inevitable interferance of the alliance a vast governmental agency that often gets in the way as governments have a tendency of doing another reason to watch personally speaking is the rather lovely mr nathan fillion i have been a fan of his work for some time and he does wear those unbelievably tight trousers what can i say im only human hence kaylees nickname of cptn tight pants see shindig before i lose all credibility can i just say he is also a talented actor who helps gel the cast together as indeed the crew in his capacity as cpt malcolm reynolds and what a crew every character has their own specific traits that make them appealing even jayne well maybe appealing isnt quite the right word in his particular case its also worth mentioning that there is an actual married couple on board they have arguements at times as couples often do but basically they are completely devoted to one another if anything was set to sway me on the marriage vote it would be wash and zoe they are solid and look set to remain so barring any unforseen circumstances ive seen serenity so i refuse to say more on that subject sigh finally onto the feature film i was so glad to see that after such relentless campaigning loyal browncoats were able to get serenity another outing hopefully not for the last time though another series of firefly seems like nothing but a beautiful dream lets hope movie execs will have seen the awesome response to the dvd release both in america and over here in england and also the impact of the movie and give a much loved little show more time on the big screen heres hoping in the mean time as the lyrics say so clearly you cant take the sky from me 
due to having to work on fridays i only caught two episodes when firefly was airing it didnt make alot of sense to me but it seemed funny and diffrent then it got cancelled a got the dvd set simply because there hasnt really been anything tremendously diffrent on tv and i remembered firefly as being someything of an oddity from the pilot episode to the bonus quot hero of canton quot song and everything in between i was completely enthralled in a two day marathon this show does everything right drama humor visuals music and charecters while breaking the rules of cinemotgraphe scifi and pretty much television i dont know if i can really explain firefly or why its now one of my favorite shows every its not that its all too complicated every little aspect just eminates so much wonder and heart the firefly world contained some the greatest charecters stories and concepts that i have ever seen plus some of the most memorable one liners to boot now that firefly seems too be finding more popularity after its cancellation may it fly again in some form or another 
i love this show what more can be said except that its sad no more episodes were made firefly and are probably the greatest shows to ever grace a television screen what a gem firefly was maybe its best that serenity tied it all together in the end instead of a series getting worn out it is what it is and it was great 
i do not watch any commercial television i decided years ago that i did not want to be forced to watch anymore commercials with the launching of netflix i am now able to catch up on many of the series i missed when they were first being aired minus those stupid commercials i was hesitant at first to watch this series and almost skipped over it however i did watch it and i can tell you by the end of the first episode i was hooked everything about this series was right cast members character developement story line even the space ship design struck up a good feeling reminding me of how i use to catch fireflies on a warm summer evening in ohio this show was a winner it had the markings of becoming so huge the other networks would be scrammbling to come up with some type of copycat programming yes i do believe the decision makers at fox are idiots 
firefly offers a feast to those starving for decent characters and story in film firefly is proof that film need be neither shallow nor amoral to be art we must be grateful firefly slipped through hollywoods mediocrity sieve undetected for the diamond it is can wheeden do it again i pray so 
at first it looks and sounds light and even amateurish and then you understand it is fully positioned on another level it is a mixture of several genres within the frame of a science fiction film entirely contained in and around a special spaceship called serenity a spaceship that is a firefly a bug a burning insect the first genre is the functional and psychological happenings within a team of nine people who are together for both the best and the worst in order to transform the worst into the best or at least the better by being together the team is limited to nine people a perfect diabolic and satanic number and no manipulation like serenity is the tenth character will take that dimension away nine is perfect because you always have at least one who is totally set apart from the regrouping of people into couples or pairs and in the end you wonder who is the one who is really apart who is totally odd alone because of the various and subtle compositions with only one couple that is really defined as such and all the others being transient multiple varied changing shifting at various levels of possible realization in a way it is star trek revisited but without all the hullaballoo that goes along with the soldiers the mechanics the petty personnel of a flagship the second genre is of course recurrent and varied too the western but in many realizations too of course we have the very traditional space western or space cowboy film like in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy seen from the point of view of the driver marooned on the side of the road after having been forced to lend his car but there is more we can think of other models dead or alive bonanza even mad max a vague allusion to star wars with the alliance a lot of jules verne william gibson and a few others even at times though they might not know it ron hubbard and the bordello in the desert is so close to some indian bordello in some bollywood classic we do not have john wayne and the indians but we can afford not to have that genocidal side of the western the next genre is more trendy and modern with some kind of loose and yet very emotional sensual erotic even life or imagination many allusions visual or linguistic and even here and there an allusion to gay people slack as they come up like in one episode though this side of personal life is warded off nicely and the allusion to crazy insane and yet envisaged incest was purely rejected from the series and is a supplementary scene meaning a censored one even if self censored we could go on for ever with that game but what is important is that the film or the series is highly original in the end it is deeply human and humane deeply attached to justice and fairness even with someone who trips into treachery for a slight moment or one episode at the same time it is ruthless and even maybe cruel by indifference like when bringing the millionaire to the easy lady he had made pregnant and whose child he had tried to steal knowing that he was going to be shot blank on the spot by the mother or also when they get rid of the bounty hunter by just pushing him into space where he is going to die slowly except of course if he shortens his life himself and commits suicide the series is also highly imaginative and each episode really has a knack and appeal of its or their own we enter the episode and we will be released only when the case is concluded each episode is perfectly self contained even when what is announced in one episode does not take place in the next one because the announcement is the punch line of the concerned episode and it would unbalance the next episodes if it were made true so they whirl around with a pirouette when they bother or they just forget or they think of it and discard it to the supplementary scenes self containment is the best quality of each of these episodes in other words quite a successful series that it is true found its magic achievement in that final symbolic metaphoric blending of serenity and river of the escaping spaceship and the mentally disarrayed girl then the team is one and the odd shot of that team becomes the heart and soul of it in this final blending the route has been run from the beginning to the end and the final harbor has been reached beyond all the deserts and dangers possible they can live happily ever after there is a certain fairy tale dimension in this series and it is one of its stronger assets dr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris pantheon sorbonne university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
i was originally told i should watch the buffy series and i got hooked on that and watched them all the same people suggested firefly and because it was from whedon i thought okay perhaps i rented disk and it sat around for days but then i saw that nathan fillion was in it and he was a fine sight to look at in the last episodes of buffy so i figured i should watch firefly thats all it took now there are no more episodes to watch and i can only dare to hope there will be more being over and long ago having posters of captain kirk on my wall these shows are a great improvement over star trek and star wars it is mind boggling that a show like this got cancelled so early while other shows less worthy go on and on dont let the western aspect of these shows turn you off it is refreshing and superbly done and yes captain reynolds you are tooooo pretty 
i first saw serenity at the movies and loved it what a ride and i have always liked joss whedons other series and friends have continually said you should see the firefly series i know you will like it so after seeing serenity i decided i want to know what came before and what a great albeit short series it is lots of fun adventure and drama all at the same time whether or not you are a joss whedon fan this is a great series to check out 
this is one of the very best sci fi series in a long time great characters good story lines and a solid cast i loved every episode i only wish they had done more seasons you will not be disappointed a great series to watch 
despite what may be the worst menu system ive ever encountered firefly is a superlative series we here in the us really miss the boat on smart and entertaining tv dark angel fierefly and the book of daniel they get the ax and reality tripe goes on ad nauseum 
item was as listed perfect fast shipping thx great seller would buy from again 
i like many other buffy fans tried to watch firefly when it was on tv and failed miserably this was due to many things mostly the fact that is was on friday night and because it was not shown in order and therefore made a minimum of sense much better on the dvd you get to watch everything in order on demand and without commercials i bought this at the fox studio store for and it was the best i ever spent like joss whedons other shows firefly blends the best of the dramatic out of gas with the humorous jaynetown for some truly excellent television the dvds are nicely packaged in individual slim cases so the discs arent constantly falling out and getting scratched like the buffy angel sets there are some neat extras too notably joss whedon singing the theme song his version is actually better than the one they used and an awesome audio track that makes it better than it ever could have been on tv buy this dvd set and see the movie serenity next year 
i bought this dvd because i knew that it would contain episodes that fox didnt show i found the overall dvd production w interviews etc to be more than i had expected fox should be ashamed of itself this was a truly interesting concept w believable and developed developing characters that i quickly came to care about p s im years old not the male age group they seem to cater to but ive got the money to buy stuff 
i had hesitated about this box set for awhile as i had heard mixed reviews after reading the reviews on amazon com and being desperate for something good to watch after the wb so inanely canceled angel i went ahead and picked up firefly let me say this is as good in its own way as buffy and angel any fan of joss whedon should love this well written thoughtful witty show it is the best in its genre i have ever seen i was thouroughly impressed with it and love it unfortunately it is entirely too fresh and just plain to good for mainstream tv to appreciate i cant wait for the movie and can only hope that maybe the movie will inspire the series to be resurrected on sci fi or some other worthy station joss whedon continually surprises us with his fresh shows that always keep us coming back for more buy this set you cant go wrong with it 
this show is what story telling is all about the most enjoyable television show i have ever seen 
i started watching this show when it came out on fox a couple of years ago and loved it the characters and stories were all well thought out being a space western the feel of the show was unique and the special effects were better than anything seen on tv however something always seemed a little weird like the episodes were out of order as it turns out my gut feelings were right what can only be called horribly management and scheduling by fox episodes were played out of order the hour series premiere was not shown first instead another episode started the series on tv jumping right into the middle of a plot line and characters that the audience didnt know eleven episodes later fox had done such a poor job promoting this critically acclaimed show that it was cancelled with another episodes left unaired these episodes are included fully produced on the dvd set so many firefly dvd sets have now been sold that universal studios has series creator joss whedon buffy and angel fame already filming a firefly big screen movie called quot serenity quot serenitymovie com i would encourage anyone to by the series you will be left wanting more which will be coming next spring 
like many i loved firefly the setting has long been praised and it is done well enough though there are better esp the traveller rpg verse there are worse the absense of ftl can give a feeling of hopelessness though you know that sooner or later they will take the sky from mal and his crew it is the characters that are best though the disadvantages should be given first there is considerable inappropriateness including nudity and sexual references there is a lot of casual violence too but at least it is appropriate to the setting the advantages of the show far outweigh such things fortunately unlike in some shows such things tend to be concentrated in a few parts so the more straitlaced like this reviewer can filter it fairly easily with a fast forward without disturbing the plot the crew of the serenity are what might be called space cossacks they are people gone into the wild to escape the confines of a large empire like the original cossacks they live by smuggling trade and banditry out on the borders of the alliance they go there for various reasons from resentment like mal to survival like the tams the tams are a classic example of noble fugitives like many a courtier in history who has run afoul of high class intrigue much of the show is a heroic portrayal of scotch irish morality with a strong emphasis on loyalty to the in group it is also reminder of the need for checks on centralized authority in a way the show is kind of a reverse of star trek being from the perspective of the crew of a lowly tramp ship instead of members of a large naval bureaucracy mal rules like a clan chieftain he is violent and unafraid to kill his sin really is wrath but he treats his crew like men and has a strong protective instinct zoe is his sidekick she unfortunately has a little developed personality but wash the pilot and her husband likes her a lot inara i never took to and thought her rather embarrassing she is sweet sensitive and considerate but i would agree with mal that a professional is a professional even if she gives herself a fancy name but she is plausible and there have been folk like her in history book is an interesting character because not many sci fis allow religion to come naturally jayne i quite disliked he has many fans but his fans really seem to love him because he is so hyperbolically despicable and repulsive that he seems to many to be lovable but somehow i find it hard to like someone who was a bully a traitor a coward yes he is despite his display a blowhard and insults a disturbed girl in front of her and her brother that is kind of the point though as for other characters well who could forget dear little kaylee the sweet little ms fix it she is cheerful cute and has a crush on the good dr simon who is prim awkward and most unfortunately very busy making returning such things difficult for him and thus leaving the viewer in suspense my favorite all the characters was river tam and her brother dr simon tam simon was the best and most complex of all of them he has an appealing combination of warmth and rationality he is softspoken polite except when being impolite is appropriate and rather dandyish but in a way he was the bravest of the crew he was willing to accept loss of status exile and peril because his sister was wronged and there was no one else to right it he is usually gentle and not a skilled fighter but he is at times as dangerous and as awe inspiring as you would expect from someone who has nothing left to lose but honor and a loved one he sacrificed everything for in times of stress he can remain remarkably calm and he is possessed of a tremendous determination he can be a self control freak sometimes and one suspects him of being haunted by irrational guilt at times his devotion to river approaches sainthood but he has hidden a latent fanaticism which we catch an occasional glimpse of and which seems quite human the higher one tries to climb the farther to fall he is most of the time a doting big brother and cares for her with such skills his profession allows him an out of specialty case but at least he knows how to learn on the job as well as the affection that perhaps she needs even more but when his sister is threatened he is as fierce as a wolf defending a cub he comes out as a very noble yet still human character and manages to be good while still being likable river is a great and sympathetic portrayal of a disturbed person mental affliction is a misfortune that one can fear looking at closely but river humanizes it she was rendered insane by government experiments and the alliance thinks her a precious commodity at times she is a normal girl and at other times she is very not normal it is simons mission to protect her and incidently protect others from her a job bigger then most young men face even those in the top three percent of med school the relationship between simon and river is beautiful and well presented it lifts the show up into the epic level the two are inseparable and feel themselves alone in a hostile world they sometimes provide moments of tears and sometimes provide moments of awe but do so in a homey way that looks believable river i didnt think you would come for me simon well youre a dummy it is more believable still when one realizes that even mere human love can at times be as spectacular and still look very much like that here one can as is sometimes the case learn the beauty of real flowers by seeing fairy flowers one essay once compared simon and mal and this seems at first glance a odd contrast simons city slicker perfectionism and mals ruffianly nature seem an odd fit they start off as rivals because the interests of those they respectively protect seem to clash but they slowly learn to respect each other and are alike in their protective instincts and in their determination firefly is a great production it has been widely praised by people of all kinds and has something for everyone one can hope that more sci fis will come that will be as good as firefly but there can never be another firefly 
somehow i started watching the show it was great i know that space opera is passe especially with audiences that fox goes after watching fox reality shows is not high on my list of things to do if i want reality ill watch the news it had blasters babes and bad guys what more do you want it wasnt kurasawa but it was better than any other weekly broadcast tivo was recording my fix and then the bottom fell out i plug into the net and discovered fox blew another one sigh it figures im just leaving the important fox demographics im not a teenager not uneducated not urban 
it still amazes me that this series didnt take off the writing was great the cast were wonderful the chemistry is there joss whedon did a fabulous job of putting this together i wish there had been more episodes 
my roomate recommended this series highly and one boring sunday afternoon we had nothing to do and he says quot jd were watching firefly quot i was a bit excited about it at first since my roomate knew i liked history and science fiction i knew it was joss whedon who wrote the script for quot alien resurrection quot which i liked but i never got to liking quot angel quot or quot buffy quot so id figure it was worth a shot and boy was i surprised we watched the first disc and some of the second disc straight through i laughed i sighed i screamed i enjoyed i had never seen anything like this before when we finished the series and later watched the special features i knew i had to buy it you can read the amazon review for the plot it wont take much to adapt to the quot whedonese quot or the chinese cursing what really will get your attention is that there arent any aliens at all through the run and the characters are flat out amazing as a writer myself the characters that whedon creates are some of the best that ive ever watched on tv or film incredible writing and special effects augment this series along with the plain reality of it all so its years in the future who says weve got warp speed who says violence has ended whedon sticks it plain when the crew of the serenity are looking for jobs to keep them afloat rather than make first contact with an alien race there are plenty of little things that you will enjoy from this collection the camera and special effects take advantage of the zoom lens which youll learn in the features section that mostly everyone not with the quot firefly quot team thought was cheesy the music is incredible for example since space is a vacuum we dont hear anything in the cgi scenes except for wonderful violins and guitars you see the cast is really a family when the camera stops and when you watch the quot making of quot featurette youll see how heartbreaking it was for this cast to all of a sudden wrap up and end production the cast whedon strings together a cast of actors that most people dont know nathan fillion tvs quot two guys a girl and a pizza shop quot and adam baldwin various movies and appearances are the biggest names you might know but either way the actors stick their characters without any flaws apparently million viewers werent enough for fox who pretty much killed this series props to universal for producing the movie which may just be the first in a trilogy either way expect fox to be brooding for a long time 
i mostly skipped firefly when it was first broadcast viewed only a few snippets and they didnt do much for me when the dvd set came out i bought it just for the heck of it id heard that it was pretty good and then proceeded to drive my girlfriend crazy by watching it every chance i could find i think i went through all the episodes inside of days needless to say i love this show on the surface its a natural i like westerns and s f among other things but thats only the surface the appeal is in the originality whedon and co have created a unique future universe and one which in its own way is very real more importantly the characters come across as real living breathing people part of that is the brilliance of the writing and part of it is the brilliance of the acting what more can i say that over others havent already said if you buy this dvd set i hope you end up loving this wonderful show as much as i do and i cant wait for serenity the movie and the next chapter in the story 
i remember when firefly first came out and was so highly publicized by fox the funny thing was that i was desperate for a good sci fi and foxs brilliant decision to air the nd episode instead of the pilot cost them at least one viewer not that the nd episode was bad but just a little hard to follow without any background after all the opening scene has cowboy looking crew mates getting into a brawl in a tavern only to be saved by their spaceship at cliffs edge immediately i turned it off and thought nothing of it i remember thinking cowboys in space years later a friend invited me to see the movie serenity and i loved it it was later that another friend informed me that it had been the original firefly series with a lot more knowledge of the characters from the movie i watched an episode on sci fi and immediately fell in love with it for xmas my wife and i purchased the dvd set and watch the whole series in one day from start to finish the entire series is exceptional way better than most of the shows that manage to survive on the television and i can only shudder to think that its because of a bonehead executive deciding they didnt want to give this highly touted by them show hours to introduce itself i loved the pilot while its true that there is a certain wild west feel to the show firefox has so many elements that make it good there is tension compassion and lots of humor some of which can be campy its a definite sci fi show but on the edge of the frontier something i wish star trek might have explored id highly recommend this show to you especially if you are into sci fi or even westerns great series that ill re watch over and over if only we could convince sci fi to make some new episodes 
firefly is a sad sad story of a progressive well written well produced show that got booted way before its time fox televisions decision to give the show the worst real estate in prime time fridays at pm its pre empting by other shows and sports events not playing the episodes in order and their refusal to promote the show beyond a few commercials surely contributed to its low ratings it was hard to find and confusing to watch never the less critics praised it and anyone who watches it at least everyone i know including my wife who is not a sci fi fan loves it this show is a greek tragedy you could easily say this was the star trek for the next millennium a sci fi western that mirrored gene rodenberrys idea of wagon train in space not to say that the creator joss whedon was inspired by star trek not at all firefly is more liberal and more relatable to the real world what shines is the cast and the writing the ingredients and settings are only slightly out of the ordinary and in the hands of any average tv creator would end up being bland and boring but the characters in firefly are so well cast and the episodes so well written that they stand out as real and tangible people who are cast together on this small ship for a purpose the story takes place years in the future where a civil war has just ended and capt malcolm reynolds has gathered together an eclectic crew to take on jobs in an old freighter ship called serenity firefly class the ship is one of those so ugly but cool hang in there old girl shell hold together rely on in a pinch flying buckets that everyone is so glad to see come over the horizon that its no wonder whedon considers it the tenth character on the show always low on fuel its like the millennium falcon in star wars its destined to become a lovable freighter and not a high tech ship of exploration the difference in characters of the human class is staggering you have a two soldiers the captain and his second hand man err woman zoe zoes husband wash who is the pilot a mercenary jayne which is a great contrast when played by the muscle bound adam baldwin a registered companion inara kaylee the spunky young mechanic who loves her ship but is obviously too young to know better a doctor and his sister simon and river who are being pursued by the alliance due to rivers extreme mental intelligence and to add wisdom theres book a holy man of the time who seems to be searching for himself the dynamics of the characters add to instructing personality studies and contrasts they find themselves with nothing in common and sometimes everything in common when they need each other most the possibilities of this show are endless and fox foolishly dropped it without giving it a fair chance the dvd contains all episodes including three that never aired the sound and picture quality are superb and the bonus features are great everyone should give this show a chance to see it for more than just the sci fi aspect more than just the space adventure but as a study in character interaction as well if it gains popularity like the original star trek maybe well be lucky and there will be a next generation version in twenty years 
i went and saw the movie after it came out on video and had to see all the episodes of the show itself after seeing the final one i can say that this show was absolute perfection its like star wars told from the perspective of han solo rather than luke skywalker with the gunslinging smuggler and his crew being the main focus in the war against some galactic empire rather than some mystical jedi knight also the wars over the rebels lost and all is under the dominion of the galactic empire alliance which is mysterious while being deceptively kind and civilized as all governments are in fact i almost wonder if joss whedon is a libertarian there are some subtle anti government elements in the show such as in the vein of is is just me or is anti statism a major theme in most sci fi this show has the best of all the elements great actors and actresses playing great characters with great dialogue great plots plot twists music whom hasnt memorized the lyrics to the theme song by the end its mostly a sci fi western with some elements of horror who was freaked out by the blue gloved men and their antics in the aerial episode and really great casual humor as well who wasnt roaring in laughter during the episode where jayne was mistaken by a town as some kind of robin hood esque hero if you dont think that this show will go down as legendary then name one other show that got cancelled after only eleven aired episodes fourteen total and yet had such a huge cult following of fans built around it that they made a movie out of it in short this series is absolute bliss and well worth your purchase 
i had never watched this program before and am amazed how i could have overlooked this awesome show the characters really clicked together the story lines the dialogue of the characters the action the entire series is excellent it ranks right up there with stargate sg a truly well written and filmed program i only wish there were more seasons it ended far too soon i can hardly wait for the movie version 
a fabulous series that was killed in its first season shame on hbo for allowing whomever to kill this great sci fi series the action is great and the story is believable this is the story of a group of misfits who end up together in a space ship that goes around from planet to planet just trying to scrap together a living but always ended up in trouble the cast is fantastic it makes me a big fan of nathan fillion and youll love the other cast members one of them is now the alien leader in the new series v another is the cyborg in the series terminator nathan now has a new series castle so i like their new stuff but im sad there will not be anymore episodes of this fabulous series this one is worth twice what i had to pay for it 
firefly is simply one of the greatest shows ever made its cancellation is unforgivable nothing else needs to be said 
im always at a bit of a loss as to how to describe my favorite tv series to others for the first time i usually settle for something along the lines of its a sci fi space western action comedy drama that was cancelled halfway through its first season on tv when i see the look of confused shock on their faces its time to elaborate a bit more seriously firefly has everything one could ask for in entertainment the writing is original and witty the humor is wickedly funny especially as delivered by the incredibly talented and likable cast there are moments for every person and every mood this is the only show i have ever watched that can both make me laugh out loud and move me to tears without being cheesy or overdramatic for a second everyone i have shown firefly to has loved it young or old male or female the show is set years in the future but this is not the sterile future so often portrayed it has a very human and realistic feel that makes you think this is really what it might be like down the line technological advances and political changes have taken place but human society is very much the same it takes place partly in outer space and on multiple planets but there are no aliens the music on the show is unusual and grounds it as an almost down to earth story rather than your typical sci fi fare i always fast forward the title credits and theme song on tv shows but with firefly i listen to the song and watch the beautifully done credits every time there are main characters in the show and by the time you are halfway through the series they will become your second family the cast has such incredible chemistry and the writing is so good that its impossible not to care about them deeply look at it this way for a tv show that was cancelled in the middle of its first season to not only be amazons best seller but to have gotten a major motion picture released based on it it must be something pretty incredible it is 
ive read reviewers saying if you have a low iq or are a redneck this is for you hmm my wife and i both have healthy iqs and we both enjoyed it i found firefly to be wickedly entertaining i do like the quirky stuff northern exposure early x files west wing battlestar galactica so im not going to insult the folks that dont like it ill just disagree yeah sure its not realistic even given the setting but name me a show worth much thats totally realistic i found the characters to be interesting and fun and i enjoyed the mysteries and the odd ball sense of humour 
it is no surprise that this series about space cowboys and space cowgirls has such a following because it is truly fantastic despite being so short lived this show had everything quirky but likable characters several interesting plots and backstories a rather terrifying enemy that plagues the stars reavers amazing costumes especially inaras a sense of humor awesome cast adventure romance clever writing with funny one liners a ton of potential gumption grit on and on and on i cling to my fourteen episodes on dvd as well as the movie 
in between missions or before bed i like to pop an episode in of firefly here in afghanistan ive seen it times but still i miss lines and see new things in the background i dont know were joss whedon came up with some of the lines but they are hilarious and very rememorable great show and worth stars no doubt i dont use the blu ray stuff but looks great in hd if you havent seen this yet and can pick up the season for bucks or less like i did youll get your moneys worth you know what else is funny is this is one of the few sci fi shows i can get my wife to watch 
one of the best scifi shows ever made and they cancelled it that quick whoever had that idea and or made that decision robbed us all of a series that should have ran no less than seasons firefly is superb in every regard great acting good camerawork nice fx well written storyline etc etc this series is worth double the asking price in my humble opinion also the musical theme for ff is top notch 
i never watched it when it was on tv since it was bounced around so much i only just now started watching it when a friend lent me one of the dvds i am a big fan of deep space and it has taken a long time to find a new show that has drawn me in as much as ds did this show is a refreshing change to scifi tv everytime i anticipate a star trek ending i dont receive one which is good it makes the show harder to predict reasons i like the show so much it has great character development the actors seem to really synch well with each other and their backstory is actually interesting i have always enjoyed video games from the space privateer genre this show depicts that just right i wish more modern video games like freelancer had more of this feel i like the off world sets they feel like something out of blade runner every environment seems to make you want to go out and explore it 
i had never heard of this show until i stumbled across it on amazon instant video prime i was so riveted i watched every single episode i am stunned this show only lasted one season a real shame there is an amazing bond between all the characters that makes this show believable and irresistible you just want to watch and learn more about them and their relationships the basic plot of this futuristic show is that humans have moved to a new solar system after burning out the earth it starts when the alliance has defeated the independents and taken control of the solar system under one rule law the captain of the ship firefly was an independent fighter and sought refuge and a form of freedom in a smuggling ship he bought each character is likable and endearing despite their faults and i cant stress how well they all work together a rare and unique chemistry in a few of the episodes the writing is not awesome but the acting and characters still make it worth watching 
ill admit i didnt catch this series the first time around in fact i saw a preview of it that fox managed rarely to air and was completely turned off and then sometime about a year or so after it went off air i heard about how good firefly was and a friend told me that if i liked farscape i loved farscape that i would love firefly and he was right it has everything i love scifi action world building unique and interesting characters especially river and mal relationships that intrique mal and inara and kaylee and simon and adventure enough to keep me reeling for weeks i fell for the series just about from serenity i knew not to watch from the order of the way fox aired the episodes and in my estimation that asinine decision is a major contribution to the reason the series failed its not that it sucked in fact its the exact opposite fox has rarely been able to properly market a scifi show x files is the only exception and even then it was more a fluke than anything else fox didnt market that show very well at first like firefly it caught on by word of mouth firefly is an amazing cult hit and spawned a fan successful movie serenity i already own the dvds for firefly but ill be purchasing the blu ray edition not only for the better video and audio but also for those extras that werent on the dvd set 
what more is there to say the combination of scripts production direction cast and fx are the best ive ever seen on a tv series not just fans of joss or sci fi but anyone with an eye for quality should love this show 
i never knew about this show until i mentioned to my son i was going to see serenity in the theater he told me it was based on the firefly series i cant figure out how i missed it i love scifi and watch fox shows often marketing missed the boat i liked serenity so much that i got all firefly discs from netflix wow how could they think of cancelling this series its intelligent rich in characters and locations laugh out loud clever and im sooo hooked i am buying the collection today bring it back 
my husband has copies of this series one for home one for the dvd folder and one he normally keeps with him for when he is away from home he is soooo totally a browncoat and loves this series well worth the buy such a shame they cancelled this series early 
this show has an amazing ability to pull you in to pull you in to the story to make you want more and more this like the also great x files is not stand alone episodes tie into each other something that i like bring it back to tv 
i bought this dvd collection on a whimsy i could not find anything else i wanted and i couldnt stomach punky brewster i had never even seen this series so i looked at the packaging nice i read the excerpts interesting i dropped the thirty five bucks then i watched it episode one left me feeling bleh by the end of episode i began to realise i was watching one of the most enthralling television series i had ever watched never had i been so glued to any television program since v the miniseries or stephen kings the stand and that is exactly what this plays out like a powerfully orchestrated high budget mini series the continuing story line is compelling even downright memorable i had honest and loud physical and verbal reactions while watching this that is how perfectly they fleshed out these characters i feel i now know them and i am not happy they are gone shame on you fox you shouldve tried harder dont you realize that this has a true future dump the reality shows you idiots and get this back on the air a mix of western a little star trek even romance and spelunking what an incredible ride it has been watching this set i only wish there could be a second one buy this set and show the moronic tv execs what real entertainment is 
firefly is the pilot series that preceeds the movieserenity widescreen edition aired on fox in it only lasted for eleven of the fourteen produced episodes has been polled the worlds best space sci fi ever storyline revolves around the characters who are spacefaring cowboys come pirates trying to make a living in a harsh universe controlled by a militistic corp the alliance most people who have watched firefly comment if only i had the money to bring this series back 
love this show i never get sick of watching it the blu ray edition is soo much more vivid than the dvd set i recommend any fan of this show to buy it buy it from amazon the turnaround on my order was great thanks 
this is one of those rare series that has kept me awake until am nightly viewing it rarely in decades have i seen such a warm thoughtful and expertly cast series as that which josh whedon has assembled in firefly it is true that once you have seen the first several segments youre hooked the interviews that accompany the th dvd can easily lead someone to become wet eyed when it is learned that the network who should not remain unnamed but will tried in classic hollywood fashion to change something totally developed and functional into just another piece of viewing wasteland fortunately whedon did not give in but the loss of the series is a genuine tragedy the cast is incredible as an ensemble and reflects the genuine care and friendship that they have for one another as disclosed in the accompanying interviews on the th dvd it has a lot of the same feel as quot west wing quot in this area this dvd set is a prized addition to my film and television library there are few series that i would pay to see resurrected but this is one of those it would be a perfect fit for the sci fi channel mr whedon are you listening 
had to get it after watching castle the tv series it has been fun to watch a combination of star trek and bonanza 
i am totally new to firefly and must say this is an excellent series great stories with great character development excellent production values well directed photographed scripted and scored the sets are beautifully detailed adding realism to the stories plus it looks and sounds fabulous on blu ray im glad i bought this set it bears repeated viewing engrossing and entertaining expect the unexpected most highly recommended 
firefly was one of the most entertaining tv series of the past few decades no doubt some will compare it to startrek however all of the versions of startrek pale in comparison to firefly fireflys characters are intriguing and diverse the show is loaded with hints and potential for incredible development of several plots the dvd release of the first season will be the first tv series i will purchase on dvd and it is certainly something ive been looking forward to since the show was cancelled the fact that firefly was cancelled is a mystery that may baffle many of us forever certainly whomever made that decision had no concept of the quality or long term potential of this show the only thing firefly lacks is marketing 
series creator joss whedon had the superb idea of literally taking the wagon train to the stars concept space opera best exemplified by the original star trek by creating this mesmerizing western science fiction television series firefly which had too short a season meddlesome network television executives fox in this case forced whedon to air the series episodes not in the order they should have been aired with the result that the final episode ever shown on the fox network was the two hour pilot serenity firefly is the saga of the crew of the firefly class starship serenity trying to keep themselves one light jump ahead of the totalitarian alliance of planets willing to do any job legal or otherwise to keep themselves alive whedon created an intriguing cast of characters as the serenitys crew and passengers thankfully they may now find themselves a new cinematic lease on life in serenity the forthcoming film adaptation of this series judging from the handful of episodes i saw firefly had the potential of becoming as fine a classic example of televised space opera science fiction as babylon 
firefly is amazing entertainment it takes the sci fi genre and gives it a good swift kick in the rump its a show that relies on character development instead of technobabble and plot rather than special effects although the special effects are pretty good for a tv show its a little unconventional with the western sci fi mix but it also adds unmeasurable charm and believability the characters seem pretty generic at first but by the end of the hour premier their personalities come out by the end of the third episode mal and the gang feel like old friends there are no aliens no transporters no laser pistols but there is witty and clever dialog suspense laughs and great writing like most people i never heard of firefly until it was off the air there is no way this show would have failed if it had been properly promoted by fox look at all the star reviews id give it stars if i could its just that good 
its hard to understand why a series like quot firefly quot is still not on the air but thank goodness for dvd now the world can watch all the episodes of this very satisfying series without the mindless pressure of quot ratings quot and lowest common denominator appeal to dilute what is a very thoughtful and well produced show each character is well drawn well acted and the series mythology is deep and resonant with attributes of pop culture excepting the ususal science fiction cliches there are no aliens on quot firefly quot but there are wonderful values that i find perfect from the first frame to the last 
at the time of my review there had been customer reviews of these there were one star two star three star four star and five star reviews i know that you cant please everybody but its obvious how people feel about this show and i have to vote with the majority this show is outstanding 
this series should have been continued what a romp into space with some funny quirky characters certainly better than the drivel on the tube now follow the group as they take the firefly into space for adventures i love this series 
when i introduce sci fi to someone who doesnt like sci fi i show them this tv series to show whatsci fi can and should be they are always impressed and open to seeing more 
okay i have to get this out of the way first off the series is incomplete the show was scheduled to run for seasons and only made it through one run out of order and only partly aired by fox before the network shut it down after the dvd ends you will still have a lot of questions about some of plot and the characters particularly river and shepard book also although originally billed as an action show firefly combines that with a drama its as if you bought a video game expecting mortal kombat and got final fantasy the action although not constant is there but so is a lot of intricate plot which depending on your tastes can be good or bad with that said firefly gets off to a fairly slow start but when it finds its groove depending on who you talk to episodes in it really takes off the ensemble works extremely well together and the characters while somewhat archetypal are endearing and easily related to the effects are pretty good and the plots are believable and well thought out i especially like the creative camera use which did many shots off center or with flare the commentaries and special features are nice touches but the real gem of the dvd is the show itself sometimes really good shows dont make it this is an example of one and for all its unfulfilled questions it is one of the greatest sci fi series ever 
the best show ever joss whedons masterpiece cancelling this show was the biggest tragedy in tv lineup history there will never be another like it 
i watched this show as much as i could when it first aired but wasnt and i still dont watch a lot of tv because of the rest of the junk thats on i remember seeing some episodes and wondering what was going on especially when they finally aired the pilot later it was confusing now i find out it was presented all out of order i thought the show had potential but was just ok then i saw the boxed set in the store and said to myself quot what the hell im in a good mood today quot i dont like to spend money on a whim but i plunked down the dough anyway and brought it home after watching about half the episodes i can honestly say this was a pretty good show im not a fan of joss wheadon i never once saw buffy or angel but this show attracted me the episode he wrote so far seems to have the most clever dialogue hey its the guy from quot two guys and a girl quot anyway i will go see the movie when it comes out favorite effect the reaver ship following serenity through the sky while smoke and flames are spewing out the back way cool looked like a giant oil fire 
yet another great show thatshould not have been cancelled but i contributed to its death and for that i apologize 
ill only say this quickly since its already been said over and over again in these reviews this series has great characters and crackling good stories and for those reasons alone are worth your time and money but i also want to emphasize the fact that these shows have some of the most amazing and ambitious action scenes in recent memory and that includes comparisons to stuff you pay to see in the movies joss whedon doesnt settle for clean space battles with a few laser effects no we get dramatic and extended chase scenes in the atmosphere of planets with the terrain and clouds flying by characters climbing around on the outside of the ship again while the ship is in the atmosphere with the wind whipping our heroes about and all manner of cityscapes spaceports and landing pads details action and effects certainly arent the most important elements of a good science fiction show great characters and great stories are but one should be aware that this show delivers the important things and isnt stingy with the thrills effects and quot wow quot factor buy this now 
firefly is not your typical sci fi series firstly there are no aliens it envisions a future where there may in fact be nonhuman life but we havent found it yet secondly the world is considerably seamier than the airbrushed idyllic utopias so often seen in science fiction shows all of the main characters are outcasts of some sort or other they live on the edge and theyre proud of the independence it gives them thirdly it comes from the mind of joss whedon the man behind buffy the vampire slayer and angel as you might expect that means moral dilemmas witty snarky dialogue and a show thats never afraid to get emotionally heavy as long as yknow its okay to be witty and snarky about it the titular firefly is a ship serenity owned by survivor of the war of independence the losing side mal reynolds nathan fillion along with his former subordinate and current first mate zoe gina torres he skulks through space trying to avoid the everpresent alliance along the way hes picked up quite a few fellow misfits wash alan tudyk zoes husband and the pilot of serenity jayne adam baldwin a not too bright mercenary with an eye for the main chance kaylee jewel staite the ships perky mechanic book ron glass a preacher who seems to know an awful lot about guns and the alliance and inara morena baccarin high class prostitute and the only vestige of respectability serenity has the story begins when two more runaways find their way onboard serenity simon tam sean maher and his sister river summer glau theyre both on the run from the alliance who performed nefarious experiments on river that left her insane but with certain mysterious skills that soon become apparent with their arrival and the discovery that theres very little the alliance wont do to get river back the story is thrown into motion the show is top notch in just about every aspect character dialogue acting music special effects and quite likely should have done well however it was broadcast by fox which is infamous for boneheaded programming decisions in fireflys case they started with the second episode and ended with the first episode showed almost every episode in between out of order constantly pre empted it and rescheduled it and were all too ready to can it firefly was dead with a run of glorious episodes or was it sales of this very dvd boxed set showed that there was indeed an audience for firefly and as of this writing universal studios has released a feature film continuation called serenity written and directed by whedon and it has reached at the box office this may lead to a sequel or sequels i certainly hope so or it may not but either way weve had hours of quality writing and acting thanks to joss whedon and i thank him for that i highly recommend this dvd boxed set to anyone period 
i remember when firefly originally aired on fox and i remember thinking the idea of a space western sounded stupid and not very interesting when it was later canceled i was not surprised when firefly was later released on dvd i heard nothing but praise for this show and how great it was i admit my curiosity was peaked but i still was not ready to give it a try then i heard rumblings that there was a movie in the works based on the show that along with many of my friends telling me to buy this was enough for me to give it shot i watched this whole boxest over the period of two days i was shocked at how good this show was and i was also angry with myself for never giving this show a chance back when it originally aired on television but then i realized that i wasnt the only one and now there are thousands of us who have just now discovered this great show on dvd this show is unlike anything i have ever seen on television and it works also it was one of the first sci fi programs i had ever seen that remembered that in space there is no sound so during the battles in space you hear nothing and i love that i really enjoyed all of the characters and looked forward to each episode and what would happen to them next also after the first few episodes i found myself singing along with the theme song and still do every once and awhile but all good things must come to an end and i was disappointed when i had finished the set knowing that there would be no more episodes but as i mentioned there is a film that will be released later this year and i cannot wait i think anyone who is on the fence about this show should take a chance as i did and buy this set and if you dont want to buy it rent it or borrow it from a friend and i am sure you will end up buying a copy of your own before long this show is that good and joss whedon has proven he is one of the best 
firefly really didnt do it for me right away but after the first few episodes and the characters started to flesh out they really grew on me all of the characters on serenity turn out to be interesting and a lot of fun to watch the episodes just got better and better for me as it rocketed towards its premature demise as everyones said before it really is a shame that it didnt get a chance to go any further in this format because finding out about the true story over the course of several seasons would have been a joy to watch i just hope somebody like scifi will pony up and bring it back if battlestar can be so good on scifi why cant firefly the funny thing is i really dont like most science fiction out there 
firefly is a diamond in the rough a hidden gem the beautiful moon behind the clouds of a stormy night once you have discovered this beauty it will not let you go straight up the characters and the story of firefly will suck you in this show is set in a sci fi future world but thats not what its about so you sci fi geeks come to firefly while at the same time if you are scared about a sci fi show dont be its about the people and their relationships with each other and their journey in life which so happens to be in space on the same ship you will laugh you will be on the edge or your seat you will hurt when they hurt it takes a really good story that is done really well with really good actors that play really good characters to get me to like a show but when it does man its magic and thats what firefly has done by far my favorite show now i will do whatever it takes if it is ever possible to bring firefly back this is how to tell a story through a live action show 
plainly put this is one of the genres greatest works i have watched the entire series with my girlfriend at least five times and have watched it without her at least a couple more needless to say i am in love with the perfectly matched cast directing and writing when prompted in the past the best concise description i can muster for firefly is cowboys in space but it is so much more i quickly fell in love with the individual characters the reality of living in space is made believable by the shows great writing there is a lot of great action and throughout the show maintains levity with very well placed laughs if you are a fan of the genre whedons work or are just curious about all of the highly positive reviews i would highly suggest doing yourself the favor of treating yourself to this set everyone who i have lent my set to or watched episodes with has ended up buying their own copies to watch and share 
when i heard about joss starting a new series i was really excited i loved buffy and angel and was looking forward to the new one i watched the first one and thought it was good then the second one which i thought was okay by the third one i had given it up and then it got cancelled i thought okay no great loss wrong last weekend i got to see the dvd boxed edition and was hooked this series needs to be seen in order with pilot i immediately sent for the box set and am eagerly looking forward to seeing it again get the box set it is worth it
my college son couldnt stop talking about this series so i bought it and now am hooked i bought serenity the movie based on this series there are no more episodes available and i cant understand why one of the tv networks didnt pick this up and run with it 
so here i am again finding a show long after cancelled i did see serenity in the theatre but had no idea it was made from a tv show i realized later on that firefly was the original production and serenity was the movie so this show was brief and wrongly cancelled it was simply amazing a great and original story mixing the cowboy with the space quest the character development is awesome and no character is one thing each has back stories and personalities that are not derived from one action or event the stories are great the mix of action drama humor and suspense are wonderful so we are rewarded from fox with not even a full season thanks fox once again you screwed us all it seems like i find these shows too late i came into farscape after cancellation and the same with firefly the thing is i barely knew either were ever on and i watch a bunch of tv i have to blame marketing for both if you do not let people know what is on your channels how are people supposed to tune it to watch 
a series cut short by network stupidity and short sightedness now comes to dvd with everything you could ask for in a show and more even if youve never seen an episode of the show pick up this very affordable box set trust me youll be glad you did with the one exception being that it leaves you begging for more find out what all the excitement is about and why fans worldwide are clamoring for more i guaranty you will be one if you give it a try theres no power in the verse that cane stop us bring on the movie i cant wait 
i think the only reason that this show was cancelled was because of awful promotion i had no idea that it was on when it was the only way i knew about this show was from friends saying that the creator of buffy made a tv show called firefly and how they bought the dvds and loved them i love joss whedon so i bought these dvds without knowing anything about the show from the name i actually thought it was going to be about nature but i am glad i bought the dvds because this show is incredible i am so glad that they are making a movie based on the show it will be amazing the trailer is so cool 
i started watching the series firefly on netflex and got hooked on it at a friends house i couldnt watch all the episodes so i bought the whole intire series and i love it the series was way beyone its time and should not have ever left joss whedon has a great imagination i am so sadden to have seen it come and go so quickly this series should have stayed on for years to come it was just getting started to where it needed to be and boom just like that it was gone i loved each of the characters played in this series i did get to see jewel stait in the stargate atlantis series as the new doctor i watched that series from begining to the end she is a great actress as all of them were im sorry to have just caught this series way too late 
the world is divided into people who get firefly and people who dont in this series joss whedon created one of the most realistic post war visions of the future ever committed to tape that at the same time spoke about yesterday and today maybe a little too much today for its own good the series is anti corporate anti government and while it takes the stand that some things are worth fighting for it is largely anti war no wonder fox did everything in its power to kill it off including airing episodes out of order skipping weeks after airing only three eps and inevitably canceling the show without even airing episodes and out of this was particularly damaging as firefly had a greater sense of ongoing plot than any other whedon series in its first year viewers were left wondering on more than one occasion when a character would reference something we hadnt seen yet the backstage dramatics aside firefly is intelligent and like buffy mythic except this time whedon is dealing with the myth of america the frontier the civil war the rise of the corporation etc firefly is a demanding show it asks its audience to appreciate the shades of grey in its characters moral scale the villains are not comfortingly dressed as an alien race in years mankind will still be its own worst enemy technology will be in the hands of a privileged few and others will in the black whedons frontier third world where it is possible to exist without the interference or benefit of civilization and government things will be dirty and used firefly creates a universe that almost totally opposes that of that bastion of television sci fi star trek its federation like central power the alliance is interpreted as being oppressive and dystopic we are on the side of those who resisted like the maqui and lost the acting is strong the writing as excellent funny and moving as on any whedon show and the effects and sets create a consistent believable world it is a shame the series didnt have a more hospitable environment in which to grow and become all it could have been 
joss whedon creator of buffy the vampire slayer and angel did it again but unfortunately on a network that didnt appreciate his storytelling dismissed by fox and casual viewers as a space western this thoughtful look at humanity years in the future was presented out of order and incomplete by the network that commissioned and then cancelled it years from now humanity has terraformed and spread to other planets in our galaxy unfortunately for the colonists they are given the bare necessities to survive thus is born the framework of a western years in the future throw in a recent battle between those who wish to stay free and those who want a centralized overpowering government and you have the makings of a truly compelling saga thankfully we can see firefly all of its episodes and in order before the release of serenity in september on this wonderful dvd set 
over two thousand reviews im still going to put my two cents worth into the mix about my big damn heroes we all pretty much know the back story but ill keep it quick for any new fans who might be perusing this review area firefly was a short lived science fiction tv series that got knocked out of the box way before its time in the aftermath a legion of loyal fans thats browncoats to you civilians and smile when you say it partner rose up to the challenge to keep the series alive this dvd collects the episodes that comprised the tv series general spoilers firefly at its core entertainment value follows the adventures of a rag tag crew of mercenary adventurers under the command of captain mal reynolds a former sergeant in the independents some years back a civil war erupted between the alliance who wanted to incorporate all the planetary colonies under one flag and the independents folks along the outer colony planets who werent very happy with that option the short version is the independents lost zoom forward a few years and you have displaced former soldiers such as mal and his former squad mate and now first mate zoe who are now seeking out a means of survival the code is simple find a crew find a job keep flying along the way mal and zoe gather a rather interesting sort of crew hoban wash washburn the slightly off kilter ace pilot married to zoe the couple embodies the whole opposites attract thing jayne cobb a mercenary for hire whod just as soon shoot you in the leg in exchange for some moola yet has some good in him and that thick head of his kaylee frye sweetheart of the universe and a dang fine mechanic that can coax the firefly class bucket that they all zoom around in to keep on flying the above characters were already on board at the start of the series the firefly series proper actually picks up at the point in time where reynolds takes on three passengers doctor simon tam shepherd booke and river tam simons slightly mentally impaired sister tam is a deposed doctor who is on the run with his sister booke is a preacher by trade but not much is known about his past river is eccentric yet reynolds needs paying fares and hed never admit it but a good heart and takes on the passengers the alliance is ever present and the commanders of the organization continue to govern another threat out in the black of space is the reavers men now gone deformed sick with rage and cannibalistic that prey on travelers i love the firefly concept a space western with some american civil war overtones and asian language and design thrown in for good measure you have this crew that zips around in a firefly class jack of all trades science fiction transport ship called serenity named after the decisive and heartbreaking final battle that saw the end to the war yet mal walks around wearing a six gun holstered low on his hip a long brown duster coat from his sergeant days and where the browncoat moniker comes from describing the men and women who fought against the alliance and occasionally spouting off in asian type slang the series is a gritty look at science fiction no aliens here everyone is human the ports that serenity pulls into can range from buzzing metro to down and dirty frontier planets my personal favorites though all of the installments are good of the episodes are ariel and out of gas there is no such thing as an easy way to live and the crew takes on what jobs they can to survive even if the job is illegal borderline illegal on the level or somewhere in between all of that the dvd collection is comprised of episodes if you like good science fiction a good western and some space adventure bolstered by an ensemble cast do yourself a favor and purchase a copy of the dvd so you can check out a cancelled tv show that deserved so much better cant stop the signal 
scifi western who would ever guess that this would be the best scifi show ever best stories best ensemble cast best writing my regret is that i didnt discover it until after the shows cancellation i would have watched this show forever this was only one season long but it still contained some of the best lines ever conceived i would have recommend this to everyone brown coats unite 
i have been meaning to write a review of firefly for a long time to this day i regret losing this wonderful series in its infancy i was one of those people who didnt watch it when it was on but found it a couple of years later this true gem with its eclectic cast of talented people brought to us by joss whedon as noted by the thousands who have reviewed it here and reviewed it recently has probably become the standard for almost perfect sci fi nathan fillion now known as richard castle will never eclipse his role as mal reynolds captain of his spit and duct taped spaceship serenity the rest of the crew already named here probably a thousand times can thank firefly for their still huge popularity and success today those of us who love firefly do so with great passion and loyalty what exactly defines the wonderful series as what has become not just a cult series but also simply a fan favorite is the magic this cast and crew weaved in each episode it was far ahead of its time with stories so varied smart and many times very funny they can be watched again and again and one never tires of it i still find it hard to believe this series was cancelled after only episodes and the movie serenity did not wow the box office as it should have that is on we the people for not showing up and supporting it when it was needed the most as for should you the few people who have not seen it yet should you get it and watch it a resounding yes im sure its not for everyone but if you like smart sweet excellent entertainment it doesnt hurt to give it a chance while the series episodes are stand alone and the movie serenity does tie it up i suspect you will join the ranks of the rest of us who wish the network had made a bolder decision and stuck with it like ncis today which began around the time firefly was on it would have built its audience and those of us who miss it dearly would have many more episodes to watch over and over again i join the many voices here and tell you to buy this wonderful once in a lifetime series and envy you that you get to watch it for the first time very very highly recommended
i love firefly and bought this one day on a whim im glad i did this is a great series and im glad to now own it 
i was so disappointed when firefly was cancelled and absolutely overjoyed when i learned they were releasing the entire series on dvd including episodes i had never seen i bought the box set just a few days ago and have already watched all episodes this series has everything an interesting plot fascinating three dimensional characters and a fantastic setting fox made a big mistake when they cancelled it i dont know why they didnt give it a better chance to succeed it was mishandled from the very beginning i wont go into the details but fox basically shot themselves in the foot here anyway i would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys character development humor drama romance action adventure etc theres only one downside after watching all the episodes offered youre left wanting more each character has a mystery in their past and none are solved in this box set which is maddening i admit but whats there is so good its worth the aggravation of being left hanging and ive heard distant rumors that a firefly movie may be in the works 
several years after this aired i finally got around to watching the series on netflix ill be totally honest i made two attempts at this series attempt watched the first minutes of episode it reminded me too much of terminator and didnt seem like a show i could watch i stopped the episode and moved on to something else attempt several months later im not sure what possessed me to try again but i gave it another shot after making it through the rough scenes of the first episode i emerged on the other side and didnt look back it has the shadowrun sega genesis type plot line that i really enjoy the characters are quirky the story lines interesting and i couldnt wait to tag along for the next adventure of the serenity the final episode seemed out of place with the others but maybe they knew things were being shut down and decided to try and wrap things up differently my only real complaint with the show is the opening song the guitar is fine but the lyrics are extremely basic they definitely should have devoted more time to it than i hope they did a great short lived series that was cancelled way too soon maybe some time they will bring this gem back but i wont hold my breath waiting for that to happen 
whoa where did this series come from and how come i never heard of it and why in the world isnt it still on television well ive heard of it now and whats more ill never forget firefly because im going to dust off the dvds every once in a while and revisit this bunch of great and ultimately loveable misfits 
i never did see the show on tv i bought the dvd set some time after it came out as a present for someone else who as it turned out already had it and so i kept it thinking to watch the series someday since people seem to have liked it and there it sat for about a year finally i sat down one late evening i was bored and thought why not finally take a look after staying up til am watching the whole first disc i thought to myself my girlfriend has to see this it combined elements of all the things she loved comedy romance and wit into an amazing package with amazing actors sure enough she loved it just as much as i and over the course of the week we consumed everything we could from the dvds now there could not be two more avid serenity fans we eagerly await the movie and even plan to post some posters for the movie around town and are trying to get as many people as we can to see the dvd all this for a show i never even saw on the air or even cared about until i found it years later on dvd nothing else has inspired me quite like firefly 
i never knew about this show until i saw the movie serenity and now that i have seen the entire series from the dvd release all i can say is how shocked i was that fox would want to cancel a show like this if they brought family guy back from cancellation why not firefly 
it is a mistake to say that firefly is new or revolutionary since its key ideas have been print sf staples for decades what firefly is is ambitious and audience centered in a way little tv sci fi has been since the original star trek it anticipates a smart audience and rewards them with humane high octane stories about clever characters in sophisticated situations so naturally it got cancelled dare i say that the best thing about firefly is that its incomplete only fourteen episodes were made introducing a story lush with promise and an energetic ensemble immersed in the kind of work that most actors long for it is this promise unsullied by later network interference which i think makes this the best tv to hit dvd in years beyond the writing acting and direction all of which are superb this show has some of the best visual design ive seen in decades joss whedon studied how space flight takes place even now and reflected the cramped quarters austere living conditions and blue collar immediacy missing from more slick productions firefly is the latest true embodiment of george lucas vision of used space firefly didnt find its audience until it was out on dvd but its clear why this story inspires comic books a feature film fan fiction and a massive fan culture despite its brief span for true believers in tv as art this show sums up the promise that the medium rarely accomplishes fun funny and energetic there is no question why a cancelled show commands fan loyalty even several years later 
i bought this series based on all the raving reviews here i had never heard of it before my husband and i watched an episode a night and we both got so into this show very well made great characters i miss it i bet well rewatch the series in a year or so and enjoy it again too bad so many good shows like this and freaks and geeks get cancelled after a season or less 
i was so inspired by this terrific show and the subsequent movie that i had to write something consider the following an homage to the shows philosophical core warning contains spoilers mercymal has just knocked the huge man with the blade into the ships engine he pays for it later by being tortured by a man with no mercy mal decides to protect river tam after casting her and her brother aside she lies helpless on the ground it is his moment to walk away he picks her up and takes a step which will end the lives of two of his crew and yet he finds mercy for her in that moment standing above the disabled operative mal turns on the recording that has finally freed river tam and its truth stands as a final blow against the perfectionist alliance and its failed rulers mal takes mercy on the man and decides not to kill him while the young girl he took mercy on is saving the lives of his crew she cuts down the reavers who are in the state they are in for no fault of their own they are wild and crazed and innocent and receiving the mercy killing which is their only release and in the end the mercy shown to the operative comes back and again saves the lives of his crew it is not an easy lesson for mercy on one has consequences for others and it is never easy for mal to know when to show mercy but he does mercy to live mercy to die mercy to his crew to push the man begging him for mercy away from the mule mercy to the same man to kill him when in the hands of the reavers each moment while being the captain of his crew he must choose and that is his razors edge 
i completely missed firefly when it was on tv thats not surprising since network television rarely draws me in these days so when a friend invited me over to watch the firefly dvds i had no idea what to expect it was joss whedons reputation and my enjoyment of his previous shows that drew me firefly is a space opera of sorts taking place in a western as in cowboys themed universe where many earth cultures have blended together characters lapse into chinese when cursing there is a school of thought among sf fandom that when a show has to resort to the cowboy episode as the original battlestar galactica series did in the first season the writers are truly lost for ideas i had mixed feelings about the shows merits until i got into it a bit if i were to take firefly too seriously i think its a show id probably detest but minutes of viewing convinced me that joss whedon had a sense of humor about him when conceiving and executing this short lived series the firefly universe is a universe populated by rogue space cowboys escorts religious fanatics and a somewhat under explained political struggle loosely mirroring star wars the empire and rebellion theres irony everywhere some truly cheesy writing and acting and some great special effects while i enjoyed the campiness of the show id hate to leave the reader with the impression that the sometimes over the top humor is the only reason to watch there are some truly superlative moments running the gamut from tense to heart breaking the interlaced humor serves not only the audience in making the show more enjoyable but the character development as well overall firefly is probably one of the best sf shows ive ever seen take any aspect of the show and drop it into another reference frame and one would run for cover somehow whedon manages to pull all of these strange odds and ends together into a cohesive unit that is really entertaining aside from the episodes the extras on the dvd including the gag reel are well worth viewing though truth be told i could probably go a lifetime without hearing the theme song again while it helps to watch the episodes in order once the characters are explained each episode is great for stand alone viewing firefly could probably have lasted a couple more seasons before deteriorating and i wish it had 
why why why why did fox cancel this show and when when when will the absolutely deserved popularity of the dvd boxed set prompt someone in tv land to re engage and continue this saga how much does it take to show that there is an audience a huge devoted audience for josh whedons genius writing and the loving performances by the cast i want more 
a dvd set which does justice to one of the best albeit shortest lived television series top rate stories acting and special effects in a quirky intelligent and very exciting western sci fi seriously one the great tragedies of television history was the premature cancellation of this series the dvd is packed with extras and gorgeous to behold especially in a wide screen format it comes a small consolation but at least fox gave us a quality dvd set 
this show deserved to be a modern scifi classic up there with babylon and farscape as a real alternative to star trek firefly is an odd mixture of traditional spaceship show and a western all mixed in with bits of asian culture which was actually a nice touch i think that this show was put on air out of order without even the pilot episode being shown till the end of the series was a tragedy when viewed in the right sequence as shown in the box set we have a wonderful and quite unique tv series with some great special effects thrown in i got to the last episode and swore at the tv because there was no more to watch and cursed the stupidity of tv executives again my only gripe with this box set of the show is that it is hard to find the episode commentries which are buried inside the quot language quot selection section for each episode 
joss whedons universe is gloriously fresh and beautifully flawed he paints the aftermath of the war of unification with bright strokes showing the richness of the alliance planets and their mutual success support and military might as well as the can do independent spirit of the rim worlds who struggle daily with the little they have with an entire galaxy to play with theres plenty of room for individual stories to portray the clashes that arise in such a widely variant setting and our guides on that journey all have their own stories to tell along the way on the smaller scale some of the main characters aboard the serenity have taken sides on the war issue along with all its sub issues such as what jobs theyre okay taking part in and some havent creating a delightful mix of viewpoints on the everyday workings of the spacecraft and how to get by and no one is inflexible all the characters grow and change over the course of the series organically adapting as we all do to new situations love fear loyalty friendship greed its all in there the episodes take us to a vast range of locations some poor smarmy struggling and backstabbing and some rich and flush with the new technology and all that it entails captain reynolds and his crew generally know what to expect in the former but they know they must be constantly aware of shifting alliances and unseen trouble in the latter as well basically its true what the character zoe says about the captain the war never ended for him he has to fight every day for his ship and his crew against everyone that survived the war he fought in but hes clever and hes got a resourceful band of allies and they do the best they can to keep flying the dialogue in this series fascinates me the words and phrases it uses whether borrowed from mandarin the other surviving language from old earth or whether patched together in space western style clearly help to define the feel of the show itself as a proud browncoat i can always identify other browncoats by the way they talk about this series and of course by the fact that they cant shut up about it 
this was the best series ever not to get renewed for a second season and blows of the series out there that lasted more than one season out of the water just look at nathan fillions popularity with castle and you will see why they made a big mistake with firefly this should have easily been a season hit 
firefly was one of my favorite sci fi shows to ever air there weve got that out of the way the show itself had its flaws no question the standard romantic subplots were not only predictable but sometimes horrifying to watch sean mahers simon talking to jewel staites kaylee for example the tired remington steele scully mulder in love but in denial sequence has been played to death well before now and took some more hits in this series ron glass as shephard book was denied some decent lines given some great ones and often forced to play the relatively unconvincing role of one who brings inappropriate morality to the forefront it was grating sometimes to see such obviously weak characterization forced into play those were some of its weaknesses and they were glaring but the show drew me in despite these flaws the interactions between crew members especially the moments of normal life were compelling this cast obviously enjoyed working together and the writing for them was typical of josss style realistic conversations between real people first sci fi show ive seen where ships in space make no sound gunshot wounds bleed and continue bleeding people especially malcolm reynolds make hard choices and ethics in a hard life arent as clear cut as weve been told to believe the surprising humor of this show which was a mixture of great interactive writing and excellent deliveries from the cast was a true treat to see essentially and i suppose i could have summarized it earlier firefly was truly a space western exploring the lives of gritty anti heroes nasty villians and hardships both personal and environmental in an action packed way it was not realistic but it wasnt supposed to be it was supposed to be a saga of anti heroes a couple of rebels a treacherous lunk two felons and a ship built for smuggling and what they did in the worlds around them both good and bad for what it was supposed to be firefly performed exceptionally well even my bride to be who hates westerns found herself involved in the show and wanting to see what happened next that firefly was given a bad air time weak advertising inconsistent scheduling and eventually cancelled is not at all related to how well crafted the product was if you liked the spaghetti westerns batman the movie and or alien resurrection youll want to see this show if you watched the series already then i doubt anything will keep you from getting the set 
walking out of the movie serenity i remarked to a friend of mine that i was really impressed and hoped theyd make a sequel a day later he loaned me the dvds for the television show about an hour and a half later i bought the boxed set for myself its become one of my all time favorites yet i dont even remember it being advertised back when it originally aired im truly impressed and that is no easy feat since i typically read books for entertainment and even mediocre speculative fiction books usually blow the socks off of even the best television and movie productions of that genre there are thousands of reviews already published on this site so you probably have the plot down pat ill add that its much like babylon good acting occasionally even great acting a believable universe intricate plots and truly original scripts all wrapped into a very creative totally fun package if you liked the movie and have not already seen the series youve got to get a hold of a copy its fantastic entertainment very highly recommended 
i bought this dvd based off the other rave reviews i was not disappointed it has a little bit of everything i love it i would highly recommend purchasing this 
a friend of mine knew i liked tv shows which were different and he recommended firefly it was a great show that ended too early every episode i grew to like the characters more and more the crew of the serenity was a group of very unique personalities and you grew to accept them as part of your family you not only like these people you learn to care about who they are and how they came to be on serenity captain reynolds kept you smiling with his laid back ways yet he had a heart of gold his humor and compassion reminded me of a cross between hans solo and indiana jones ive described this show to others as a western science fiction show it is set in space yet it is filled with scenes with horses shoot outs and bar room brawls everything about it makes it enjoyable and fun even though humor is a part of firefly there are moments of intense drama and darkness you experience many things with the crew sense of family loss loyalty love suspense and laughter firefly was also made very well the writing acting and everything about each episode makes this show special you will not be disappointed bringing the crew and their lives into your home 
i got both firefly the series and the movie serenity for christmas the former is the late lamented television show that was the brainchild of joss whedon creator of buffy the vampire slayer and angel which explains why the title joss whedons firefly appears a lot the four dvd set firefly the complete series includes all episodes of the series which is set years in the future and reminds those of a sense of television history that star trek was originally sold as wagon train to the stars because the western elements of this series are as strong as the science fiction elements since this is a joss whedon creation the obvious question is what sort of twists did he put into this one the most obvious is that this is a science fiction series without aliens apparently there was nobody out there after all or else they are hiding really well the other major twist is that in the future there were just two superpowers the united states and china which explains why the characters tend to curse in chinese now and then i think if more people had known that there was a television show that was more explicit that south park that would have meant high enough ratings for firefly to survive finally you have to appreciate that if this is western set in outer space it is one that existed after the civil war clearly captain mal reynolds nathan fillion has the die hard spirit of a bitter confederate veteran from my perspective the only real problem with firefly is that it lacks a strong story arc for this abbreviated first season i might be making too much of this but one of the strengths of whedons other shows was that he always makes excellent use of story arcs using by wedding a first half story arc to another one in the second half of season the closest things we have to driving story arcs are the mysterious alliance forces trying to capture river summer glau and her brother simon sean maher and mal and irana morena baccarin wasting time insulting each other instead of getting on to business so to speak both of those are clearly there but things were progressing too slowly for my taste i know whedon had some big payoff for the first one but he was keeping it awfully close to the vest and if this revelation is not a major part of the planned movie i will be totally surprised the strength of the series is in the characters of the crew all of who are realized with some degree of depth my favorite was kaylee jewel staite who was smart as she was cute a killer combination in my book captain mal reynolds was the most fully realized of the crew mainly because he had a pivotal role in most of the episodes but with the rest of the crew of serenity you know there was more to come we got a little of the back story on what mal and zo gina torres did during the big war and there was a flashback that told how jayne cobb adam baldwin and the rest of the crew were hired on by mal but it is the secret behind river tams strange condition that is is going to be the key in everything that happens next which you will now when you watch serenity it was also great to see ron glass as another familiar face in the regular cast of the episodes collected here eight of them have commentary by various cast members fillion baccarin tudyk and staite and writers whedon tim minear and jane espenson and others the additoinal special features include three behind the scenes featurettes deleted scenes alan tudyks audition joss whedon singing the firefly theme and a gag reel the last three are actually three separate things each dvd comes with its own thin plastic cd box with shots of mal reynold shepard book jayne cobb and zoe washburne posing in front of assorted nebulas on the respective covers notice that the alien landscape continues inside the slipcase the more i watch firefly the more it grows on me kaylee is currently my favorite character with her combination of cuteness and competence although after watching serenity it is hard not to be totally captivated by summer glaus river i just wish firefly had not come at the expense of dark angel in terms of foxs willingness to spend money on a show with a big special effects budget the irony that both shows were gone before the season was half over is not lost on me either in a much better world than this one both shows would have survived but having neither is really the short end of the stick for fans of science fiction on television 
im sad theres only one season of firefly the characters in this series are fun interesting and bounce off one another excellently its a great lead into the serenity movie as well my only negative comment is that the tv series has a slower pace than the movie but the characters are great enough that its not a detriment to the star rating stars 
yep its true i finally got around to watching firefly a few months ago im a full time student with a full time job so im pretty wary when it comes to taking on new interests that have the potential to distract me from studying lets face it normal people can read a book or watch a tv show and move on with their lives but nerd hobbies are all consuming fearing a repeat of last summer during which time i watched all seasons of angel i decided to give firefly a shot only when i found out how short the series was just episodes and a movie i thought how consuming an interest could this show possibly be well what do you know im hooked i was hooked right away in fact the theme song got me im not even kidding ive read some books in my life that really had a profound effect on me ive seen fewer movies that moved me as much but for a television show to do the same is exceedingly rare as of now people before me have written star reviews about how firefly is one of the greatest shows of all time and about what a waste of potential its premature cancellation was honestly theres not much i can say that hasnt been said by at least a couple thousand other browncoats the one bad thing about my firefly experience is that watching it was a little bittersweet on my first viewing it was a bit depressing to take such a heartfelt interest in the characters all the while knowing there was so little left of it to see fortunately fans have been given some closure with the excellent film serenity no its not the or so seasons the series deserved to have but its a fitting end nonetheless having seen the film i no longer feel depressed when watching the episodes so if youre even later to the firefly party than i was i highly recommend that you see it but consider yourself warned for just episodes and a movie firefly packs a big punch 
you know when a show this fun this creative this funny this brilliant cant even be allowed to survive a full season on television its about time to just unplug our tvs altogether joss whedons only mistake i suppose was making a show that wasnt about surgeons lawyers or cops then maybe firefly would have had a chance maybe if hed written another copycat crime drama that took itself too seriously or some meaningless and mundane sitcom hed have had something that would go on for season after season but no he made something really cool is the word for it quality unique heaven forbid the network powers that be would let that continue update october going on many years now and still have not watched the fox network since their shameful treatment of this series yep fans have long memories and hold grudges 
as a latecomer to firefly badgered by a friend into watching it i ask myself why did i wait so long its totally terrific another long review isnt necessary just watch it and youll see for yourself 
i stumbled upon the movie serenity by chance after which i just had to watch firefly the series firefly brings to the screen the story of a firefly class spaceship and its crew consisting of an unlikely yet lovable group of people and the adventures they find themselves in nathan fillion morena baccarin sean maher summer glau and the rest of this extraordinary cast including christina hendricks as a gorgeous villain have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least all the actors without exceptions give it their and it really shows the chemistry is amazing very well written and very well presented it allows for a thought provoking series that can be watched over and over again the setting the plot the dialogues and the music are all wonderful in short firefly along with serenity is definitely a series worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your dvd collection as it will surely provide for hours of entertainment bring back the show 
like the bug its named after this show burned very brighly for an instant i never even knew it was on tv but i heard about it after the fact through friends once the dvd series set was released i cant really say anything about this show that hasnt been said but i supposed the most amazing thing to me about firefly is that my wife doesnt even like sci fi as a genre but she really loved this series the stories and the characters transcend the genre firefly isnt just great sci fi but great story telling period 
this series was based on the story and the characters and had a great deal to offer a few hints every so often about the mystery of one characters past a question as to why on another the story had a lot to offer it is unfortunate that show was aired so sketchy and cancelled before it was given a chance the only thing wrong with the series was that it never had the chance to answer some of the questions left open by its sudden unexpectedly being cancelled 
this short lived series by joss whedon is an excellent blend of the sf and western genres as with all whedons work the characterization is sharp humorous and spot on there is a large cast about whom you will care almost immediately and the acting and fx are all first rate unfortunately quot firefly quot was not well promoted and after being moved around was cancelled before all the episodes were even on tv however all episodes made are on this set together with many extras including commentaries by whedon on several episodes also a feature film quot serenity quot has recently been announced for if you need another positive review to convince you to buy and watch this show well this is it highly recommended 
because of my schedule i had taped firefly on the vcr to watch later and boy was i missing out the dvd made me realize how fabulous the production values were something an old vcr tape could never do the widescreen format is great too even if you were a casual fan of firefly buy this set otherwise youre missing out on one of the best episodes quot the message quot which never saw the light of day on fox jaynes hat was a hoot keep your fingers crossed and hope the movie gets made someday soon because the firefly story is far from over at least for me 
firefly is one of the most amazing stories that never got told if you are new to the world of firefly serenity and you like great characters action humor love sadness triumphs and failures then this is a great buy for you im not a huge fan of sci fi or westerns but the combination of the two with the amazing talents of all the actors writers and joss whedon is magical if you are familiar with the series cant stop the signal 
owning all of joss whedons released dvds buffy angel i had certain pre conceived expectations about the show jw shows his immense talent as a storyteller in firefly he did an extraordinary job of creating mult dimensional characters and weaving them into entertaining plots id be curious to see what jw could do if he were given the opportunity to do something with the trek franchise as for his own creation its too bad that fox shelved firefly hopefully the upcoming firefly movie will jumpstart the series 
i dont watch much tv anymore theres just not a lot out there i find interesting but i have been a joss whedon fan since the first season of buffy and you know what even i didnt watch firefly when it came out on fox i saw about minutes of it and thought enh then the series came out on dvd serenity was being made into a movie and i thought id give it another chance im so glad i did there are some great episodes here and theyre gasp in order fox originally showed the second episode first for some reason it kept getting pre empted and moved around so it never really found a home the pilot is a wonderful introduction to the series but one of the best episodes out of gas also serves as a good introduction just watch it youll see also id recommend watching the bonus features at the end and i never watch those this was how i finally understood why all the characters just randomly burst into chinese phrases apparently josss version of the future makes note of the fact that the us and china are the two major superpowers so naturally everyone would be sprinkling mandarin chinese into their everyday speech this is never really explained in the series and once i understood that i just thought it was brilliant of course i think everyone should be a joss whedon fan but lets face it then what would those of us who are have to feel superior about 
this is going to be a strange review i bought this series in because i remember that few shows i saw i liked it came in and i started watching and well i stopped after the third show time passed and the movie came out and i bought it watched it and i had my fill of firefly then this summer i moved and as i packed i found my copiy of firefly when i unpacked i put it out on the dvd player for later well after five years i got around to watching it i watched all shows and the extras there are firefly addicts out there who love this show as the trekkies love startrek however i am not one of those but i fell under fireflys spell i really loved the characters the ship and the music the later episodes were eye openers for me they contained subject matter that i never expected from this series for example inaras love interest with another woman mals love scene with a madame the married couple preparing for battle and fighting over having a baby the last show about the bounty hunter really made me sad because it broght up things that i wanted anwers to i e when the bounty hunter said that book was no shepard remember the show when he got shot and produce his id and the alliance went all respectfull rivers deadly shooting was just beginning to show well i could go on and on the point for a buyer is that this series was truly too good for tv and we will never see this type of show again that is a shame 
when this show debuted the networks tried to bill firefly as a hip funny sci fi western i still remember the quick flick promo commercials hip that word has been used so much it has lost its original meaning firefly stayed away from star trek cliches and worse it was crafted deeply and thoroughly so that nothing in the sets the fx or the characters would make it dated it is just as clean to watch now in the age of ipods as it was years and years ago the show is not about technology its about people thats people with a small p people like us not loverboy captain kirk not stuck up janeway not give me a break paternal picard mal is just mal like river said bad in the latin funny in tv land to call a show funny is to tell the average viewer they are watching a comedy show and the average viewer and im not being insulting who wants to see a comedy is turned off when they are subjected to something different and edgy firefly is witty in the dramatic way edgy cutting its humor is the smile that comes between sorrows the laugh is evoked seamlessly without need of an actors pause for the laugh track there are no lauigh tracks in fact the scene has already moved past the moment that has you chuckling and in the next instant blood will pulse from a knife slash and no ones smiling anymore the characters are in pain leaving the formerly chuckling audience wincing in sudden deep quiet discomfort your average tv viewer does not like being made unconfortable by a show they were told would be funny that in turn made the tv execs uneasy firefly was not following a formula even the sexuality woven into the show was not following tv land conventions it was all tension tension tension with no simple happy resolution at the end of the hour sci fi western admittedly a different approach a flavor but western can also be a term of derision forget western and think frontier in its classic sense you only see a horse once in a long while for the entire series cows only once or twice but remember that the westerns that endure to this day were about the stories of the people on the prairie not the prairie itself not the horses not the guns think about it a horse is a cheaper means of transport on a planet without roads and cows man without beef never a fan of the good the bad and the ugly would see a parallel here firefly is not a failed series tv cable broadcast media failed to recognize a well crafted piece the movie serenity will complete this partial gem i suggest you watch firefly now by the time serenity is available and in your player everything will slide into place as the season finale that never happened all those years ago 
to be honest i did not get into this show when it first aired after seeing serenity i gave it another chance and all i can say is joss ill never doubt you again i bought this at amazon com from an awesome deal i found on dailytool com 
its either the most original humanistic funny heartfelt remarkable and enduring sci fi mash up in television history or you just dont get it im in the first group damn you fox one season for the th time its just not fair but i thank you for it none the less shiny to say the least 
this is not a review for fans to read because nothing i can say will help you make a decision or give you any new facts about the forthcoming film or really say anything fascinating and insightful about firefly this is a review for those of you who like me had never heard of firefly until amazon com recommended it to me when that happened i immediately dismissed the show as crap because of the description listed for the item i mean really it made it sound like your run of the mill scifi channel crapola stake a claim in the action take any job to keep fuel in the tanks and food on the table desperate to steer clear of alliance ships and the flesh eating reavers who live on the fringes of space that friends is a recipe for an unimaginative worthless and otherwise forgettable tv series thank goodness the description was so stupidly wrong im not sure why i even went out and bought it two months later but wow im glad i did sure that hard boiled frontiersman outlaw rough and tumble badass description is part of the show what the box doesnt tell you is that apart from the very very good pilot episode none of that stuff is at the forefront its never just about the job theyre doing or the money they need or about running from reavers or even running from the alliance because the writers knew that would be dumb this show is honest to goodness about the characters even the gratuitous geisha yes i know they call her a companion but i didnt know that when i was deciding whether or not to buy the show and yes she is gratuitous so please dont ravage me for not understanding why shes there character has some manner of depth while we may not like every aspect of every character or even understand why they were written in the characters are always the focus their decisions emotions actions and concerns are what makes the show more than just a scifi western action show but lets not forget the scifi western action elements those like the writing effects sets plots and characters are supurb the universe of firefly is very rich always interesting and something we can identify with theres never too much western and never too much scifi to swallow at one sitting so dont buy this set because you like science fiction buy it because you like good tv and good fiction 
sure i vaquely remember seeing ads for firefly when it was actually on the air but all they did was make me wince at what looked like a completely unwatchable blend of sci fi and western another cheaply made cliche ridden type of bad science fiction television it abounds i have never been more wrong about a show in my entire life a friend handed me the series dvd and told me to i had to watch it it was sooo good being off for the summer and with seemingly no good television left on the air i thought why not halfway into the pilot episode i was hooked completely totally irretrievably and obsessively hooked i have not been so taken in by a series since well i cant really remember i have proudly upheld fireflys star rating here on amazon and i do so with absolutely no reservations everything about this show was original interesting and well done lots of humor angst romance drama and adventure and great production values make this a treat to see but the real strength lies in the ensemble cast and the subtle deep and complex characterizations between them this ensemble is one of the finest i have ever run across and it shows do what i did and take a chance nearly two years after this show came on the air i am one of fireflys biggest fans i am betting anyone who sees the series dvd will be too 
a western set in space is that the most stupid idea ever that was my first thought but after seeing the first episode it had me hook line and sinker joss is once again king of series tv not only because of putting this idea together but also for finding the writers who can carry it off with the style that is this series i am in love with this show so i am trying not to get mushy but the characters are to die for they are all so real yet bigger than life captain mal while having a hidden soft side is not someone that you would want angry at you he will get the job done jayne is a character unto himself he is hysterical at times while he is the muscle in the show and i dont think you are really supposed to like him he is adorable maybe not someone you would want to marry but someone you certainly would want to date book hummm you have to wonder about him zoe and wash are great together a perfect blend wash is a scene stealer too simon and river are great to watch you are always wondering what is coming up with the two of them inara and kaylee are beautiful you never get tired of the two of them the main storyline rolls on show after show and never loses your attention the substories are true treasures if you have any interest in an engaging story great effects and pure pleasure this is the dvd for you and a hearty hurray that serenity the movie will be coming out in theaters this fall i am just thankful that i have dvd sets like this one so that i am spared that horrible reality tv that is everywhere now are there so few writers and ideas left that we are stuck with idiots on an island for entertainment 
love love love this show had to have it no regrets except that there should have been more episodes 
having glanced over the hundreds of reviews for this amazing series i had two thoughts first was that i really didnt need to say anything as it had all been said so eloquently and often already second however was how amazing it was that so many people have become or remained loyal fans of this too short lived show i have never before seen so many reviews for any item on amazon which still maintained such a high rating the complaints are certainly few and far between for this reason i am throwing my in i can only hope that perhaps some network or studio exec is checking out these reviews and realizing that the audience for the show and maybe the movie is so much more vast than they assumed as for the series this is one of the overall best things i have seen on television i am a fan of buffy and angel and so have some loyalty to joss whedon the creator of both aformentioned shows as well as firefly however i am also a very critical television watcher i watch certain shows religiously but very little beyond those i wait for the diamonds in the rough and try to give them a chance to shine before giving up on them but just have very little time to allow for this firefly did not make me go through this process it was shiny from day one even given the idiotic network decision to air it beginning with episode rather than the intended pilot i was a little confused as to who all these folks were but the show engaged me immediately regardless the concept is not as odd as it sounds the master storytellers at mutant enemy make this a completely believable universe and the gifted actors do a wonderful job of bringing to life the characters that are the heart of the show as i said before all that can be said about firefly has already been said all i will tell you is that regardless of what genre of television you normally watch you owe it to yourself to purchase or rent this dvd you will find yourself a member of the browncoats in no time keep flying 
every episode is wonderful i rate this as good as all the star trek series and sequels i cant believe it was not renewed what is wrong with the tv and movie people this would be a tremendous moneymaker if it had more backing wake up i will truly miss all that could have been 
in this short lived tv series at first i was wary of a sci fi western show but soon got hooked the anti hero theme seems to be a favorite of joss whedons but no complaints here once again he makes women a force to be reckoned with and i found that the companion character a whore who was the most respectable person as far as society was concerned in this ensemble cast was pure genius all of the universal themes of honor love betrayal friendship and mans role in society are here and comedy threads them all together in riveting tv format the character of jayne resident macho tough guy was especially laugh out loud funny i watched the series and mourned the loss when fox cancelled this show along with everyone else so i was very happy to be able to get all of the episodes in this complete series dvd it was great to be able to watch every episode even the three unaired ones however i was a little disappointed in extras included in this set i missed the lack of commentaries the most overall a bargain since this set will be sure to inspire repreated viewings 
i was no fan of buffy et al but my wife told me that joss weedon was coming out with a sci fi show so i gave it a chance the first episode hooked me bad no star trek anything here scummy run down selfish renegades insanity good boys gone bad and animal mother what more could you want as others have said if youre reading this you know the plot premise so i wont dwell on that too much the anti utopian universe of this show however flies in the face of virtually all space set television from the s on weedon combines paranoia about big government with piratical parasites mixing in a dose of the x files and a hit of blue velvet just to make me shiver with halluncinatory delight most sci fi shows have been about maintaining the status quo including all the white knights who pilot the ufp starships across re run hell firefly is about running away from the culture about a failed rebellion against a totalizing post capitalist galaxy that offers citizens every advance but brooks no individual eccentricity the characters on firefly have been flushed into the sewer of this universe and they like it the utter nihilism of this show impressed me on the first episode where the crew betray their smuggling operation to supply drugs to impoverished minors the gangsters thugs come to menance them and one swears to hunt the crew to the ends of the universe our captain kicks the thug into the turbo fan i loved the show from that point on sure there were weak points and the plots didnt always skirt the absolute edge all the time but seeing a totally immoral amoral and vicious character like adam baldwins play against the goody goody doctor and his crazed sister was just fine with me fox made a mistake cancelling this show why seven seasons of st tng and not firefly i guess on tv only the nice guys finish first 
i must confess that i missed firefly during its brief run and was only introduced to it when a friend gave me this set for christmas after watching it i cant believe that i passed on such a wonderful series or the stupidity of the fox network in botching its presentation im not going to echo the same praises sung by the many positive reviews of this set only to say that i am in agreement with the wonderful things written about it this is television at its best with quality acting good special effects and some of the best writing around each episode draws viewers into a developing story and while not every episode is perfect in particular i found safe to be rather formulaic and disappointing each can also stand alone in its own right as an entertaining tale but one of the most interesting aspects of the set wasnt on the discs but on the slip cases the progression of the episodes in the set seems natural upon viewing yet upon reading the airdates of the shows i began to understand why the show was cancelled they offer stark testimony of how fox shuffled episodes around and broadcast them out of sequence turning a clear and progressive narrative into a confusing jumble of events its led me to conclude that in this day and age the only way to truly appreciate what the creators of television series are trying to achieve is on dvd where it can escape the idiotic tinkering that network executives constantly undertake so watch this and see a television series as its creator intended it to be seen free from the moronic meddling of network executives that have marred the fate of so many good shows 
i hate myself i hate myself for not paying better attention when this series was alive fresh on tv we american tv consumers are idiots and we pay for it in talk shows and reality tv like many others here i was captivated by the quirky ads for the film serenity i was hooked from the first landing of that great little ship and crew i saw the movie again a couple of days later which i rarely do a little web searching and i found the dvd series ive just finished disc this series and related film serenity capture the best of what it is to be a human and the worst in the persona of capt mal reynolds nathan fillion plays the ultimate redemption tale a man who has been on the right side and lost the battle a man who has lost his faith yet remains good at the core just because the series teaches with humor drama and poignancy what love really is i thought i was just getting these for me my year old very cool football playing son ended up watching the whole series in one day while home sick from school he wanted to talk about some of the things he learned about people from the shows i think his time was better spent that day watching firefly than it was in school 
five hundred years from now we have a crew of a star ship they are not out to explore strange new worlds not contact new civilizations they are out to make a fast buck and are not finicky about legalities in doing so firefly was a kind of space western with situations and dialogue that were top notch example the captain of the star ship retorts to one of his crew im pissed off and heavily armed so why are we having this conversation it was too bad that the network put the series in a bad time slot showed the episodes out of order and then cancelled the series before it could find an audience it may turn out to be the biggest programming blunder since nbc cancelled the first star trek highly recommended 
the high quality special effects superior cast entertaining writing and tongue in cheek style made this one of the most enjoyable sci fy series ever how it could have gotten canceled so soon is beyond me it has one of my favorite movie lines ever and jane adam baldwin getting his ass kicked by a lb girl is never gonna get old 
most would probably agree that their interpretation of josh whedon isnt all that great i found myself along these same lines mainly because of the buffy the vampire slayer slayer and angel and ive never considered myself a fan of his work while i had watched buffy on more than one occassion it was mainly due to the fact that there was nothing else on at the time so i watched it during those offbeat times then when firefly aired i had caught an episode or two and soon stopped watching it for various reasons but i think the main reason was because it didnt hold my attention at the time when the series was announced to be coming out as a dvd boxed set i was like okay i think ill pick this one up and considering that the price at the time was more than enough of a reason to check out this series after watching the first episode i soon remembered watching this series on television and sat through all episodes of this set i soon became enamored with this series and quickly wondered why this show hasnt been brought back by the powers that be recently universal studios just released the movie serenity the big screen adaption of the television series which served to wrap up the lingering plotlines that were left open in the television series and served as a finale tribute to the short lived television series even if there were no more firefly projects in the works it was nice to return for a visitto this wonderful universe of characters josh whedons direction for this series is plainly evident in these epsiodes that accompany this wonderful set and considering the multitudes of science fiction that is available this is one of those very rare science fiction shows that actually fares a lot better than star trek babylon battlestar galactica farscape andromeda and the like the writing for these characters in firefly actually is so well written and well acted that you cant help but fall in love with the characters that take you along for their adventures its just a shame that not many science fiction fans have discovered this series just yet there are some episodes that are quite amusing and the writing of some of the episodes is so well done that its believable and doesnt leave you shaking your head and wondering how the shows writers can defy the laws of gravity or physics evertything about this show doesnt leave you feeling like you cant feel for these characters or what they are going through if you get the chance you really should check out this series im a hard fan to satisfy especially when it comes to science fiction but this series really needs to be experienced in its entirety before coming to a final judgement call on the show the western theme of the series did die out after the sixth episode mainly due to the studios concern with josh whedon and the deviation away from the western theme also seemed to make the acting a lot better as well 
im extremely happy with my dvd firefly the complete series this is by far the very best sc fi series ever written joss whedon is a genius i love all the characters in the series especially the character of captain malcolm reynolds so very aptly and skillfully played by nathan fillion the story of the firefly and its crew is delightful bizarre at times funny deadly serious with a lot of violence action packed and never disappoints the viewer nathan fillion has to be one of the most courageous actors of his time taking on a role where in one episode he appears nude the nude scenes are done in a puckish manner with taste and great aplomb i do not recommend that young children be allowed to watch it 
this is one of the best shows tv has ever had how the network could have canceled it i do not understand i recomend this i found this web site that has information on the movie looking forward to sept th release 
carnivale jack bobby sportsnight the job star trek the best shows burn bright hard and fast and are always ultimately killed before their time firefly is the hardest example of this disturbing phenomenon fox wanted an action oriented sci fi franchise with a built in fan base joss re wrote and re tooled and addressed every one of their notes the show was groundbreaking beloved by critics and had a fanatical following before the first episode ever aired so naturally fox dumped it in the time slot of death friday evenings began the show by premiering with the second episode not the pilot which explains who these people are and why you should give a damn sporadically removing the show even from this slot some weeks sometimes without even saying so after episodes less than half a season fox canceled the series before it ever had a chance the fans rallied and mr whedon was able to retain the rights to the show shopping it around until universal picked it up as the major motion picture serenity a bittersweet triumph of sci fi that wraps the show up beautifully buy this series and give it a chance no one who watches the whole first disc comes out the other side a non fan its quite simply the best television series in human history 
i remember when i first heard about this western in space series and laughed it off thinking it sounded like a silly idea i never watched the series and when it disappeared shortly after i felt no loss at the prodding of friends i bought the movie dvd and watched it it was decent and the setting was interesting enough this last weekend i was bored and snagged the dvd set on a whim in a single day i watched the entire series my wife who hates when i even pass the sci fi chanel on the tv ended up watching the whole series and now cannot wait to see the movie probably tonight just not enough hours in a single day i have to say the series was a complete surprise as how good it ended up being a great character study with just enough action to keep you from thinking it is just a drama the characters are great you learn to care about them the setting of the show pulls you in and makes you want more and the special effects are outstanding overall i am very pleased i decided to purchase this dvd set and highly recommend it to everyone 
i agree with most reviewers this is top notch sci fi and just plain damn excellent entertainment why dose fox alway cancle the good stuff and keep the s remember futurama they brought that back too bad another network did not pick it up there is so much crap tv out there and they drop this show just makes no sense the movie was also great work these actors worked very well together sigh 
i wasnt able to keep up with the show when it first came out fox but from the few i saw i really enjoyed it at least enough to go out and buy the box set probably one of the best buys ive made because the depth of the show and its characters is amazing each crew member from serenity brings different qualities and as a crew you can see them struggling to find themselves and to just survive fireflys got a great combination of action drama and comedy there are some great serious touching moments and then some of the highest of high comedy any scene with jayne in it is bound to be funny im pretty sad that once i finish the dvd set i cant look forward to more seasons but at least serenity is coming to the big screen i hope it gets enough good reviews to get fox to consider reupping the series anyways give the dvd set a look its well worth it 
first off if you havent seen serenity go see it not only will you be in for a corker of a movie its another pie in the face of fox the company that pulled this series from our screens i am not a fan of star trek buffy or angel to be honest i find them a bit formulaic and bland for me firefly is something entirely new it is fresh fiery and brilliantly different to any other sci fi i have seen in recent memory i am a believer that regardless of an astronomical budget every hollywood star out there and infinitely large explosions good tv aint good tv if the script sucks you will quickly find that the scripts for this series really do shine the characters leap from the tv the plots twist and turn and nothing is ever resolved by re calibrating the discombobulator it is a sad indication of the state of modern tv that this show was pulled if hollywood and big tv networks are anything they are not risk takers i guess the figures didnt instantly add up with firefly and it was canned i can only assume that fox thinks that we the public are unintelligent unimaginitive suckers i guess the tv execs arent visionaries even if joss whedon is 
 firefly what does that word bring to mind for some nothing or maybe at most some kind of bug with a beautiful name for a few like me and maybe you firefly is a great though somewhat weird show that was untimely cancelled by fox we were robbed of the opportunity of watching that show but at least we enjoyed it while it was on air so i think that we were the lucky ones fortunately this dvd allows everybody to be a winner in the sense that if you lost the opportunity of watching the series you can do it now and if you already watched and loved the series you can watch it again as many times as you want should i tell you something about the series in case you are completely clueless regarding firefly well firefly is a sci fi western produced by joss whedon the person behind buffy the vampire slayer and angel the series is set in the future and it tells the story of a group of rebels that oppose the alliance a dictatorial government these rebels live in a ship the serenity and their leader is malcolm reynolds nathan fillion a former officer in a war against the alliance that his side lost we also have zoe mals second officer played by gina torres and her husband wash washburne a pilot played by alan tudyk we cannot forget the utterly unlikable jayne adam baldwin kaylee a mechanic and an eternal optimist played by jewel staite shepherd book ron glass inara morena baccarin simon tam a doctor played by sean maher and his sister river summer glau a psychic on whom the alliance experimented before she managed to escape in a nutshell this series is pure unadulterated fun that was cut short for thousands due to the fact that it was cancelled when merely of the episodes this dvd contains had been aired i suppose that the fact that fox is behind the release of dvd could be seen as some kind of atonement for the cancellation of the show i dont know in any case i am pretty sure that more people will become fans of firefly after watching this dvd and that wont hurt the chances that the show has of returning to the small screen finally i would like to highlight the fact that the bonus features that firefly offers are great but what really completes this dvd is another one serenity serenity now available in dvd format is an excellent film directed by joss whedon and based on the firefly series that provides it with an interesting ending if you can purchase both firefly and serenity at the same time you wont regret it and you will save some time belen alcat
when it was on the air i never caught a single episdoe of firefly and now i feel sorry i did not on a whim and at the suggestion of a couple friends i bought this dvd set and after seeing all episodes i do not regret one bit the loss in my checking account this series had such potential and fox gave up on it with out seeing what it was going to do there is other scifi on the air that started slow but has become great stargate sg andromeda farscape just to name a couple but networks gave them a shot and they turned into gold for them this release of this wonderful series from the fox network is proof once again that scifi never gets its due on the major networks i am so looking forward to the movie as i watch my set of episodes a second time since getting it this weekend ps am i the only one ticked that we will never get to hear what shepard books story is now that this series is off the air 
i watched the movie first and i loved it i had to buy the series it is just as good maybe even better because it expands your appreciation for the characters i love the dialogue im so sorry that this series was cancelled because it really deserved better 
there was once some years ago now a television show that involved heroes real clever gritty heroes who dressed like cowboys flew spaceships and cursed in mandarin chinese they exchanged witty repartee travelled the verse from one end to the other looking for work honest or not and even attended a couple of shindigs when things got a little slow there was always the psychotic psychically gifted child to look after or the flesh mutilating cannibals from the edge of space to avoid and then fox in a decision even more mind numbingly stupid than airing any of its reality shows cancelled it mid season thanks to the efforts of browncoats as firefly fans call ourselves firefly lives again with all fourteen episodes two of them originally unaired and some juicy extras on four dvds joss whedons sci fi western fantasy world once described to me as star wars but han solos world with han still shooting first is one of the most original things to air on television in a long while possibly ever firefly is set approximately five hundred years in the future in a new universe with terraformed planets made inhabitable for earth colonists whose numbers have grown too many for earth that was chinese and western cultures are the dominant influences characters dress like john wayne and are fluent in chinese at least enough to swear in unlike most sci fi there are no aliens the reavers cannibals who mutilate their own flesh and eat others were once human too till something drove them over the edge of sanity the alliance a hyper controlling government coalition of the central planets manages most legal trade and activities and have ever since they won a war some years back with the independents or browncoats with the alliance in control of all legal economic activity those browncoats were forced to retreat to the raggedy edge taking what jobs they could to eke out an existence some of these are the crew of serenity a most rag tag group of compatriots whose numbers include warrior woman zoe her husband geeky pilot wash cheerful and nave mechanic kaylee gentle man of the cloth shepherd book exotic geisha like companion inara ships doctor simon tam and his genius but damaged sister river and mans man jayne the blunt mercenary with a softer side they are led by captain malcolm mal reynolds who is if nothing else a man of determination who lives by his own code of honor stand by your crew love your ship get the job done it is in this world with these people that firefly makes its home and what a home it is even though we only get fourteen episodes it is easy to develop attachments to these characters and to care about what happens to them whedons stories are tailored to provide layered character development with each episode building on the last ones jokes and insights even serenity the ship itself becomes a character of sorts its nooks and crannies feel familiar and homely something to be loved and protected in this short span of time we also learn that book is not all he appears to be that river has been brutally experimented on by the alliance to make her into a weapon and that mal has serious issues with womenfolk and relationships it is sad that these hints of stories were cut off before they could be told one senses that firefly could have developed into the most interesting show on television if handled properly what it undeniably is however is fourteen episodes worth of brilliance whedons dialogue is one of the high spots of the show rarely has anything been as quotable as firefly the wacky humor and the often unfamiliarly westernized syntax give a simultaneously homey and foreign feel to the show and its characters we recognize these people as kin to us but maybe second cousins the theme song is particularly good an innately hummable ballad that will stick in your head even when youre not watching the show the acting is truly amazing although there are no big names here everyone delivers heartfelt performances that feel real and personal they make us care about their characters its hard to pick a standout performer this crew works together as an outstanding ensemble and they are the core of the shows strength theres no shortage of action either as outlaws on the run from the government and sometimes disgruntled employers the crew of serenity encounter their share of enemies including the sadistic dr niska and the sinister bounty hunter jubal early and theres river too prone to psychotic episodes that endanger everyone in her path there are true gems even amongst the fourteen my favourite episodes are shindig our mrs reynolds war stories and objects in space all of them are excellent but these four combine all the elements of style dialogue humor and action into episodes that will inspire side splitting laughter and some moments that will take your breath away a sidenote there is a movie addition to the firefly verse in the form of serenity its darker and grittier than firefly but well worth seeing on its own merit as a fabulous space opera so go ahead embrace your inner browncoat and immerse yourself in the wonder of the firefly that was take me out to the black tell them i aint comin back burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me 
gene roddenberry originally pitched star trek to the networks as wagon train to the stars and gunsmoke in space i love trek but the show always seemed more like a commentary on society it used aspects of science fiction as an allegory to address difficult issues of what was going on in the world in the late s now with firefly it seems like joss whedon has finally realized roddenberrys original dream this is a really fun show it is a science fictions show with cattle rustling gun fights whore houses train robberies bounty hunters and so on basically all the essential elements to a great western admittedly the show starts out a little dry its my feeling that most shows start out that way though because you have to wade through all the introductions to characters settings and such that being said by the time i was done with the first disc in the set i was hooked to set the basic story it takes place in the future where the only two surviving super powers are the united states and china this series takes place several years after a war where a crew of misfits the best kind of crews aboard a smuggling ship are trying to stay independent and keep out of reach of an increasingly oppressive government firefly is something completely different than anything whedon did in his buffy shows the most noticeable difference is that joss and crew are writing for adult characters instead of characters in their late teens there is not the witty back and forth banter that was so characteristic of the buffy shows the characters in this show are a little darker but less brooding they are all conflicted and they all have secrets to hide sometimes the characters are almost more interesting for what they dont say there is a lot of mystery and a lot of questions in this show unfortunately this series is barely able to touch upon that it was canceled by fox way too soon too bad because i think a second and third season could have been explosive hopefully after the serenity movie comes out the new firefly movie joss is currently working on as i write this review a new station will pick up the show and let him finish the story i could be wrong but i believe something similar happened to babylon anyway fans of action based science fiction who have been itching for something new should definitely pick up firefly i think people who liked joss whedons work on buffy angel know what kind of stories he likes to weave and if you enjoy that kind of depth and complexity you really should check out this show 
great humor great action great sci fi too bad there isnt anymore i watch this series over and over again its really too bad that someone did not recognize just how fantastic this series truly was cant get enough the combination of characters storyline script plot action even the firefly ship is just what can i say great please bring it back ill buy it 
ill admit i watched the first episode shown on fox during its inital airing and didnt think it was that good but this of course was not the original pilot made so the show didnt make much sense to me flash forward three years and i am a convert i think after hearing that people were lining up for the pre screenings of the movie and hearing how dedicated all the fans were made me really curious i think always in the back of my mind i thought that it couldnt be that bad if the name whedon was on it having been a fan of buffy and angel for years and loving them and him delivering some of my favorite tv over the years my curiosity got the best of me and boy am i glad it did i watched the first two or three episodes and enjoyed it but it wasnt until about the th episode it really started to gel and show just how well written dramatic and at times funny this show was the mix of the character and interplay was very whedon which made me want to watch more and more until i was finished within two weeks the only bad thing no more episodes to see how these characters grow the good part at least we get a serenity movie so now i can experience the rage that all fans felt when fox yanked it prematurely from everyones living rooms when will they learn that you have to nuture a show and give it a fair shot 
joss whedon has created what is probably going to be a mainstay for generations to come great character development along with top notch story telling provides for hours of viewing enjoyment if yo are even remotely interested in this genre 
in the fall of when fox debuted this series there was a bit of controversy first the pilot was remade because they wanted more action then the network showed the episodes out of order normally this wouldnt be a major problem but with the storylines that writer creator joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer was putting together it became hard to keep up with the character changes not long into the first season fox cancelled it to add to their already insulting treatment of the show they showed the revamped pilot episode last some great writing direction and acting made this an excellent series truly a western in space with super special effects as well i am a bit bewildered by the choice to release the eps in full frame as i recall it was presented in widescreen format during its all too brief run maybe thats just an error that will be corrected before the release 
ill confess i refused to make time to watch this when it was on tv because i was disappointed that the angst and drama of buffy overcame the jocularity and playfulness it once had i had no faith in joss whedon to entertain me and the tiny bit of the show i saw once made no sense no doubt because fox directed that the episodes be aired out of sequence time passed thankfully one night when there was nothing on i settled on this i dont remember which episode but i gave it a chance this time and within minutes i was hooked i tivo ed it the next time it was on from the beginning and enjoyed the opening sequence just like that i was hooked the characters are quirky but believable and well developed enough that i wish thered been more chance to show their growth the scripts are clever and inventive the stories are amusing but almost beside the point since what i enjoy is the way the characters interact i especially enjoyed the out of gas episode with all the back story about the crew forming and the launch of the serenity but our mrs reynolds is also great and hints at what might have happened between mal and inara if fox hadnt dropped the ball i never caught dark angel either but based on what a gem i found firefly to be i think ill have to give that a try too good special effects a unique storyline set in a non trek future and this time joss was in top form i cant wait to get the dvd set to watch the episodes that never aired and im eager to see the big screen version when serenity opens if you like sci fi westerns quirky characters and clever dialogue or other joss whedon projects youll find something to love about firefly 
fox should learn its lesson with this one they should do everything they can to try to get this show back on the air the dvd sales have been nothing short of miraculous and the feature film looks like it is going to be great fox has made some pretty bad decisions when canning shows heres hoping theyll pull a family guy and give the show another chance if only to make the real money in dvd sales 
although firefly took a while to get its feet around the th episode once it got its space legs it was the best thing on tv last year it had wonderful characters who were given depth by an amazing cast challenging plots and an amazing look and feel futurama the tick firefly and andy richter rules the universe were four of the best shows on tv fox cacelled all of them before their time how can a network that is so good at developing cutting edge shows be so amazingly horrid at nurturing them once they hit the air so they can find their audience 
i never heard of the series firefly before we rented the movie luckily my brother who watched the movie with me ordered the series later we watched the series and it instantly became my all time favorite of any series movie show i have watched after watching at my brothers house i went out and placed an order to have it myself as well it just kills me that they havent made more seasons or movies i really hope they do both and soon at this price i felt like i was stealing when i ordered i would of paid easy for this series it is a must have 
firefly was a great show a show that could have been greater with only episodes many of which were never aired this character driven action packed sci fi tv series really was never given a chance with such wonderful episodes as war stories and out of gas it should have been around for five or six seasons this dvd set gives you all of it with added audio commentary on some of the episode deleted scenes a gag reel behind the scene features and even a easter egg of adam baldwin singing the hero of canton with the movie out maybe they will think about re starting the show new or used this is a must for any sci fi library 
this is one of those tv shows youll become a huge fan of if you arent already ive watched the series on tv and dvd and now streaming it something about the well cast crew and passengers of serenity the beleivable sci fi future set in a nearby star system ruled by america and china and the dusty gritty feel to most of the environments we see all combine with great direction and story lines of a not quite beaten independent captain operating below the radar of the rigidly conformist government and a pair of siblings hiding from nefarious schemes of that same institution to vault this show to classic status it is wonderful of amazon to offer firefly to prime members so take advantage and stream it now 
all you have to do is look at the air dates on the back of the dvd cases to see how fox royally screwed this show from the outset the episode that was meant to be the pilot to set up the entire series was not aired until the show was on the air for three months even then it was not aired in its entirety episodes were aired out of order so the story arcs did not flow and as a result the story did not make as much sense all this ensured the series could never gain a foothold anyone with any inkling of joss whedons storytelling style on his other shows knows the way fox handled this show was the death knell for it it is sad that these episodes and the movie serenity are all that will ever be of these characters and the world the writers were trying to create it was a unique blend of sci fi space exploration and wild west shoot outs there were many characters all with unique stories that could never been fully explored much like how buffy started out the cast was ensemble with lesser known actors in the lead roles nathan fillion was probably the most recognizable actor as the series started but even he was not a mega star all that said because all of the actors were good and the writing was top notch they pulled it off extremely well the best way i can describe the show is a mix of star trek and dukes of hazzard yet not as cheesy as the dukes could be if you are a fan of joss whedons other shows like buffy angel and dollhouse or even watched firefly when it was on the air but could never really get into it get the series and see it as it was meant to be seen it was a unique show in which the good guys were not totally good and the bad guys were not all bad there are a lot of shades of gray to the characters and everyone has a sense of being in it for themselves if you have seen the movie serenity and it did not make much sense this will fill in the gaps and give you the back story for the movie serenity shows where the series would have gone had it been given a chance now we can only wonder how they would have gone from point a to point b
i must now make my anguished confession i was one of those who let firefly die not that my watching it when it was first broadcast years ago would have saved it but i certainly would have been one of the thousands of fans who wrote to the fox network and helped pay for trade industry ads in an attempt to save the show only just now have i watched the complete series all episodes of it and i think it is one of the best shows in the history of television it is witty poignant exciting with a spaceship full of rich fully realized characters played by a sterling cast all the actors were so wonderful in fact that my favorite tended to be the one i was watching at the time i like science fiction and love westerns and joss whedons synthesis of the two genres went far beyond clever in a mere handful of episodes whedon and his collaborators created a totally convincing fictional world with consistent rules and very believable dangers the making of documentary in this dvd set demonstrates amply the attachment the actors and crew had to the show and to each other as well as the disappointment bordering on abject grief they felt at the shows cancellation im happy that most of fireflys actors have gone on to success but id much rather see nathan fillion as malcolm reynolds than as richard castle and while i wouldnt give up christina hendricks as joan harris for anything i will miss her as saffron the baddest bad girl in the galaxy in any case firefly is a textbook example of a program that should have premiered on premium cable where it would have had a chance for an audience to acclimate itself to the world of mal reynolds and his crew at least i have the feature film serenity to look forward to and i can buy this dvd set which i plan to do but meanwhile if jayne cobb decides to come after me vera in hand all i will be able to say in response is mea culpa 
theres really nothing that i can put here that has not already been said im just one more person who is hopelessly addicted to firefly although im disappointed that amazon raised the price of this set by which made it fall from its number spot in the top selling dvds list into the s the fact that it still remains in the top highest selling dvds is yet another testament to its enduring appeal never has a television show been more deserving of a renewal than this one fox if youre listening please put this show back on the air and consumers dont stop buying this set its one of the best dvd purchases you will ever make 
the episodes were well written and storylines well executed too bad the series lasted only a half a season i am glad that they came back and did the movie which was excellent if you like serenity then this is a must have in your collection 
i didnt have much interest in this tv show but bought it anyway because it is from the god like joss whedon i had recently become a huge convert to the buffy verse but was dubious about the premise of a space western silly me once id watched and rewatched all my buffy and angel dvds i just had to have more joss and turned in desperation to firefly i was hooked less than halfway into the pilot movie and had to fight the urge to call in sick the next day so i could watch the whole series back to back i was so distressed when i got to the last episode objects in space that i made myself go back and rewatch all the other episodes first so that i could savor the experience imagine my delight when i got online and discovered that joss and crew have already shot a feature film and that it will be out this spring firefly lives now about this premise the western thing took awhile to buy into but stick with it and before long galloping horses and the abundant use of aint get less jarring as all the pieces fall into place it all works for two reasons the ensemble cast is amazing and the cinematography is breathtaking it is so evident that each and every member of the cast and crew was having the time of their lives working on this show because each element is so meticulously perfect i dont have the vocabularly to convey how very very good the cast is this show wouldnt have worked without nathan fillion dare i say it he almost makes me forget captain piccard charisma angst comedy passion not to mention the good looks this boy has it all gina torres is a goddess and summer gua gives a beautifully nuanced performance adam baldwin is masterful and its a delight to see ron glass again all the episodes work but expect a wide range of genres theres horror bushwacked comedy our mrs reynolds classic sci fi ariel even a study of existentialism objects in space and thank you to joss for explainging that in the commentary the only episode i wasnt crazy about was the train job which isnt surprising since it was the networks misguided pilot do over this dvd set is loaded with extra features half of the episodes have commentary joss himself chimes in on three and several members of the cast participate as well it is so so refreshing that the stars of the show participate both in the commentaries and the making of featurettes i only have one teeny complaint more a piece of advice than a complaint really the title and individual episode menus dont indicate which episodes have commentary you have to click on the language selection option to find the commentary words fail me i cant thank joss whedon enough for this masterpiece and i am eternally grateful that he was so dedicated to the show that despite all obstacle hes made it into a feature film this is how much i love this show im seriously considering buying a plane ticket from armenia where i work to the states for the premiere of the film and im not even a sci fi geek well maybe a little id try to come up with more superlatives but i must go order copies for all my family and friends this is an obsession that must be shared 
i had a decent birthday yesterday my friend sent me disks of firefly i resisted watching these the original description made the show sound like a rip off of han solo so i come to this show years later and so sad it took this long i watched hours yesterday sometime during disk i got hooked and as my interest grew i noticed that the box said complete season not first season i saved the last episode and the serenity movie for tonight so my firefly topia isnt over yet i didnt get it at first how can you mix space age technology with gunslingers and the old west as the series progresses you come to realize the old west type planets are the outlying settlements away from the core as they call it human colonies staking a hold on new planets similar to the settlers migrating from mature european cities to colonize america there is a strong bond of camaraderie among the small ship crew that is tested again and again the banter of dialog is appreciatively written for a grown up perspective the lines delivered quick spoken in tones and undertones suitable for the relationship perspectives given the dialog and acting are full of nuances and suggestions raising the talent to a level that outshines its humble yet lovely theme song the brother sister characters river and simon the doctor the madness of river makes this relationship reminiscent of hamlet remember ophelia daisies for remembrance they can be quite chilling together the theme music can be haunting setting up the mood for your transportation to the firefly uni verse this dvd collection really is a treasure for the collector lara im still free you cant take the sky from me 
without an ounce of hyperbole this show was the best thing on television in the last thirty years better than mash hill street blues cheers seinfeld buffy st tng sopranos west wing anything because this show takes all those shows all the great aspects and beloved moments of those shows and mixes them into an altogether original and completely satisfying entertainment its a little sci fi show that has heavy western as in john wayne not as in hemisphere elements an elegant juxtaposition that brings the future and the past together in a way that makes is funnily remarkably current and fresh the drama part of the show leans towards the romantic like thirtysomething and the medical like er the action is more real and less lasers the science fiction part of the show is not about aliens or the weird its about how in the future people would either speak english or chinese both with equal facility the fact that their cursing and other interjections are spontaneously in chinese comes off hysterically funny plus it adds realism by avoiding bleeps the violence is not cartoonish at all the cast seriously is a joy to behold nathan fillion as captain malcolm reynolds is a find he brings a swashbuckling smart ass quality as the groups leader adam baldwin as the swaggering dim but aggressive jayne adds loutish humor to his well played menace gina torres as first mate zoe is a terrific character black smart beautiful capable loyal intense and female the type we need more of on television whether youre paralyzed by political correctness or not zoe is married to alan tudyks pilot wash who is the funny guy on the show but his function is not only to be funny the two of them add fun sexy moments to the ensemble sean maher as a young trauma surgeon hooray and summer glau as his mysterious odd sister river mix perfectly with the others rivers storyline adds a whole x files conspiracy thread and having a surgeon on board allows for all sorts of medical crises that elevate suspense and tension in the episodes everybody gets shot or stabbed at least once ron glass as the incredibly cool preacher shepherd book clearly has a past that is hinted about but due to the cancellation is never fully revealed but his character allows for the entry of several theologic and religious ideas that broaden many of the plots in ways you could have never expected jewel staite as the adorable mechanic kaylee is an irresistible creation cute and sexy fallible vulnerable but a whiz with the ship and finally miss baccarin as inara is there any male out there who saw this show and didnt absolutely melt whenever she came on the screen shes one of the most unexpectedly beautiful women ive ever seen she plays a companion a courtesan of sorts who generates blinding sparks with the captain palpable heat your tv set will get warmer its the classic situation they cant fall in love but you know they already have the scripts are impossibly funny unpredictable exciting never boring or routine whedon minear and friends lead you down a path that feels familiar and suddenly youre in a place you never considered blissfully the acting is top notch this is the best ensemble cast of recent memory better than the west wing better than the sopranos and i love those shows the special effects are nicely done and the cinematography in combination with the digital effects adds startling immediacy to the proceedings hand held shaky shots of a landing spaceship things slightly out of frame fast zooms to a ship out in the atmosphere its a brilliant idea perfectly executed it may be impossible to describe but once you see it youll know what im trying to describe after regretfully finishing the last episode i found myself angry i wanted more i was disappointed with myself that i didnt support the show when it was on the air i was disappointed that it was cancelled abruptly i was angry that hbo or somebody didnt take it over it goes without saying that i am now unbelievably excited for the movie this year but had not been before seeing this show my only hope is that enough people see the movie to make some ignorant network bigwig thing hey we should turn this into a tv show i love this show 
i remember watching this series when it first aired on fox and being disappointed when it abruptly vanished i was sure it would never be available to buy so i was kicking myself for not having taped all of the episodes for repeat viewing i was absolutely overjoyed when this came out on dvd and the boxed set does not disappoint the extras are cool the commentaries are absolutely terrific and even the packaging with very slim dvd cases that i think everybody ought to use is outstanding there are three episodes in this set that were never aired in the us and its such a joy and pleasure to be able to see them i think theyre some of the finest the series has to offer and a clear indicator that if it had been allowed to progress this show wouldve just gotten better and better i really cant recommend this dvd set strongly enough i received my copy as a gift soon after it came out and my roommate who says she likes the show but not enough to buy it has been quot borrowing quot discs on a regular basis ever since ive run the series with several friends and every one of them gets hooked quot firefly quot is a show thats easy to love and real easy to get addicted to i hear a movies in the works and i absolutely cannot wait also for those who havent seen it if you put in the last disc in this set go to the extras select the quot joss whedon sings the firefly theme quot extra and then key left theres an easter egg there of adam baldwin singing the ode to jayne from the episode quot jaynestown quot while wearing the hat from quot the message quot brilliant stuff 
i had not seen the tv series this set from amazon was my introduction i absolutely love it i didnt miss the sleek appearance of space ships costumes and alien monsters that we are so used to seeing in fact they would not have been appropriate the core of nine main actors stayed totally in character and did an excellent job if you enjoyed this series i highly reccomend also getting serenity although it is a good story by itself it does tie up some loose ends from the firefly series such as why the alliance was so obsessed with getting river back and also the origin of the reavers 
and ive seen alot i use to be a tvolholic but with the reality talkshow vomit that is spewed nowadays i had my programming canceled i just couldnt take it anymore i kept hearing about firefly and finally rented it on dvd it starts out a little slow anything good usually does have to introduce everyone properly then it picks up the pace and it is a very interesting ride i enjoyed it as much as a favorite book anyone who loves to read will know what i mean i couldnt believe this show was cancelled just goes to show how stupid the network execs are oh the sad state of television once upon a time we could enjoy television now you have to do alot of research just to find something decent trouble is after all that research i didnt find anything but i happened to hear of a cancelled show called firefly buy it if you dont like it sell it on ebay people snap it up quick 
one of the best science fiction series i have ever seen from the first episode the characters and story line were compelling and believable kind of a star wars meets clint eastwood but very gritty and credible just cant believe they actually cancelled the series big mistake this had the potential to go for many years 
dont listen to what some people have said about the picture quality of this blu ray collection its very good those who arent impressed are too use to color pops quality like wall e and cannot appreciate tone and mood that some westerns create if your going to compare with the dvd set know that they were low bitrates and cannot give true blacks and lack detail giving a very soft look this blu ray version is the extact opposite anyone thinking about upgrading from their dvd sets should make the adjustment as its worth it to watch in hi def over and over and over and over 
as soon as i left the theater after seeing serenity i headed over to the store to pick up the firefly dvd set what an amazing show that is even better than the movie the characters and fresh dialogue make this show good for those who are not really into sci fi as well firefly needs to come back soon so hopefully sci fi channel will pick it up and air it before battlestar gallactica what a shame this show wasnt given the proper chance to expand its intersting universe over multiple seasons 
firefly has a very goofy premise a true space western that at times is part bonanza part battlestar gallactica but without lorne green yet the show works i recall stumbling on the show during its original airing and being a little put off by the overt space western theme yet i eagerly looked for the show the following week and the next and the next compelling characters are a joss weadon hallmark and firefly is no exception if you are only checking the show out now because of serenity movie publicity i think you will also feel the sense of loss of such a high quality show taken from us after too few episodes 
it wasnt until halloween season of last year that i first found out about firefly and serenity while working at universal studios at their annual halloween event most of us spent our break times discussing our favorite scary movies and other movies t v shows now i know that scary is not really applicable to firefly let alone serenity but both the series and movie came up in conversation on more than just a couple of occasions i had never heard of either one let alone knew what either the series or movie were about i must have kept those conversations in the back of my mind though several months later the firefly series aired on one of our cable stations and remembering how many times this series came up during those halloween night conversations i decided to tape the series and check it out when i had the time well that said i was hooked right from the very first episode this is unusual considering that im not exactly what you would call an avid sci fi fan while i cant pinpoint the precise reason or reasons why i was hooked so quickly i can recall recognizing only one of the actors nathan fillion whom i had seen in white noise while i had never heard of any of the other actors i thought that the overall casting was a great effort some casts just gel while others dont this one definitely did theres a bit of something for everyone i e action adventure drama romance and comedy as for the basic plot of the series its certainly been rehashed in so many already posted reviews so rather than rehash it again im posting this as a newcomer to the firefly series as well as someone who hopes to convert more newcomers better late than never i suppose if you like a good story in the form of a mini series with the sci fi aspect reminiscent of star wars in that its not the type of sci fi that is especially for the die hard sci fi crowd then you might want to give this series a chance it seems the network studio that aired the series back in didnt agree with my last statement as the series was cancelled after only a few brief months that said the fans known as browncoats refused to let the series just die and fade away much to the surprise and approval of the cast and creators whom also thought the series had not been given a proper chance if i had known about firefly back in the day i would certainly have been hooked when it originally aired i have a feeling that a lack of knowing about this wonderful series or perhaps a lack of publicity is why others probably also didnt know about it until recently i am now a proud member of the browncoat family and thanks to syndication and dvds a happy owner of both the series and the follow up feature film its a shame that so many good shows die an early death due to premature cancellation only to be upstaged by more and more idiotic reality shows i want to thank all the firefly fans for not letting this one get away 
this is what i call a realistic sci fi about a spaceship crew who make thier living by any means necessary these are space mercenaries who travel the galaxy battling injustice and committing criminal acts the finest in anti heroes the writing was phenomenal the characters were no where near mr miss perfect thier ship was held together with spit and twine and i loved the space cowboy theme that the show portrayed i still dont get what everyone is saying when they start talking in mandarin but who cares it gives the show a unique flavor and makes the watcher wonder about the development path of mankind that led to making this part of everyday society as i said its a great show when i first saw the previews for this show before it aired i thought it looked cool well i was working that friday evening so i taped it awesome foresight on my part because i taped the show from then on since its cancellation i have probably re watched this series about times plus i lent the tapes out a few times but the tapes are starting to degrade a little so thank you for releasing this series to dvd so quickly this brown coat is doing his happy snoopy dance 
joss whedon and company had another success for fox lined up unfortunately fox killed it as it does so many promising shows 
i was immensely pleased and overwhelmingly entertained by this marvelous television series that i had bought on dvd firefly which aired on fox was not familiar to me as i had missed it when televised about a year ago ah but when i started watching the dvd series i was well rewarded with a purely pleasurable experience the show was remarkably brilliant with great humor throughout the series and interesting new concepts included in this scifi space opera imagine a western set in space and one gets images of dusty frontier towns low slung shooting irons horses and saloon brawls along with space ships and eva suits and that is just what firefly delivers it seemed to me like the story of jesse james set years in the future where the outlaws ride spaceships as well as horses and space suits as well as dusters the cast is excellent headed up by nathan fillion as capt malcolm mal reynolds the ensemble cast includes gina torres alan tudyk morena baccarin who is amazingly beautiful jewel staite adam baldwin primary source of comic relief sean maher summer glau and ron glass and as avidly as i rave about the firefly series i think it is simply terrible it is terrible that fox dropped this excellent series which was a breath of fresh air to those weary of lawyer shows reality programs cop shows and medical dramas firefly was new inventive and clever it was also cancelled and what a travesty it is simply terrible that such an excellent program is no longer available to legions of fans who first realized its greatness and the many who came afterward long after network execs had made the blunder of dumping this show it would be simply terrible if somebody else like the scifi channel perhaps doesnt pick this up and run with it i really hope they will come up with a feature length film and kick start renewed interest in this show and that it will again find a network with sufficient dedication to artistic expression to run with this project all in all i give the thing stars as one of the most entertaining series i have ever seen in my life and i think it is simply terrible that i cannot give it stars well done crew 
i heard about this show after the release of serenity i thought it might be fun to check it out through netflix the first dvd arrived and i watched the pilot episode and i felt like i had nine new friends the cast the writing the whole concept is just so unique and so amazingly good how can a sci fi western comedy morality tale space show possibly work because of a very dedicated man and his crew of equally dedicated actors directors writers set designers etc who all were able to see joss whedons vision of this here verse after renting the first dvds in the set i knew i had to own it i also knew that i would be morally obliged to convert as many friends and family to it as possible i simply cant tell you how much i love this show since discovering it i have been thinking about it constantly where will captain tightpants and his crew take us next i dont know i just hope i can come along for the ride 
i am going to keep this brief since there are a couple thousand people that have said the same thing go buy this show i never saw the show when it was actually on but i purcahsed the dvd set because of all the rave reviews i was hearing and i have to say that it was the best blind buy that i have ever had with all the garbage on television firefly offered something new different funny and well developed purcahse this series now you will not regret it 
its always ironic when the very values of a television show highlight some of the worst aspects of the shows own network in this case fox deciding to cancel this excellent imaginative well acted intelligent and decidedly awesome series smacks of the worst sort of incompetence at best and heavy handed draconian intolerance that the alliance themselves would be proud of what sets this show apart from virtually everything else currently on television is its ability to create a powerful nostalgia for a time when living and sometimes dying free was an attainable reality a sci fi drama that aptly captures that quintessential americanism give me liberty or give me death however the show is not just a vehicle for advancing a political stance its epically entertaining even the movie that finalizes what the shows abrupt cancellation never allowed to develop is lesser than the episodes that make up the first and last season of serenity nathan fillion is perfectly cast as the serenitys captain and gives the show the gravitas that only talented actor can this one goes down in the record books as one of the stupidest cancellations in the history of tv very sad indeed but as many others have said in their own reviews the cant take the sky from me 
if you missed the show on tv now is the time to jump in this is a great series and one that i at least like to return to making the dvd a good purchase if you love sci fi or westerns youll love this series the characters are original funny and smart well not all of them are smart but thats not really the point take a chance on this 
i saw the preview for the movie serenity over the summer of and i immediately ordered a copy of this cult show and figured it was time to see what all the fuss was about i was glad to see that almost instantly i was rewarded for the risk on something i hadnt seen after the pilot episode which takes awhile to get going and almost chokes under the pressure of setting everything up is over the show gets out for a bit of fresh air and really takes off nathon fillion is amazing as captain mal reynolds and has the wit and charm of whedons writing down pat the show is very humurous and has a certain contagious charm i found that i watched all episodes in just a few days because the show is so addicting alot of small subplots are left dangling as the show was cancelled after just episodes actually less but the set includes a few unaired episodes as well but the new movie is the awesome series finale the show never got it wraps up all the plot lines and still leaves it open for more the characters are relatable the writing is great and the show is just top notch a real joy to watch over and over 
from the first show i saw serenity i was captured and became a brown shirt too then i convinced my friend to try it and now shes becoming addicted too 
im horrified i never watched this series when it was on television in my defense it was on a bad night and i never got off work in time to see it a friend told me it was awesome and i should set my vcr to record it but it was cancelled that week a few months ago a friend showed me a preview of serenity a feature length movie that will be released later this year based on the tv show with all the original cast back that he had downloaded and he then loaned me his dvd set so i wouldnt be lost when we went to see the movie wow i was blown away the precept was awesome the characters were brilliant the special effects innovative and beautiful and the cast was brilliant they worked extremely well together and had unreal chemistry the story is about an ex rebel and his friend from the war who own and operate a spaceship called serenity the rest of the crew is a varied set of drifters refugees and searchers the show has a feel that is a combination old west and sci fi it sounds strange but it works beautifully there are three episodes included in the set that were never aired and the commentaries and other bonus material is great after watching my friends copy i ran out the next day and bought my own copy mostly because i loved the show but also to show my support in the form of money to the new movie and the possibility of reviving the series there is hope the dvd sales have been massive and massive dvd sales caused the pinheads at fox to realize what they had had with family guy maybe the same thing will happen here also we have a feature film to look forward to and if it does well this might be a further push for fox to resurrect the series 
firefly how absolutely amazing this is one of my most favorite tv shows i never caught it while it was sporadically on the air but i got the dvd set based on a friends recommendation and loved it i of course had to upgrade to blu ray as soon as it was available this may be the most recommended tv show i make to people everything about this show was golden the stories the characters the settings everything it s the type of show that has something for everyone i ve literally never heard anyone who s seen this series say anything negative about it and that goes for men or women which makes it one of those shows that you can plan to watch with your wife girlfriend without getting in trouble the concept is like an old west show but based in outer space and with intricate character relationships sounds kind of weird when i say it out load but it works better than you can imagine just be prepared that if you watch this you will forever be left with the pain that with exception to the movie serenity there will most likely never be more that is probably the worst thing about this show the fact that there isn t more 
my son tried to introduce me to this series when it actually ran on tv and for whatever the reasons i never did see it back then then a co worker lent me his dvd set of the series and i started watching the episodes during my lunch breaks after viewing his dvd set at least six times in full i reluctantly gave it back to him and purchased one for myself via amazon amazons price was very fair as i was able to take advantage of a discount special but i honestly would have paid the original price for this dvd set as the series is absolutely great if you havent seen it yet do yourself a favor and watch it in its entirety at least once before you judge captain malcom reynolds doesnt appeal to everyone right away he comes off at first as rather smarmy and arrogant after youve become a fan of the series you realize that his smarmy and arrogant nature is both necessary and integral to the core of his character hes not nearly as superficial as he seems at first what can i possibly say about this series that hasnt all ready been said it is nearly perfect and certainly joss whedons masterpiece sorry buffy fans i prefer this series to that one buy the set and give it the chance its due you wont regret this purchase 
from the brilliant mind of joss the creator of buffy and angel comes un interesting mix of sci fi with a western theme at first glance id never have watched this show but after the first episode or two i was hooked im guessing that the western twist probable kept many would be fans from even giving it a try but i assure you this show is a blast i really hope that it is not too late for the networks to get a clue and pick the series back up 
this show had it all a great cast great acting funny and smart with enough action and space thrills to satisfy almost any sci fi enthusiast again fox has proven how stupid they can be for not giving the show the chance it deserved like family guy they canceled a show that had a true and loyal following at least they saw the light and brought family guy back maybe they should give firefly another shot on the other hand i think whedon should stick it to them by make a few more movies in any case a great show and very enjoyable and they movie was just as good well done whedon well done 
great series that should have been continued id wager that fox network executives had one of those oops moments when they let a winner slip thru their fingers 
ok heres how it all started for me about a month ago in the kansas city star i read a review of this interesting looking movie id seen previews to called serenity how cool to see a sci fi movie with a title named after our ultimate goal in my n a group i thought the guy reviewing the movie is gushing over it admitting out loud its hard for him to give a completely unbiased review of the movie since hes a die hard fan of the tv series it was based on up to this point id only heard the title firefly bandied about on occasion seeing it in tv guide hearing the occasional reference to it in my chat room etc about the only tv i watch on a regular basis are the classic series that are found on both hbo and fx the other channels held little if any interest for me so after reading the kc star reviewer ranting about the firefly series implying it was the sci fi equivalent of the second coming of christ i thought id put it on my netflix list and check it out i remember thinking well if its as good as star trek and star trek the next generation ill be impressed god was i ever impressed the tv series box set all arrived in the space of one week and i ended up watching them all in the space of days i couldnt put one disc in and just watch one episode i was fished in like a spawning trout and had to watch the entire thing start to finish hooked hooked hooked i loved everything about this show from the get go the cast it was cool to see the familiar faces of ron glass and adam baldwin but even cooler to get acquainted with the others who were unfamiliar to me very very gifted actors who for all intents purposes appeared born to play these roles i could rant about them all individually but id be sitting here for another hour you get the message the acting matter of opinion here but i think they pulled it off effortlessly they became their characters in the fashion of true method actors when actors make their jobs look completely natural and effortless they are achieving their goals magna cum laude the stories they pull you in immediately the same way stephen king and others like him pull you in right from the first few pages instead of taking forever with plot set up and character study some of the more cynical among us would argue that the stories got a bit corny on occasion to that i would argue hey even the best sci fi tv shows and movies would occasionally tread into that territory i have yet to forgive the next generation series for coming up with the episode where data tried to become a stand up comedian with the help of joe piscopo or in the original star trek where they took on the group of outer space hippies sometimes corniness can be the right kind of comic relief at the right time within a story whether it works or not is subject to anyones opinion personally i dont think they ever crossed the line where that was concerned the humor in the stories was a godsend and the vast majority of the time very well done and thought out and as i stated in my review of the movie it was even more pronounced throughout the movie i could go on about other nuances of the series that grabbed me or tell you about my favorite episodes but after previous reviews of this series youve gotten the message allow me to share this with you though after spending days last week watching the series non stop on dvd i was chomping at the bit to go see the movie i checked the newspapers to see if it was still showing anywhere here since it had been playing for about a month at the time thankfully it was still showing at one theatre quite a distance from where i live and it goes without saying that it was worth the time distance to get to see a truly fantastic movie thank you joss it was the showing that evening and just imagine my surprise when i walked into the theatre to find it nearly packed i thought id actually walked into the friday night premiere of jarhead or something walked up to the top row found a seat and asked the girl next to me if this was the theatre for serenity she said it was no way in hell was i expecting to see that many people in the theatre that night considering the movie was on its last run before hopefully hitting the dollar houses hard to describe the feeling that went through me as the lights went down and the movie started up corny as this might sound to some there was a real feeling of camaraderie of family like i was part of a large group of like minded people of greater than average intelligence who know quality when they see it im sure i dont have to tell any of you by now what a rush the movie was or how its one of the few movies ive seen in recent memory that i would pay to see again as has been stated by other reviewers we can hope that the suits at fox have learned a lesson by pulling the plug on a series that deserved to survive cant help wondering if the fx network might learn a similar lesson now that ive heard that over there has been cancelled id like to believe that this series will be remembered for ages to come for its quality its humor its depth its humanity they dont make em like this anymore and i feel blessed to be a part of the firefly serenity community 
the series was painfully short but here it is in its entirety if you are a fan you owe it to yourself to own this 
great sci fi series and definitely worth your time to see if you love joss whedon he does not let you down good storyline and great action 
it seems uncanny that one of the best sci fi television serials since star trek would also be the downfall of sci fi television which even ended up with star trek being cancelled the reason why we dont have anything new these past few years is apparently because of the low ratings sci fi television has been receiving with episodes produced and only aired firefly was cancelled by fox in december however cult dvd box set followings yeah this one caused fox to produce a movie version of the firefly series called serenity firefly is a cross between star wars and the magnificent seven the shows creator josh whedon of buffy the vampire fame had finished reading books about the battle of gettysburg and the american civil war combined the immigrant colonization elements with space pirates a spice of whedon whit in the script and a renegade crew on the ship serenity with some state of the art special effects lucas could be forgiven for believing that his beloved ilm had been working early mornings without his knowledge delivering on some cool stories for a show that deserves all the hype it has been receiving in short if you own a dvd player got the price for any box set you will be getting value for content and then some more this is like hours worth of some of the best sci fi you will ever see along with some of most hip characters to grace the television screen the stories are all downright fab get it and tell people about it serenity pilot which established the crew and serenity the train job great cargo heist space train robbery with a twist bushwhacked reavers shindig malcom has a duel with inaras date safe critical situation finds mal choosing which crew members will live and which will die our mrs reynolds very funny episode with mal finding himself married great plot twist jaynestown jayne discovers he is a local folk legend out of gas a dark flashback episode about survival ariel the serenity crew try a medical heist ariel is analysed war stories mal and wash are tortured by the sinister niska trash saffron returns for a weapons heist the message an independence soldier smuggling goods knows mal and gets his crew into trouble heart of gold wild west style shoot out in a brothel objects in space a weird and zany bounty hunter called early tries to kidnap ariel 
as a general rule i avoid television like the plague were one to write a two hour movie for television it would necessarily appear in the format of a seven act play would that be because the seven act play is the reference point for a quality plot structure no its because on commercial television your story is going to be interrupted six times for the purpose of selling corn flakes and underarm deoderant that compelling storytelling could come forth from such limitations should make anyone pause and appreciate what he or she seeing such is the nature of joss whedonsfirefly the complete series blu ray the unifying premise of firefly appears to have its roots in the american civil war having won a very similar war for very similar reasons decisively in the final battle in the serenity valley the alliance has forcibly united the whole of humanity the captain of the firefly class cargo ship malcolm reynolds was a separatist who fought on the losing side of said war abandoned by his allies in that very last battle unwilling to pledge his undying loyalty to the alliance he eeks out a meager existence smuggling contraband for hire or any other job he can manage to arrange with the shadowy figures with whom he is often forced to work technological wonders do exist in this future vision of mankind but as seems always the case one must have the means to pay for such extravagance when paying jobs become scarce then captain malcolm reynolds has to make due with ferrying passengers from one place to another hence the growth of his crew aside from the core members to navigate repair or provide brute strength so the captain can get a little shut eye in relative peace in a lesser series most of these characters would provide either plucky comic relief or function mostly as an archetype to bring the focus back onto the protagonist but here every character is a protagonist even the anti hero jayne cobb who only barely qualifies as an anti hero early on in the story arc the strength of this show is a great premise coupled with fantastic character development it is a real shame that fox could not find it in their cold eyed bean counting hearts to let this run for a season or two especially since joss whedon had already proved himself with two other successful series the filmserenity blu ray was forced to tie every loose end of the unfinished series together in its somewhat rushed narrative while i do like the film it should have been a trilogy given all the story arcs the series initiated if i had it to do all over again i would film a trilogy that renders a definitive vision of the television series but serves as a prequel to the film funded and distributed by universal there were a lot of questions left unanswered by the series for instance just how and why does malcolm reynolds lose his faith this is an interaction between mal and the shepherd that we never got to see but should have also what if inara chose men with whom she would not sleep out of a love for mal the virgin she is hired to bed may have needed her kindness more than her body why not explore that possibility but these questions linger primarily because the series never got the backing it both needed and deserved the untapped potential of this concept remains staggering as a side note the blu ray of the film is fantastic the series was intentionally filmed for a grainy look to coincide with the western genre so that blu ray will hit the point of diminishing returns when those scenes appear ill get the blu ray of the series just out of loyalty to the cast and crew but it is not the stellar blu ray that the film is 
to be honest when i first heard of quot firefly quot i intended to ignore it not because it wasnt a cool concept which it was it was because the majority of the advertisements and the like tended to focus on the fact that this show was created by the same guys who did quot buffy quot and quot angel quot i hated those shows with a passion so i didnt watch a single episode of it when fox had it on the air despite the good reviews and fan reaction it got then finally it went away i stopped hearing about the show and put it out of my mind i figured that if it got cancelled after one season it wasnt worth it however i kept hearing about angry fans writing letters even raising money to try to keep the show on the air finally i gave in i heard so much good things i just went online to this fabulous site nonetheless and bought it right out no renting no borrowing just bought it im glad i did quot firefly quot is one of the best shows ive ever seen and even more evidence although there is an abundance of this already that the execs at fox all have some kind of mental problems when it comes to keeping perfectly good shows quot firefly quot is essentially sci fi spaceships space battles and the like combined very effectively with old western type style gunfights dialogue and just an overall visual style it doesnt sound quite right on paper but in motion it is a wonder to behold it kept bringing me back to my younger days watching old cowboy movies with my dad and then yanking me back with some nice sci fi type action it blends these elements beautifully and never seems to trade one side for the other i e not more sci fi than western or vice versa at any given moment the writing is some of the best ive seen the special effects are worth of any movie this means you lucas and the characters are well acted and well crafted the only problem with this disc set is that it really does leave you wanting more and its not the shows fault fox needs to seriously reconsider bringing back the show or at least giving the rights to someone else sci fi channel anyone the set comes with some nice special features including commentary on a few episodes a gag reel some deleted scenes and some behind the scenes features that were made after the sad cancellation of the series so everyone cast and crew has an opinion about it which is kinda nice to know if you consider yourslef a fan of sci fi and are looking for something really unique pick this up the way i see it the more people buy this the more money fox gets to consider reintroducing the show suddenly that forty bucks seems to be going towards a good cause doesnt it we can only dream i suppose but with a movie rumored to be in development and a possibility for someone like sci fi channel to pick up the show sometimes dreams dont seem that far fetched 
cleverly written scripts and very entertaining i cant imagine why this series was on the hit list i originally purchased this series as a gift for my son and have since watched it with him you dont have to be a sci fi fan to enjoy this series only someone that yearns for some really fun entertainment and a good ride 
firefly depicts the adventures of captain malcolm reynolds and his crew on board the ship serenity after they picked up two fugitives on the run from the totalitarian government known as the alliance it really is a show you have to stick with for the first disk or two but it more then well pays itself off by the third disk with its western like hold ups futuristic setting and cleverly plotted missions and tasks this show is almost like a hybrid of star treck bonanza and the a team except a whole lot better cancelling this show might have been foxs worst mistake it is funny clever exciting and suspenseful firefly is an excellent purchase and a steal 
firefly is great quality on blu ray despite some of the negative reviews i view on a ft projected picture and the differance to the dvd is way above get the blu rayhighly reccomended
theres not much to say that almost people havent said before me about how great this series is alternately hilarious and heart wrenching and not always where you most expect it brilliantly written impeccably acted by nine people who make you care deeply about each character beautifully designed photographed and directed in a word inspired and possibly the best series that has ever appeared on television im sorry it took so long for me to believe a friend and buy the dvds thank you serenity which finally pushed me over the edge and now like so many others im evangelical on the subject of firefly even if it stretches my christmas budget everyone who might conceivably be interested is going to get a copy keep the chain going reach critical mass and the powers that be might bring it back 
i dont know where i was when this came out on tv but i never saw it back in i guess i was watching tgif comedies on abc my mistake i only discovered this series after watching the serenity movie also five star entertainment so to cut to the chase ill just throw my vote in with those reviewers who give this dvd box set five stars entertaining hours of action adventure humor and drama dvd extras are interesting and give some insight into the actors and directors thoughts on the show and characters quality packaging in four slim line cases inside a slip case box not the usual low grade multi set packaging which results in scratched discs well worth the price of admission 
the background story of the dissolution of firefly is as interesting and heartbreaking as the pilot episode and worth investigating joss whedons firefly series was abandoned by its network before completion and ignored the developing fan base that population was strong enough to support and justify the development of the serenity movie thanks to joss his backers and their incredible team the loss of this great concept tv series is soothed by the success of its actors in other series e g castle v numb rs chuck this delightfully written filmed and acted western is a believable and barely predictable tale of thieves whom we grow to admire for their tenacity in uncertain times joss tips his hat to shakespeare homer chaucer plato socrates xiang yu and other eastern philosophers in wit and rationale each episode is a well considered gem sufficient to admire alone but is best viewed in their intended sequence as a graduated string of pearls from which to admire the pendant and last to be appreciated full length film serenity this series and movie alone are worth the amazon prime fee for the repeated enjoyment of their superb construction psychology lighting and well chosen special effects 
its not so much that there is anything highly original in concept about this series gene roddenberry pitched star trek as wagon train to the stars i think he would have recognized and enjoyed firefly what makes firefly a standout in my humble opinion is a combination of factors in the first place the ensemble cast is nothing short of superb in fact im a little annoyed with mr whedon for killing off wash and the preacher in the serenity full length film however here in the series you can enjoy the whole bunch each of whom contributes largely and directly to the success of this series second the writing is really good you hear a lot about good writing often in relation to indifferent work like the sopranos in this case the accolade is deserved the writers give us some wit and some serious interaction along with each story you dont get that paint by the numbers feeling often if at all third the production values are top remember roddenberry fussed over the design of the enterprise even though the network suits told him take a cigar shape put some windows on it end of case the serenity looks real both inside and out the crew accepts and appreciates their ship mechanic kaylee maybe edging into scotty like obsession but is always realistic about its shortcomings ok some hardcore hard science fans may find aspects simplistic star trek stuck to class m planets in the firefly universe the habitable worlds have been terraformed so what and as far as not having aliens a see terraformed above and b the homicidal reavers are alien enough like star trek firefly the series was pushed off stage by a neglectful network that didnt recognize quality when they had it like star trek firefly s fans pushed hard enough to get a full length motion picture im one of the ones who saw the serenity movie first and then backtracked to firefly firefly the complete series has got to be one of the best values in dvd that ive ever found 
over reviews most with positive feedback joss whedon and the fact that the film serenity will be out in november this year this is evidence that this show is so damn good im such a fan of it no its not like buffy im glad for this it wouldve paled in comparison this is a show that cant be compared its a different kettle of fish the only comparison buffy shares with firefly is creator joss whedons notion of the importance of the created family and thats a good theme to run with being a buffy fan i bought the dvds on a risk id only read one review which gave it three stars because it isnt enough like buffy the show didnt air in australia until months after the dvds were released and it was treated as badly as fox here too with timeslots ranging from pm am at night once every three weeks with inconsistent changes so i bought em as soon as i could im so glad i did i lent the dvds to a friend and one disc came back cracked so i bought it again and its a good thing i did cause i still watch the episodes a lot when i first sat down to firefly i liked it but wasnt sure if id love it it was quite fast and i missed a lot of dialogue but by the end of the pilot i was hooked and watched the entire season in one sitting missing all my classes i had at uni that day the fans seem few and far between but this show has a strong cult following theres more of us around that i thought one day i was talking to a friend about firefly and a complete stranger from canada overheard me and told us she thought the show was excellent im excited to see the film the official release date is september th but you can probably catch an advanced screening if its not sold out its not necessary but worth checking out the series first so make sure you persist through the speedy start cause its very rewarding you wont be disappointed and you can join the masses in protesting the cancelling of the show eagerly awaiting the film and the possible re establishment of the show on a better network 
really this has been reviewed to death but firefly was by far my favorite tv show of all time sadly a fifteen episode run and one movie didnt really do it any justice the blue ray however along with all the extra features such as the interviews and the like do in fact do the series justice and are a must own for any fan 
well all these no name actors are brought together for this pilot from joss whedon who would of thought that this failed tv series would gather enough fans to spark attention for a movie version this series almost spells the typical star wars plot with your cookie cutted characters but the stories and characters will entice you to want this series to last forever humor is probably the highlight with irony spelled with physical and social mistakes freud would actually appreciate this type of humor i love the slim pack cases and each dvd has tons of stuff to enjoy besides the episodes 
i saw the movie serenity and i loved it i had never seen the original firefly show so i bought the box set what an interesting quirky genius show a perfect cast an ingenious universe action adventure humor surprises off axis camera work jerky focused cgi shots breathtaking music this show could easily be the basis for a semester of film appreciation class the chemistry between the characters actors is amazing especially the delightful interaction between mal and inara their communication is as much in what is not said as what is said through facial expressions and knowing glances the ron glass shepherd and the river characters are also extremely complex unfortunately their stories are never fully told and with shepherd book now dead in the movie we will never know i have not cared about tv characters this much in a very long time and yet the show always seems to be fighting for its life you can feel the urgency and futility as the shows creators struggled with the network ultimately doomed for cancellation if only the sci fi channel could have taken on the show back in when it was cancelled by fox we can look forward to a movie franchise but an opportunity was definitely missed the movie was great but the mood was different besides i need my fix now favorite episodes serenity the shindig war stories 
a few years ago i was bored and browsing amazons top dvd list for something new to watch and firefly caught my eye at that time it already had thousands of star reviews to its name and id never even heard of the series being a science fiction and fantasy fan i promptly ordered it because if i hated it i could obviously get rid of it pretty easily since then ive re sold or traded the vast majority of the dvds that ive purchased over the years but firefly and its full length companion film serenity still occupies a permanent place in my private collection whats more ive actually watched the entire series as well as the film at least times in its entirety thats a first seems that i wasnt the only person who missed this fabulous series when it was part of the fox lineup created by joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer it enjoys an original premise extremely smart writing and a cast of talented regulars with great chemistry given the boot after only episodes some of which were never aired as part of the original series by some brainiac executive at fox it lives on in perpetuity as a cult classic scifi channel now syfy or some such nonsense often airs the series as a special weekend marathon give it a whirl you may find yourself wearing a brown coat like the rest of us 
i saw the first aired episode of this show two years ago and dismissed it characters enjoying a camaraderie that hadnt been fully established yet and a bizarre wild west in space setting that struck me as derivative and gimmicky so i tuned out as i suspect a lot of viewers did and fox probably used me as a statistic to justify cancelling the show little did i know this episode wasnt the pilot which did a great job of easing viewers into the universe little did i know fox showed the pilot just before cancelling the show effectively screwing any continuity they couldve built for viewers and little did i know how damn good this show was until its release on dvd not since babylon has something this fresh and exciting come down the sci fi airwaves intelligence humor action emotion great f x firely has it all aside from their right wing wacko news channel the cancellation of firefly is yet another reason to hate fox do yourself a favor and watch these episodes then lets keep our fingers crossed for next years movie stay shiny 
in short if you like funny seductive great acting and very well writing stories about a future some kinda rooted on the western past where good guys beating bad ones take a cost not silver fancy costumes here and prosthetic creatures from deep space but yeah theres some laser beams and beautiful outer space background this is for you no doubt the whole universe created for the series is so cool and really a nice watch every time you become so in love with the same spaceship like with the fine female characters just great 
ok ill admit it im an oldster who hadnt heard of this series weve never had cable until this past black friday when it was on sale very cheap and i needed another item to get free shipping i love science fiction i grew up on westerns so the combination sounded interesting and i ordered now im hooked this series is superb it has good character development a good premise a rough and tumble space frontier years in the future and succeeds very well in combining the action and style of a western with survival on an old ship in outer space the premise a band of renegades struggling to survive while avoiding the oppressive new alliance government makes for good conflict along with cannibalistic reavers and gangs of nefarious bad guys sure the serenity crew are a bunch of outlaws but they are really the good guys the design of the firefly class ship is very creative too it does resemble a firefly when the engines light up the stern which gave me my aha moment as to why a science fiction series would be named after a bug my only complaint about firefly is that there wasnt enough of it fox really blew it when they canceled this before the end of the first season had it been on another network one that understands good sf it no doubt would have run much longer 
fox killed this show they put it on in the worst timeslot a t v week can offer they aired the episodes out of order they didnt play the pilot first which wouldve hooked everyone who tuned in they pre empted it several times then they cancelled before it had half a chance to recover from the blows they dealt it they took a sure thing and murdered it joss whedon isnt responsible for the failure of firefly hes never put out anything bad and this show is amazing the writers arent responsible the writing was incredible the actors arent responsible they did a wonderful job this was one of the only original shows to come over the waves in a long time and it was killed by a network that had no idea what it had been given if you watch this show you will not be disappointed if you go see serenity you wont be disappointed this is good art here it just couldnt escape the network bonfire that seems to catch a lot of good art 
this has probably been one of my all time favorite sci fi series while it was okay i was never much of a buffy fan i did watch angel and enjoyed the humor of it so its not that i think joss weedon can do no wrong ive watched everything from the original and new treks to star wars to stargate soylent green highlander etc but firefly was something fresh that i connected to personally im sorry i missed out when it aired and was only a fan after someone loaned me the dvd collection i watched the first episode serenity and thought it was okay by the time i got to the end of the first dvd i was hooked couldnt stop watching it if youre unsure about the series find a friend to borrow it and then buy everyone ive loaned it to has loved it and gotten a copy 
from the characters acting sets and story telling firefly is the best television series ive ever experienced you truly fall in love with these characters and by the time you are to the last few episodes you are asking yourself how was this series canceled if youve never watched firefly you will love it i have shared this with so many friends and family and they have all loved it i still hold a grudge towards the dumbasses at fox for the way they handled this series byt throwing it in a terrible time spot day mixing up the order of the episodes and piss poor advertising and promotion of it this series could easily still be going strong had it been handled correctly 
leave it to studio executives to screw up the best thing to hit sci fi in decades firefly is a fantastic story oriented character driven sci fi western yes sci fi western sounds odd and the pilot is a bit slow to get going but once you hit episode its your new addiction when my wife and i got through the last episode we were really sad that there werent any more to watch we did watch the serenity movie which was a good follow up i strongly fully totally absolutely whole heartedly recommend this show 
firefly will leave you wondering if anyone at fox had any brains when they canceled this wonderful show the storyline is unique the acting is top notch and the special effects are first rate the only disappointment is that it ends this show should still be in production it makes you wonder what kind of idiots make decisions about what to keep and what not to keep one word of advice the first couple of episodes are somewhat confusing but by the third episode you will be able to relate to the characters you will get the premise and you will be hooked dont forget to order the sequel movie serenity which ties together some of the loose ends very highly recommended 
i never was a buffy fan that was my wife and daughter i bought the movie serenity without knowing josh had directed it not a buffy fan it became one of my favorite movies if you can believe it i bought the series firefly on a whim not knowing the connection between buffy josh and serenity i learned after watching the special features on the movie while i didnt like the series as much as the movie i believe i was spoiled by seeing the movie first i believe it is one of the best series that i have stumbled upon i can not believe that those in charge of what stays or goes on t v didnt give the creator of buffy more than one season what idiots they didnt give josh fans time to find it i hope whoever cancled it at least got demoted i cant hope for some to lose their job probably someones nephew or son this was such an error in judgement this could have evolved into such a very entertaining series 
i purchased firefly over a year ago the box is frayed on the edges with tape holding one side i have a list in my desk of all the co workers who borrowed it so far it totals over people if you like the original star trek because of the action this maybe a series for you if you were always curious what would happen if someone ran a brothel out of a starship this may be a series for you 
what can be said about firefly that has not been said already joss whedons short lived science fiction series seizes the most successful qualities from a half dozen distinctive genres and recombines them to create an inventive episodic drama that is nothing short of brilliant the post apocalyptic spaceways traveled by the serenity and her diverse crew with earth that was left far behind contain an inspired melding of cultures lifestyles personalities and ideas whedon has crafted a unique and unforgettable universe one that is so believable and engaging that it seems comforting and instantly familiar there may be something for everyone in this dvd collection fireflys highflying adventures are much more than standard space opera the shows amusing emotional and sometimes contemplative stories call upon viewers not only to look to the future of mankind but also to re examine our shared past to consider history and heritage in meaningful new ways the series is almost always believable thanks in part to some impressive production values the visual effects sets costumes direction and music are perfectly executed more importantly both the cast and the shows sharp scripts are superb firefly is endlessly amusing its true and damned witty too whats most involving about the show however is its undeniable heart as they laugh and cry together you can see that it would be difficult to watch these episodes without becoming emotionally attached to such a charismatic cast the only unfortunate aspect of this collection is that it contains so few installments truly its a crime the series was brought to such an early end firefly encapsulates the excitement and adventure of science fiction the soul and humor of a character driven drama and all of the down to earth charms of a traditional western ultimately however like all great works of art the series is much more than the sum of its parts firefly delivers on almost every level of expectation and maintains the strength of its spirit throughout the series has earned its audience accolades and has already become an unforgettable classic brian a dixonrevelation magazine
i had never seen firefly the series but i read all the glowing amazon reviews and decided to give it a try i wish to publicly thank you all for not leading me astray its a gem of great story telling and wonderful character development really evil enemies and villains especially the reavers to avoid or overcome neat special effects to please the eye plus plenty of extras who could ask for anything more 
okay i may get beaten up for what i am about to say but i must say it i hate star wars star trek stargate and many other sci fi shows when my friends spoke highly of the canceled show firefly i refused to see it i thought it was a rip off of the anime outlaw star when i saw the commercial with river in the box melfina the android of the anime also was found curled up in a similar box but then one friend really made my ears perk up one of my favorite actresses jewel staite was one of the nine main characters on the show i chuckled at that because i first fell in love with her when she played catalina on space cases which billy mummy also helped create and catalina was an engineering genius much like kaylee which jewel plays wonderfully in firefly when i bought the boxset my heart was troubled what was i thinking i hate sci fi shows but it was all for jewel i reminded myself lo and behold firefly is now my favorite show on earth i need more twitches it has enjoyable characters lots of humor drama a little dash of sex and violence plus a plot line that can be followed pretty easily all the characters are well played and i was pleasantly surprised that i actually liked the main character usually i like one of the minor characters more then the boring hero seen in many different shows and understood his struggles with himself his past and his faith i was also very surprised at how cheery jewels character was she usually plays the stubborn but nice girls who sometimes turn their noses up at the world i also liked how the writers made us like kaylee in the first episode right away before she was well you have to find out if you like space drama action adventures dont hesitate to buy it if you dont i say buy it when you get some extra cash like i did believe me you wont regret it i cant wait until the movie comes out i need to see it now o o
this is well worth the money if you are a fan of the series i have the dvd set and had watched it prior to getting and watching it in blu ray picture quality is much better than the dvd version picture is very crisp and sharp which helps in seeing the actors faces and the emothions they are showing you sound quality is good the bonus feature are interesting when you decide to watch an episode for the nd time 
im a newbie to the firefly family after seeing the excellent feature film serenity i had to find out for myself and im quite impressed i got the complete series at a good price excellent investment loaded with humor action and originality this is definitely one to check out no one may read this but i am compelled to get in my stars 
first ive watched a few of joss whedons other franchises on an irregular basis so i wasnt a fan of his per se before watching serenity then i watched serenity and found it to be a great film with very strong characters which is the most important factor in a good story anyway naturally when i found out that serenity basically was the epilogue of firefly i just had to see firefly it was like watching more one hour movies of serenity or perhaps serenity is just firefly what makes firefly special to me is that all the episodes have a very very strong story and a consistency that you simply dont find in babylon or the first two star trek shows tos tng im not talking characters referening previous episodes here either its simply the intensity and quality of the writing that is noteworthy with other tv shows you typically get some or a lot of good stories during a season intermixed by some average and maybe even a bad episode see grey is missing from bablyon for example but never all of the episodes are good firefly is the exception here while the chances of firefly being resurrected are quasi null i hope more serenity films are made and id like to see mal admit he has feelings for inara to her that is before joss whedon decides to actually formally end this great sci fi show supposedly a serenity trilogy could happen based on various interviews with the cast and crew the unresolved romantic tension is exciting but killing me at the same time mal seems harder and colder in serenity than he does in firefly but that seemed like the only change i found as far as character behavior goes this is a show and a movie serenity not to be underestimated if you love good science fiction with a unique western style this is it 
first let me say that i purchased both the firefly series and the motion picture serenity i watched the movie first and then the series should have done this the other way around the third disc in the series had some digital breakup but amazon with amazing speed replaced it with a new set that worked just fine in any case this series was truly fantastic when i say that i mean it was fantastic in every aspect the writing language acting photography sound effects and music came completely together each of the fourteen episodes were a pleasure to watch and left one wanting more when you watch this series it gets you to think about what the series means it also leaves you to wonder how anyone could have considered cancelling a series that could easily have run for four to five more seasons perhaps the series was ahead of its time in that television still had a lot of growing up to do there arent many tv series that contain a message without damaging or limiting the entertainment value of the product this is a series that leaves you wanting more this is a series that will stand alone if you havent seen it i recommend it highly if you have seen it i can understand how you can wish for more 
what a great series this is as stated in so many reviews before me this series now only available on dvd is one of the most original well written most thought out attention to detail having shows i have seen on mainstream television in a long time i was not a huge fan of either buffy or angel either and not to say that i didntt enjoy them when i caught them being aired only to say i was not a fan of religiously watching every week i enjoyed maybe epsiodes total of each firefly i never saw at all when it was being aired on t v agian i say this is an amazingling well created series the detail and originality of this show caught me off gaurd without employing so many of the sci fi cliches this show accomplishes a level of greatness it brings a fresh look to the sci fi genre infusing the ideas of a frontier style attiude i am aware that sci fi and western storylines have been fused together in previous attempts this is the most seamless version of the idea that i have seen i am a science fiction genre fan and this is a welcome and valuable addition to my collection get your copy now as many know by now there will be a feature length film released soon and as one contributor to the series said we can only hope that someone will go why havent we made a t v show out of this and then serenity will be resurrected lets hope everyone focus on that for a second ready now 
to be honest i never watched firefly when it aired on tv i really dont watch network tv in my humble opinion television programming is dead there are some exceptions the trash the networks spout out these days seems to be nothing more than crude rude mindless entertainment again there are a few exceptions a friend of mine recommended firefly when it was first released on dvd i was hesitant i had tried other popular sci fi shows on tv and i came away disappointed every time i realize that many of these shows have a large fan base and i mean no disrespect to these people but i just felt that these shows were garbage well i finally rented disc one of the firefly dvd set after watching the first disc i immediately returned it and didnt bother renting the second one i simply ordered the entire boxed set this is a thoughful intelligent entertaining and character driven show the special effects are very good the casting is superb the dialougue is witty and intelligent the stories are unique and fun and even the costumes are brilliantly conceived i instantly fell in love with the crew of serenity and eagerly looked forward to each episode this is a brilliant show so what does that mean well the network executives will have to cancel it of course yes the series did suffer from low ratings but after doing a bit of research i found out that the network insisted on airing the episodes out of order this lead to viewers not fully understanding what was going on since they were not aware of some of the back story and previous events that had happened to the characters well thats a network executive all over paid a rediculous salary to make really bad decisions for the general public where can i sign up for a job like that just kidding i would never stoop so low the dvd sales of the firefly series speak for themselves had this show really been given a chance it would still be on the air today regularly pulling in a sizable portion of ratings and the executives i bad mouthed a moment ago would be lining their pockets with oodles of cash but at least the viewing public would be happy if you like sci fi please check this show out you will not be disappointed the show itself is great but so are the extra features the gag reel is hilarious if you love sci fi just spend the money on the boxed set now and dont bother renting you will thank me 
a lot of people say a movie or series is good or bad ill just say i like it it is enjoyable and fun while actually dealing with some serious issues i had never seen the series when it was on tv but someone we knew told us it was really good so when amazon had the blu ray version as a deal of the day i looked at the other reviews and figured why not im glad i did i never expected to enjoy a space western but you can sit back turn your brain off and just enjoy the unusual situations the banter and action if i had to describe the series id say it was star trek meets hitchhikers guide to the galaxy meets bonanza but with a light breezy feel to it the combination of characters is unique as are the situations they find themselves in as i said in the title its fun considering that things filmed for tv dont always lend themselves to the the quality blu ray is capable of this version has very good but not necessarily great video characteristics the audio is extremely good 
the history of television includes many shows that were magnificent that didnt start out as ratings monsters but some were given the chance to succeed cheers was one star trek tanked in the first season and only caught on only because the network gave it a chance to succeed giving it two more seasons now its a franchise firefly is right up there with the best television that ive ever seen and i have to wonder what the suits at fox were thinking or smoking or not to pull the plug on this one this is some of the best writing and near perfect ensemble casting that you will find edgey witty funny very cool and all i can say is i am glad that fox at least had the good sense to put this on dvd this is brilliant stuff and all id say to its writer director joss whedon is that police squad tanked on tv and went on to be a film monster with leslie nielsen bringing life to david zuckers writing and directing i hope the same fate awaits joss whedon he certainly deserves that kind of success 
i have never even heard of this show until about two weeks ago im so glad its out on dvd because its one of the best shows that i have ever watched on television im a fan of science fiction such as the x files and stargate sg and they have firefly classified as science fiction and i guess technically it is but its really more of just an action comedy set in the future because its not real heavy on the science part all of the characters are great and would have loved to see each one in three or more seasons but thats not going to happen some of my favorite episodes areserenity parts and the train jobbushwackedshindigsafeour mrs reynoldsjaynestownout of gasarielwar storiestrashthe messageheart of goldobjects in spaceoh i guess that would be the entire set 
firefly will go down in history as the example of how the race for ratings can end a splendid show the writing the acting the plotting the entire package is there and it excels the show never fails to thrill i have lent out my copy and referred many to rent it and without exception the response is always quot why did they cancel this show quot buy this set for your collection and hope that the movie being developed causes a resurgence of interest in this splendid series 
joss whedon is something of a living legend hes got a career that makes a lot of people envious including me he gets to create compelling worlds inhabited by characters we care about and he gets to do it on his terms relatively speaking on top of that hes very gifted storyteller and he keeps getting better firefly is the culmination of all of the knowledge tricks experience and skill that hes learned in his career at that point and it really shows firefly has an impeccable ensemble cast tight writing and directing and a very creative premise the chemistry and dynamics between the ensemble cast is what makes firefly shine the kind of magic firefly radiates transcends its science fiction roots and secures a place in the history of television as one of the finest tv shows ever created its not a surprise that such a fine show got canceled so quickly weve seen this kind of thing happen before remember my so called life idiotic shows that appeal to the lowest common denominator stay on the air for years while a masterpiece like firefly gets canceled before reaching the end of one season but as we all know already there is no justice in this world 
i agree that this show was the best sci fi on television since the original star trek and probably even better watching the extras on the last disc reveals even more just imagine how good this would be without the constant tweaking demanded by the network pinheads at fox joss whedon tells about the changes the network was always pushing for with the show and despite his efforts to appease them they cancel it anyway how come all the good shows die young about a decade ago about the only show i would watch on tv was the wonderfully entertaining brisco county jr also quickly cancelled by fox like firefly it had stand alone episodes but a steadily advancing plot with reoccurring characters and was marvelous so much of television even with channels is assembly line so what would you call network executives at the bottom of the ocean a good start 
well i may have missed the initial party but its never too late to become a browncoat i am proudly displaying my browncoat beside the suits of the federation earth alliance and the commonwealth i will let you savvy tv sci fi fans figure out which show belongs to what suit this joss whedon treasure is as surefire winner from the brilliant writing to the direction to the wonderful ensemble cast as any of the aforementioned shows were the only difference between those and this show is this one was cut off in its prime after only eps including the hour pilot the show faded to black three shows were filmed and left unaired but have thankfully found a home in this set star trek was originally compared to being a wagon train like show set in the future well firefly takes the wagon train element and brings it more literally to life than star trek ever did there are horses wagons six shooters rifles cattle cowboys all the things a good western needs and more the shows premise harkens back to the us civil war where the union fought the confederacy here referred to as the alliance against the independents the lead characters consider themselves all members of the latter the firefly class ship it actually is reminiscent of said insect is called serenity so named after the famous battle of serenity valley which two of the lead characters fought through and barely survived it was the battle that ended the war between the two factions the ship and crew now do odd jobs for odd characters going where the pay takes them and generally trying to steer clear of the alliance what sets this sci fi series apart from its competitors is the decided lack of aliens this series focuses more on the human factor that is our own progression out into the galaxy and our colonization of it goodness knows there is enough writing fodder to be had concentrating solely on humans without having to add the alien dynamic into the mix and joss whedon successfully does just that the cast was a dream cast everything gelled perfectly they were nathan fillion as malcolm reynolds gina torres as zoe alan tudyk as wash morena baccarin as innara adam baldwin as jayne jewel staite as kaylee sean maher as the dr tam summer glau as river and finally ron glass as book glass is well known from barney miller and gina torres is one of my fave kick butt type characters from xena hercules and cleopatra the characters were brought vividly to life by each actor and each had their own back story to tell which fleshed out the entire feel of the show the entire set of eps in this dvd set are in w s format clear and crisp for the most part and there are oodles of extras for all those dedicated browncoats out there such as a featurette on the making of the series the ship deleted scenes a gag reel and more i never saw the original series in its original airing the only one out of the aforementioned others if you have successfully guessed by now which ones they are i didnt but i heard alot about it and its premature demise the first thing i ever saw of firefly was the movie serenity see my review on that and loved it i did not know then about the back story but now having viewed the original series it all comes beautifully into focus this set of four single sided discs is da bomb believe me this series will show you what intelligent tv writing can do and whedon is to commended for his vision on this project whedon killed off some of the shows characters in the movie but there is no reason a renewed series couldnt just pick up where the original left off with all the same people and have the movie as the final fade out of the series once it is done but that takes vision and guts on the part of tv execs which unfortunately is sadly lacking when they see shows that dont neatly fit within their prescribed parameters well the ever swelling ranks of browncoats just added one more enthusiastic member i urge you to buy this set and guarantee after you watch it you will be joining up too 
this is great storytelling the characters are fleshy gritty real raw and lovable the effects are beautiful and the acting is excellent perfect for fans of epic science fiction worth every penny after a few episodes youll be hooked 
if one ever had cause to doubt the wisdom of those in charge at fox and are unfamiliar with the absurdly short lived series firefly just watch these cds and have your worst fears confirmed there seems to be an ongoing and massive disconnect between what is great on tv and what is fopped off to the public in primetime firefly never really got a chance though based on the few episodes that made it onto the airways it most probably was going to go down as the finest sci fi series since star trek next generation it had a depth and complexity and potential for development that never really got developed one can only speculate about how good the series would have gotten but some idea might be derived by considering producer joss whedons two other series buffy the vampire slayer and angel neither of those shows as great as they were was especially great in their first season buffy was short budgeted and whedon was still learning how to make a tv series after a lifetime of working strictly as a writer angel was trying to find its own identify after breaking angel cordelia and wesley out of sunnydale but by the second season it managed to find its own magnificent if quite dark identity firefly was excellent from the get go but how much better might it have become had whedon and tim minear had time to develop it nearly everything about this series stands out the special effects are without much competition the most outstanding i have ever seen on tv most of it the result of cgi scripting rather than modeling though models are used as well just how spectacular the effects could be could be seen early on in the episode the train the serenity the space freighter used by the shows protagonists soars down over a hyper speed freight train and hovers over it while one of the crew is lowered on a rope to one of the cars where two other crewmembers have extracted cargo for the purposes of theft the sequence is simply stunning even by feature film standards luckily there is more to firefly than special effects one cant conceive a joss whedon show without great writing and a complete eschewal of the hackneyed and stereotypical whedon is the finest chain puller in the history of tv writing and just when you think a show is becoming predictable the entire storyline will shift into completely original and sometimes shocking terrain whedon is also a master at both short and long range story arcs and thanks to the brain trust at fox we didnt get to experience the long range story arcs the cast is absolutely first rate and one of the great tragedies in the show ending as quickly as it did was losing the opportunity to get to know these folks better just as the relations between the cast members were getting really interesting another hallmark of a whedon production fox pulled the plug nathan fillion showed that he had the presence to be a charismatic lead character as captain mal reynolds former fighter against the federation on the side of the independents now a rogue who takes on all kinds of odd jobs as long as it never hurts everyday folk gina torres is a familiar face from movies like the matrix reloaded and guesting on tv shows like angel hercules and alias and was great here as the ships number two with alan tudyk playing her slightly under her thumb in a cute way husband and ship pilot adam baldwin is great as cobb the ships resident tough guy and muscle the incredibly stunning marena baccarin plays inara serra a registered companion i e a very high class prostitute along the lines of accomplished educated sophisticated courtesans who is clearly in love with reynolds despite her coolness her role is remarkable in that she is not portrayed as being at all sleazy in fact she is the ships most respected passenger being treated with inordinate deference wherever they travel jewel staite is kaylee the ships mechanic and ron glass the ships chaplain he describes his role as that of giving guidance in an area where things are often confused and lacking in moral order finally the crew is rounded out by sean maher who plays the ships doctor and summer glau who plays his mysteriously gifted sister river who is desperately sought by the alliance clearly river was the character who would have caused some of the most interesting plot developments had the series continued fans of firefly have had in recent months two great pieces of good news the first is that not only the episodes originally shown on fox will be shown on these dvds but three previously unseen episodes the latter along would justify the cost of the discs but recently we have had what is potentially an even greater piece of news joss whedons next major project is going to be a full length feature film of firefly and he hopes to bring the entire cast of the tv show into the film of course this creates fantasies of the show being revived on a different television network but at the very least it means that we have the dvds of this great great series and a forthcoming film to help us over our hurt 
i just dont get it how does a ceo keep a job after dumping firefly seems like all they care about there anymore is crappy animated shows cant wait for the next movie fly on serenity 
science fiction and the western two genres that were featured in the great television series of the fifties and sixties firefly combined the best elements of the western and science fiction shows creative story telling wonderful believable characters and a sense of humor add to that one of the best ensemble casts since hill street blues note when is that show going to make it to dvd and you have a really terrific series it certainly should have gotten better treatment from the fox network evidently rupert murdoch and his merry band thought that joe millionaire was more intellectually stimulating entertainment well this is the same group that sued al franken over fair and balanced so what else could we expect at any rate its great to be able to enjoy firefly again especially the lost episodes and the interesting audio commentary i cant help wondering if the show had been on wb or upn perhaps we might be enjoying new episodes of firefly this season 
this is one of those shows that suffered from lousy promotion and impatient network execs it should have been saved just to build an audience endearing characters great writing and a very unique perspective of a future full of odd juxtapositions a hover craft traveling down a dusty old west town amidst horses bad guys with cowboy hats riding on horses and carrying laser guns the crew of serenity is a tight knit family of oddballs and heroes joss whedon created a masterpiece and no one knew about it well at least i didnt episodes shown in the sequence intended by whedon all with suspense action character development and humor now off to watch serenity the followup movie made several years later put this series on your watch list and enjoy 
love this show needed at least more episodes to come full circle this is by far the best show that never should have been cancelled its full of wit humor adventure gun fights etc it has it all never a dull moment also has a now very famous director interesting characters from different backgrounds all with personalities we would have got to know them more if the show wasnt cancelled so soon i recommend this show wheather you are a treckie or not you will at least like the show dont give up on one or two episodes believe me the more you watch the more you will want to see 
the serie was superb quality image is super may be for new verison of the br could be better to work on the menu it is not fierndly at all 
i dont usually buy series but this was well worth the money 
this show is amazing awsome it is horribly horribly sad that stupid fox got it cancelled after only one season boo fox the one season they did get is well worth watching and you should buy it so you can watch again and agian btw sometimes bestbuy has it on sale for shhhhh i only have one thing left to say joss whedon more firefly please that is all 
i love this series it was the best ever made wish it never ended all the actors were great want more 
a friend showed me the complete series and ive watched them all more times i miss the characters and the amazingly witty dialogue take my word for it its a delight to watch buy it 
all i can say is i cannot believe this wonderful series got cancelled yet other junk just keeps on ticking baseball games took over when this show was supposed to air and it was never played in the correct order it was designed for so people just couldnt latch onto this well thought out creative and beautiful show my family and friends cannot wait until the movie serenity comes out in septmeber of course we wouldve preferred a whole series run for like five to seven years but getting a big screen movie is more than we couldve hoped for spread the word and give this box set as a gift to anyone who appreciates good quick witted humor drama action suspense and so much more 
i wasnt really a fan of this series while it was on the air i looked forward to seeing it and was sorry but not surprised when it was canceled mostly because for some it would seem too slow paced i bought the series after seeing the movie serenity and came to appreciate how truly good it was im not a fan of buffy and maybe saw most of an episode of angle im still not particularly impressed with either but josh whedon and crew hit a homer with this series it has interesting engaging and well developed characters as well as well developed stories as far as comparing the movie serenity with the tv series it depends on what you like the movie is fast paced and geared toward flash the show took more time to develop a plot after seeing both a few times i find i like the series better as some reviewers have pointed out it has more heart both are above par 
i have not seen the dvds ive been watching it on netflix streaming its hard to believe that this sci fi western was taken off after one season by some moron at fox well written scripts that keep you on the edge of your seat as the ship and crew get into all sorts of mischief strong charismatic characters that you fall in love with and a captain who is as tough as nails but has a soft spot a true leader that everyone on his crew looks up to highly entertaining mixing comedy suspense and drama tv doesnt get any better than this 
here is another show that fox canceled its fate became that of most shows that fox makes it was canceled the tick live action and cartoon versions titus family guy futurama the critic dark angel grounded for life andy richter controls the universe john doe just to name a few fox has made and then canceled more popular tv shows then any other network that has ever or will ever exist on this planet firefly in my opinion is one of the best television shows ever made at first i was hesitant on watching it because i did not want to get into another show just to have it canceled by the morons at fox i gave it a chance though and i really got into it the next thing that i knew quot oh look its canceled quot which is something that i have said way to many times i dont think it was really given a full chance fox never played with the time slots or moved it to a better day they just canceled it this is a great show and is well worth the money 
this was an incredibly well acted well written and well directed series what else would you expect from joss that never got a chance to shine fox as usual had something wonderful on their hands and managed to scew things up which is a trademark of theirs even this single season is able to stand on its own with remarkable visuals and an outstanding cast give joss whedon credit he always finds amazing actors even for background and single line guest stars his direction is as always brilliant and right on the money viewing this dvd set leaves you wanting more which is great as the feature film is supposed to debut in september this series has something for everyone humor action pathos great special effects quality writing and much more it truly was a delight to see and belongs in your dvd collection 
with over reviews its all been said i had never heard of firefly nothing nada then i watchedserenity yes i am a serious science fiction aficionado mostly books but i dont watch broadcast television so serenity was a new story to me great movie but then i learned that it was based on firefly whats that i asked serenity was the reply so i finally got around to experiencing firefly the complete incomplete collection the show was canceled during its first season so this collection even has three episodes that werent broadcast now i know what serenity means as far as the american space western television series you dont get this flavor in serenity but it is there in firefly so ive watched serenity the movie now ive finished firefly the series and next what else serenity the movie again ah anticipation firefly is not an in your face series that makes everything clear in the first episode what was shepherds story how was river going to be outed in the series does jayne ever think of a person other than himself does kaylee ever find true love does firefly ever stick it to the alliance i can just envision the pent up demand for fireflys fans to get their questions answered 
 firefly is probably the first of its kind it seamlessly blends western and science fiction elements into one cohesive whole adding into the mix deep characters and more wit than your average sitcom in an hour long drama series one of the problems leading to its demise was the difficulty of marketing such a show most who enjoy westerns do not enjoy science fiction and vice versa but in this case it just works for both parties its a shame neither gave it enough of the chance for it to survive foxs mishandling of the series but now we have the dvd set all episodes including those never aired are contained within this package not only that but this set is cram packed with enough special features to last you almost as long as the episodes themselves with this and a full theatrical motion picture on the horizon firefly is far from over and even if youre not a fan of the show now is the time to give it a try it was plain and simple one of the best shows aired on tv in recent times it in this reviewers humble opinion surpassed even joss whedons other creations with higher believability better characters and wittier dialogue the dialogue in fact has not yet been matched by any show i have ever seen and ive seen a few if youre a firefly fan buy this box set if youre not a firefly fan buy this box set and become one you wont regret it 
well what can i say firefly is a shiny jewel in a sea of reality tv garbage when i see the mindless junk on tv today it seems insane for fox to have treated joss whedons firefly the way they did it seems that the fox executive who made the decision to reject the original pilot show the episodes out of order and then cancel the series was a hwoon dahn firefly has grown to be unstoppable the show is simply awesome after watching the last episode on the fourth disc i wanted more i now have this empty space in me that only more of the firefly verse can fill this show could easily have made seasons worth of great episodes fans of firefly see the awesome potential that this show had and still has i love firefly and serenity the movie heres my plea to joss and any network or studio please bring firefly back or at least make another movie personally i would rather have the tv show back what would it take to bring it back may not have been the winning side still not convinced it was the wrong one 
this series is a sleeper i never knew it was on fox and it got cancelled before i saw a single episode but when the series came out on dvd i took a chance and was i surprised it is excellent top of the line good story lines solid supporting cast the episodes seemed to be getting better and better and then they cancelled it man why do they always cancel the good ones and the bad sitcoms go on and on go figure anyway i have watched all but one of the episodes so far and every one has been excellent im a science fiction buff from when i was a kid and this one is a keeper 
theres point in glorifying it firefly the series rocks and if you dont have it in your collection youre missing out oh and bonus this actually included the series pilot which was unexpected and with which i was unacquainted 
it will be missed the dvd set gives you a lot of things we didnt get on fox shows in order lots of behind the scenes etc if you liked the show you should own this 
 but i just want to pitch in my bit and say really this is my favorite things in the world series im not a fan of television and i really only watch series on dvd these days after meticulous researching a show but i cant quite remember how i decided to watch firefly i know it was after i saw serenity in theaters before that i had never heard of it but i do remember the movie blew me away and eventually i got the series from the library now when i fall for things particularly movies and books i fall hard i mean i glow and rave and go on and on about the stuff and eventually i get around to buying em and look on proudly as they sits on my shelves unfortunately thats all they do for years sit on the shelves being admired and remembered but never watched that is until firefly i just cannot watch these episodes enough since i got the series last christmas ive watched them all the way through times which is a lot for me and i often put one on as background noise while i multi task but that never works because i just end up mesmerized by the crew of serenity once again its hard to explain what it is that casts this spell because im not drawn to either the sci fi or western genres as a rule but all the elements works so well together and just pull you along like a perfect song 
this is one of my favorite all time science fiction series i have watched this many times the characters are perfect in their roles i bought it because it is so enjoyable if you are a science fiction fan you cant go wrong on buying this series i dont know anyone that did not enjoy this tv series i am glad it has been released on blu ray 
i had my doubts about the wisdom of blending western a genre i dont particularly fancy with sci fi but as this show had joss whedon of toy story angel and buffy fame at the helm i had to check it out and im almost sorry i did you get drawn into this series incredibly fast its over far too soon and youre left with an insatiable hunger for more and not just me this is one show the only i think my husband and i are equally fascinated by there are too many aspects i love about this show to list them all but let me highlight a few the settingfirefly is a small space ship smuggling and doing odd jobs under the radar of the alliance the rulers of this fulture world thats how the firefly crew get to meet high and low in the different worlds but most of the time the ship is just travelling in the empty space between worlds just a tiny fleck in the void this solitude yet beauty of space is conveyed better here than in any other sci fi series where the usual impression is that you cant turn your ship in a new direction without bumping into other space crafts or inhabited planets it also puts the focus solidly on the interaction between the characters which brings me to the next point the characterisationthe people aboard firefly are real people with their strong and weak points hopes and fears world views and difficult decisions instead of self important archetypes in colourful suits trying to save humanity from extinction you get complex and realistic characters with very present and understandable issues the way theyre disclosed to the viewer through their reactions to the different worlds firefly visits the problems they face and even more to each other is the shows strongest attraction puntuated by the sparkling dialogue this is really what makes you weep for foxs foolish decision to kill this beauty before it was fully matured i miss the people the lookfireflys world spans from the high tech you expect from a science fiction to the grit you know from a western and both are equally engaging and real to the watcher the judicious use of handheld camera draws you into the world but doesnt distract colours are used to great effect to signal the different worlds the crew move in the yellow of the high noon prairie the blue of high tech facilities and the deep empty blackness of space firefly is an awesome show i cant wait to see the movie and my dearest hope is that the movie will spawn a series firefly is a thoroughly adult show with all the best things from whedons other shows buffy and angel the witty yet poignant dialogue the way the characters inner life is brought out in the main plot the unexpected twists and turns of a great story arc get it at your own risk youll be sorry when its over 
i have to admit when i first heard of this show i just dismissed it because of its premise a western type series set in space years from now i hate westerns and the only entertainment i enjoyed that dealt with space was star wars i was the anti trekkie then one day i saw roswell here on amazon com and went to buy it and saw that there was a discounted price if i bought these two shows at the same time i then figured quot hey its a joss whedon show it cant be too bad and if i dont like it ill just resell it quot well two months later i still hadnt watched it and i was sorta bored so i put it in my dvd player and started watching it i immediately fell in love with the show and was so upset when i finished it and there was no more episodes left now a month later i was searching through imdb com and came across the name gina torres whom i had seen before in angel season four cleopatra and recently firefly i clicked onto her bio and read her other films appearances and was shocked when i saw the name quot zoe quot twice i looked at both titles and was elated to find out that joss whedon is now filming a movie entitled quot serenity quot which is a movie based upon this tv show and he is having all of the original actors in this show portray the same characters again there is justice in this world i know i got off task so back to the show this show transcends the generalization people give to it it is a drama comedy and space show all in one but this does not state how easy it is to love this show even if you do not like these genres my advice is to buy this set you will not be disappointed 
firefly the complete seriesi got around to this series a little late but now i see what allof the fan base is all about and im signing on the studiosstill dont have their ears connected let alone their brainsto something that will be a future goldmine i hate to be one of those who say well at least we have this because i want more 
firefly was a show that was broadcasted on the fox network in the fall of that sadly was canceled after only airing of episodes i sadly missed the magic that was firefly at the time as i was involved in the conflict in afghanistan at the time in i went to the dollar movie theater with a date to see a movie titled serenity i had not seen the television show and did not realize this movie was based on that show when the movie began i realized i was jumping into an already established story line yet never felt lost for one moment i was instantly drawn into this strange new world of characters and their side stories i have to say i tremendously enjoyed the interactions between all the main characters and their conflicting personalities the story line was rich and detailed and kept my attention the entire length of the movie star trek has action yet lacks it it is too technical and the characters feel flat and emotionless stars wars is too kiddie friendly serenity firefly fits the bill of being that adult drama based in the future in the outer reaches of space it feels like how i believe the future really will be for man kind the cgi was not what is expected of a big budget film but were passable and got the job done in serenity it is perfect in the small screen though in its television run as firefly it is eerie seeing scenes of other space and external shots of the ship without any sound which is realistically what would probably happen the movie motivated me to see the entire run of firefly i realized that going back to the movie there were many jokes or references i had missed the first time due to not seeing the series prior yet it did not detract from my film watching experience i was saddened watching the movie then the television series this is a rich world joss whedon the creator of angel buffy director of the new upcoming avengers movie introduced us to i wish that the storyline would continue i wish that there would be a sequel but there will be no more adventures of serenity the movie was not successful enough to warrant a sequel and the cast of the show have gone on to other projects since then if you have not seen the movie or the television series i highly recommend you order both the movie and television series pull up a blanket and bowl of popcorn and make a weekend of it 
dont get me wrong this show is not like buffy or angel at all well it shares lots of the same comedic method but the plot story characters theory cinematography heck everything else is original i cant say enough about this show if you can wrap your mind around the sci fi setting i promise youll love it i know i did 
hello if you are a firefly fan this must be in your collection i love the humor the music the characters the setting all of it if you havent seen it before rent it first or watch the movie serenity which is a great film about the firefly story 
i never saw firefly when it was aired on fox i knew it was there i wanted to see it joss whedon is an amazing amazing creator of stories but never got around to then a friend of mine showed me an episode then a second long story short i own the dvds now we all know the storyline and how well the writers crafted a space western but its the characters of firefly that make this show as top notch as it is every actor has developed a person who is unique who breathes on the screen who brings life to the stories and really isnt that what we want in our tv and movies characters whose stories and their endings are important to us because we care someone else mentioned star wars and how the prequels sucked why because no one cared about the characters the writers of firefly have also created a unique culture of the future even down the nuances of language the intermittent use of chinese which flows naturally into conversations watch it with the cc on there are no translations everyone has to use context to figure out whats being said brilliant and the vocabulary a reader for psychic sly for gay shepherd for priest create an environment that is alien and yet familiar we are disoriented because we are forced to wade through their culture and make a place for oureselves there luckily there are enough welcoming images that its easy to get comfoprtable and start enjoying joss whedon and his team made a product that i shamefully ignored and that got cancelled before its time hopefully well get that movie soon 
its hard to find an entertaining show on tv reality shows seem to be the norm ive found myself watching shows that others raved about years ago i had heard that firefly was a show to watch for its entertaining story lines and fabulous one liners i was admittedly doubtful i didnt know how the melding of space and western themes would work after watching all the episodes i was so disappointed that it was canceled talk about a show with great potential the writing was as rumored great the actors were perfectly chosen if you havent watched firefly give it a go 
admittedly im one of the few who saw the movie serenity long before i even realized it was based on this short lived television series loving the movie i had extremely high expectations of what this show could be going in to this series and i was not even slightly disappointed by anything except for the fact that there wasnt a second season but perhaps the best things in life really dont have to be long lasting the writing is endlessly witty intriguing heartfelt and full of surprises and this is one of the few shows that doesnt overdo any particular thing which makes it great and i would also add that there isnt a single character among the main set of them that i found myself not liking even jane as terrible as his personality often proves to be provides plenty of comic relief and is impossible to hate plan on the title track getting stuck in your head and refusing to leave plan on wanting to revisit each episode multiple times plan on telling everyone you know that they need to watch its that good so buy it immediately 
a couple of weeks ago i was looking for something different to watch and found firefly in the top dvd sellers on amazon i had never heard of the show before i noticed there were over customer reviews i was really surprised because ive never seen that many reviews for any dvd or tv show after reading some of the reviews i was very intrigued and thought of purchasing the show but i was skeptical because i never really cared for westerns although i do like sci fi i decided that for under it was worth a shot and i purchased the set i was pretty well hooked after the first couple of episodes and have watched the whole set this is a really good show and im surprised that it was cancelled many say that fox didnt give firefly a proper chance and after having watched it and seeing how good it was i can see how that may be true if you like sci fi and would like something different id recommend buying this dvd set if you like westerns and sci fi you will probably love this show i introduced my boyfriend to it and he said its one of the best shows he has ever watched im sorry that this show didnt get a better chance on tv and i hope that it can return in some form i was thrilled to find out that the movie serenity which is in theatres now is a continuation of this series i am going to see it today and plan to add it to my dvd collection when it comes out 
i watched this when it was actually on tv and was devastated when they took it off before even showing the entire season or giving it half a chance i was attracted to it because first i was already a fan of joss whedont great writing and characterizations and second because i love sci fi i have watched the complete series on dvd several times and each time i laugh out loud and cry and am moved and want to be part of that wonderful flawed crew if you like great writing with humor and pathos and wonderfully real characters that are not one dimensional then this is the dvd to buy but if you have no sense of humor lack imagination and dont care to think then dont bother 
i first came to learn of firefly after seeing serenity about a month ago hbo signature asia began advertising the feature film serenity in most cable channels here i found it odd that hbo would advertise in a channel other than its own initially i felt that there must be some kind of buzz for hbo to do this i do know from a year before that mr roger ebert gave serenity some good marks but i just wasnt able to see it either because it didnt show here or maybe i just missed it so by hbos recommendations i watched it serenity did leave some good impressions on me who says that science fiction movies need to be high budgeted in order to work so how do i describe firefly truly it is unlike anything ive ever seen while it is undoubtedly a science fiction the feel of the western frontier past and some cultural mixture of east and west have been thrown into the lot its like well its like throwing the carrots celery spinach and the squash all together into the blender while this fruit and vegetable concoction may not be so good firefly on the other hand is despite its flaws this show has a high amount of likeability okay sorry to you browncoats for saying that the show has some faults but here are two or three that i must point out first off i think the actors need to improve their chinese of the time when they speak chinese i cant understand a gorram thing theyre saying and im supposed to understand it living in taiwan and all so instead of being serious about a scene i sometimes find myself guffawing after theyve said their chinese lines however this misfire will mostly go unnoticed to western viewers second since firefly is a mixture of the future and the past it sometimes suffers heavily from present day mentality i really do not know how to explain this well its like the future but with the present day mentality imposed on it for example one would think that in the future security technology would have made it hard for crooks to find a loophole in the system but right there during the episode trash we see our heroes hack the garbage disposal system in broad daylight and in a place that was supposed to be crawling with feds maybe the feds were sleeping or the tracking computer malfunctioned when our heroes were performing their heist hmmm the police sleeping and computers malfunctioning sounds like the present there are other flaws but these are mostly minor things like budgetary constraints and some of the cgi that could have used improvement like the canyon chase in the episode the message far from downgrading the show i point the above because i really wish that firefly gets a second season soon to mr joss whedon i hope my suggestions are helpful firefly has a lot of potential in it frankly id rather choose this show than the new battlestar galactica although i must point out that b g is a good show itself its just that it sometimes feels like it goes on and on in a circle that we get tired of the supposed character development and it has somewhat become obvious who the ceylons masquerading as humans are really most of the time i get this feeling that no actual human have been left alive and that all those on board galactica and pegasus are actually ceylons just waiting for their programs to start up firefly has a lot going for it the characters while these are essentially space thieves and smugglers are likeable enough and never stereotyped its the relationships between the characters that make it work as the show progressed on theres almost no contention between the crew members captain reynolds has one very loyal crew there this is the magic formula that gets them through all their dangerous adventures especially in the episode war stories anyway i guess im just tired of shows that have mutinous crews in them another thing that firefly has in its advantage is its lack of pretension this is the laymans science fiction it totally lacks the technical lingo that is the trademark of the star trek series and while there are no aliens about or any presentation of how aliens live on other planets it does give us a view of what human life on the frontier planets might be like sadly though there arent enough episodes to really give us a larger picture of this the cultural mishmash in this whedonesque verse help make it all fresh as do the script and the witty dialogues theres a good dose of humor thrown in to make things fun and its not dumb as some purport it to be but quite intelligent except when it shows that present day mentality i like the character mr nathan fillion plays as the captain malcolm reynolds and this relationship he has with inara morena baccarin both of them have trememdous sex appeal theres electricity there between them but kept wisely in check overall firefly entertains but to be fair to you reavers out there i must say that it may not please everyones tastes except ice cream what does anyway gasp did i just say reavers shocked i mean to say readers apologies if you watch the show just go along for the ride suppress the critic in you then put it under the sofa and sit on it if you have to eventually theres a good chance that the firefly glow will get into you because it really has that quality not since brisco county star trek voyager and friends have i been entertained like this of course this is my opinion its up to you reavers to find out for yourself gasp i did it again 
i caught maybe one episode fo firefly when it was on and remembered liking it but due to the network pre empting the show i never bothered to try and follow it after that fox did that to a lot of shows then even the simpsons and futurama anyway i saw the movie when it came out and loved it a week ago i saw amazon had the entire firefly series on bluray for cheap even cheaper than the dvd set was so i bought it wow i mean wow this is one of the best tv series ive ever had the pleasure to watch its so unique the dialog is amazing and the sense of humor is awesome it really bums me out this didnt last longer than it did but im glad at least episodes managed to get made judging by the sheer number of star reviews here i bet those responsible for oulling the plug wish they never did that thank you to everyone involved in this series 
what a unique list of characters and a unique series i loved it from the first episode having the whole series is a treat a serious and successful attempt at science fiction i highly recommend 
i just finished watching the last episode on the last dvd of the now cancelled tv series firefly this was a show that deserved to last a while instead we got episodes and a good movie serenity firefly is a space western set years in the future captain malcolm reynolds and the eight persons in his crew each of them individualistic and finely crafted are petty crooks and gunmen including a mechanic a pilot a beautiful companion a preacher a doctor and a mysterious weird child they skulk around the inhabited planets in their decrepit spaceship serenity looking for work and plunder behind this simple outline are deep and dark stories the serenity crew is a diverse close knit mutually supportive group wed all like to belong too they have their warts and they fight and argue but the come together when it matters the set is wonderful the interior of a space ship that looks like it works not a tin foil mock up the soundtrack music is appropriately creepy the camera work is oddly angled the lighting goes from the brightest of bright to dark and menacing the script is clever and amusing homey scenes alternate with quick violence brutality and a fair amount of sex firefly reminds me of the old tv western maverick with james garner maverick was a western like you had never seen before with everything just a bit off kilter firefly is like this watch one episode and youll be shaking your head and saying kinda strange but not bad watch two or three episodes and youll be hooked the story is told at a leisurely pace but plot lines are shooting off in every direction smallchief
 and fox and the general public let him down yes the show ended before its time due to lack of interest by the general public foxs bad decision making and even at least in my view poor marketing to begin with heck i didnt know this show even existed until after it went off the air yes i am part of that general public that let this fantastic show die i am ashamed you will likely read countless reviews here on amazon describing the excellent story the detailed worlds the fine acting okay not but better than most we see on tv these days and the ability to capture ones imagination and make you want to watch the next episode and the entire series over and over again that is the gift that joss brought to us with this series and the movie is this show for everyone no but thats like asking if star wars avengers or family guy is for everyone there is a market for this show and it saddens me that it wasnt big enough for the bean counters it also saddens me that no one else has picked this up and that joss himself seems to have moved on to other projects but alas you can read about this epic adventure all you like i simply ask that you give it a try and rate it yourself amazon helps in that endeavor by making the entire series available via amazon prime streaming not only do you get great fast free day shipping but you get the ability to watch series like this and many others at no additional cost if not here then try your local video store or that big red box or that streaming dvd company that rhymes with wetmix okay not my most creative but you get the idea i can safely promise that this series is like no other youve likely seen it brings together sci fi western action and adventure into one fantastic season series ive purchased this numerous times already for myself for a gift as a replacement for myself when someone close asked for my copy etc and now even watch it on occasion via amazon prime even though i have the discs as you can tell my review is likely biased by the fact that this series changed my opinion of a good tv series like matrix did in the s and star wars did in the s for sci fi viewing audiences but again dont take my word for it just check it out yourself 
i bought this series after watching the movie serenity that was created due to this seriess popularity which i really liked i was not disappointed at all with this series and wish i would have known about it first i love this show and nathan fillion is great i could watch him all day more than that this show has great premise and special effects and action i love the space cowboy aspect of this show and it has such a terrific well put together cast i think if you like action and a little bit of the sci fi side youd love this series this is just a really great show and its to bad it wasnt appreciated while it aired i really dont even remember seeing it advertised 
of course given the cost of lifting something out of the gravity well it makes sense to ship embryos rather than trucks and tractors they weigh less and they take up less space the state of tv being so dismal and the omnipresent advertising so disheartening that i watch everything on dvd i still havent seen the last season of buffy pending its dvd release the downside to this strategy is that every once in a while i miss something i had never heard of this show until the dvd was released despite being a great admirer of joshs work on buffy with his name attached i had to buy it and it didnt take long for it to become one of my favorite genre series meaning that it was one of my favorite series period for science fiction it is almost right up there with the prisoner and babylon and of course they had the luxury of the time to finish what they were doing albeit with a little quantum hiccup in the latter sure hope the feature film is real and gets done 
this series was practically unadvertised shown out of order pre empted frequently and finally canceled before completing its first season why because the network execs had their heads firmly wedged in very dark uncomfortable places ever since it got canceled ive been hoping against hope for some kind of miracle this dvd set was the first part of that miracle the upcoming movie quot serenity quot due in the summer of is the second if you dont see this series before that movie comes out you are going to miss out on one of the best sci fi adventures to hit the big or small screens you cant even be planning to shell out your hard earned money for the next star wars ripoff and not see quot serenity quot can you no ill answer that you cant quot whats the big deal quot you ask ok look ill tell you straight up this is a space western yes there are spaceships in the skies and cattle rustlers on the ground does that sound cheesy well it did to me but then i saw the first episode and i was hooked the characters are so fascinating the dialogue so witty the situations so interesting i just cant get enough of this show literally it could be about space turnip farmers and i would love it the reason for the rustic living conditions is kind of explained and you do get used to it really and now for the good stuff there are no regulations spouting goody goodies here sometimes the crew does the noble thing sometimes not bad guys usually get whats coming to them whether its quot the right thing to do quot or not some of the characters are mostly good some youre not sure about and quot jayne quot in particular adam baldwins character is so thoroughly rotten and untrustworthy you want to kill him but hes so annoyingly funny youd hate it if he were gone i came to love every character even jayne and yet there is always the real possibility a main character will bite the dust the dialogue is so good every episode is like a favorite book you regret finishing thats good writing but hey who am i if i cant convince you to buy the dvd set at least borrow someone elses and watch one episode that should do it if you do get hooked like i did do your part to spread the word ive turned two people on to firefly and maybe theyll tell others most people i mention it to never heard of it thats a crying shame my fingers are crossed for the third part of the miracle a revival of the series on a smarter network it could happen 
hey i admit it i loved star trek and tng unlike most of the reviewers raving about this show but i love this show too maybe more the blend of western and space genres works for me i like some of the cliche breaking like no aliens and no sound in space but what really makes this show work is the clever witty writing and the suberb ensemble cast interesting characters that interact in interesting ways the show is not perfect but close enough for stars 
you love buffy and angel and you have heard of this show which was also helmed by joss whedon and you heard it was canceled and that its sci fi not really being too excited about wasting your money but curious about the show youve meandered over to the customer review section at amazon com now youve met me hello and i say quot firefly is the show that was too good to live quot you wonder what i mean by this and to your excitment ok im being melodramatic you discover that i am now about to explain and i say i was just being ironic i dont believe there was a conspiracy to kill firefly because it was too good its just that firefly was so good it figures that it would only last fourteen episodes and then be axed firefly as i imagine it was the imaginative playground of an extraorinarily creative team of artists who give free rein to their every latent productive urge that could not be expressed on buffy angel firefly seems to have been designed in such a way that almost any genre or theme could be explored in a variety of strange and fascinating combinations that would have been impossible in any other format the show combines its thematic twists genre busting and stylistic conventions into a postmodern brew that comments on the contemporary while projecting it into the future and past with nine fascinating and charasmatic characters introduced in this series the possibilities would have been endless for a show such as this one can only imagine where whedon and crew would have taken this show but faint glimmers are hinted at by a variety of nestled clues and hints it is very depressing that it was canceled but its unfinished nature does not make it to unworthwhile to watch for we have fourteen existing episodes and what makes them so great to watch is the obvious love the artists put into the show and how much fun it obviously was to make i cannot recommend this show highly enough the show was not designed to be a cash cow but as an outlet for the expression of the artisic potentials of some very talented individuals for whom this show was obviously no joke though frequently hilarious the show was created by some very intelligent minds and it does not stupify its content like hitchcock it functions wonderfully on two levels entertaiment and intellectual no matter how short this star burned its light was bright and it leaves an afterburn in the mind which inspires both heartfelt gratitude and the grief of dashed potential 
i was one of the people who loved dark angel fox in their infinite wisdom rescheduled that show to its death apparently to make room for this new sci fi series by the creator of buffy so i was a bit put off by this firefly show replacing one of my favorite programs at the time im still a sci fi fan so i watched firefly by the end of that premier episode which ironically wasnt the first episode more of foxs infinite wisdom i realize im looking at an innovative and well presented program i still miss dark angel and wished it had a longer lifespan but i in no way fault joss whedon and his excellent show firefly for that firefly is a beautiful blend of old west and outer space sounds strange right well take it from me the concept works it works better than it might sound outright the reason it works is because of two things the backdrop universe they created and the well written stories in front of it the back story is rich with history and this show takes a life of its own because of it when the program is over you really get the feel that these people in this futuristic western society is going kudos to joss for sticking strong with that continuity the writing for this show is nothing short of excellent and reaches the level of gifted more than once i think what really makes the show fresh is that you can never really know what the characters will do next you know their disposition and who they are but just about every episode has some scene where someone does something unexpected yet still in character after seeing tons of shows where people actions are so predictable you wonder why you bother watching firely gives you that extra effort this is not a family show in case some of you are thinking firefly is star wars esque every episode has elements of violence and sexual situations at one level or another at the same time the complicated moral delimas the characters deal with can be considered a good thing for a thinking teen to watch while firefly isnt a parents strongly cautioned kind of show i would assume it a pg tv whatever if you are screening for your kids the dvd set is a must buy not only do you get every episode that aired but also episodes that didnt the ones we missed are well worth seeing actually some of the best episodes can be found there the documentaries are pretty cool too the production method is a bit different than what most television producers would decide and i think that makes a difference there is an outtakes or blooper reel in the dvd too its not that amazing but you get a chance to see the actors have a bit of fun the other extras are short but nice enough nothing i would consider dead weight havent heard the commentiary when i do ill update the review considering the price and the quality of the show this dvd set is a steal the dvd quality is top notch too sharp picture crisp and clear audio if you are a sci fi fan and missed this show you really need to check this out its top notch storytelling with top notch effects sets and acting fox has never been good with their sci fi shows only x files got proper treatment from them in spite of the fact they had some other high quality programs which were all treated like dirt firefly should have had a longer lifespan maybe with the serenity movie and the sci fi channels interest there will be more to see in the future heres hoping 
let me explain to you something about firefly this is not for the fans or for anyone whos seen a couple of the episodes this is for the people who have had no chance to know just how good this show is and to them i say this is the most wonderful thing i have ever seen grace the small screen this is the show that was so good that while it was airing the fans raised thousands of dollars to take out a full page newspaper add thanking the creators and asking fox to keep the show on the air that didnt happen not everyone can understand or want to this is the show that makes me laugh and alternately cry it is realistic and beautiful in the way that only things that are real and honest are joss whedon said it was about nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things it is also about the right to be free and independent the story is that a doctor breaks his sister out of a top secret government institution that has been torturing her they take refuge and run from the law on one serenity firefly class spaceship captained by mal reynolds a verteran on the losing side the independents of a galactic civil war there are no aliens in this space western the reason that there are no aliens is because this show is about humanity and all its problems trials and tribulations joss whedon didnt see the need to throw aliens into the mix to create problems the characters are standard fare a preacher hardass butt kicking woman pilot captain mechanic burly ill mannered hardass guy crazy genuis butt kicking girl more of a whedon thing and companion well educated member of the worlds olderst known profession though more of a geisha the actors were exemplarily cast and there is excellent chemistry between them and each gets their moment to shine in which they become more than cliches its a damn shame that this wasnt given more of a chance to be a success like it could have been like it should have been even with the movie there is so much untold story but i the avoidant of cliffhangers who went into catatonic shock at the end of gone with the wind i tell you that firefly as it is uncompleted is more complete than a great many things that just because it didnt get its proper run is no reason not to watch if i valued gold i would say that firefly is like gold instead i shall say that it is like books 
i loved firefly when it first came out on tv im so glad that they produced the dvds i love how detailed the characterizations are the sets are also wonderful and the special effects are awesome especially for a tv series great show i hope that they actually come out with the movie they are negotiating 
firefly was one of the best series that didnt make it not because of the quality of but because of narrow network programming priorities or lack of imagination ive watched the whole series dozens of times and it has never gotten old i know there has been a great deal said about the acting plot actors joss wheadon tim minear brown coats and lots more im sure i feel as positive about that as the thousands of other star reviewers what speaks to me from firefly that i think may be under appreciated is the music its easy to see how the music is so integrated into the episodes the skillful work of greg edmonson in composing and arranging the music is extraordinary if you love the firefly complete series consider picking up the sound track firefly original television soundtrack and the musical contribution can be heard and then better appreciated with the series firefly is great for a lot of reasons for me the music is a big one i hope this helps someone 
i have become accustomed to the fact that anything involving joss whedon will be excellent this was certainly no exception it was clever witty and sophisticated it was sadly too say too quot intellectual quot for the fox executives to appreciate what with the ever increasing quot dumbing down quot of the popular culture and a tale with such promise was just getting started it is my impression that fox wanted joss to quot simplify quot the plot so the average moron out there could comprehend it but joss stayed with his vision and the show was dropped a loss for all of us but bravo joss stick with excellence and you will be remembered long after these fox executives are clipping coupons in their condos you have created in me and in millions of others a devoted fan of your quot thinking mans quot brand of fiction dont compromise leave mediocrity to the mediocre schlockmeisters there are plenty of them out there but there is only one joss whedon are there any impressarios out there with the vision and the financial clout to bring this back 
ive been a long time sci fi fan from star trek to farscape but firefly stands out as one of my very favorites the tragedy is that it was cancelled by fox way before its time i believe fox made a huge error in judgement taking what could have been the next sci fi classic of x files proportions and throwing it to the wind thankfully the movie serenity gave us some kind of conlusion yet i cant help but miss all the great stories that could have been between the tv series and the movie so it will stand as one of my favorites but that will always come with a touch of frustration that it could have been so much more 
as much as i enjoyed serenity the series from which it was taken blows it away the decision to cancell this series was a major mistake all serenity fans will want this series as it devotes much more time to developing the individual characters yes the same actors and characters as in the movie you follow them as they proceed logically from one escapade to another outwitting all comers 
firefly has everything you could desire in sci fi great action acting dialogue special effects directing the whole bag sadly as everyone knows it was cancelled way too soon leaving more questions than answers what about the men with blue hands what is book what is river really hopefully the movie will get a green light if you are in the market for your joss whedon fix you wont be disappointed if you are in the market for great sci fi you also wont be disappointed the set bears up well with repeated watchings and the directors commentaries are wonderful picture is lovely sound is great thumbs up if i had three thumbs 
i was a late comer to the series it had already been cancelled but the fillian touch is gold funny and witty interactions with the cast and the story lines are clever then watch the full length movie serenity to get some not all answers 
this captivating series was unfortunately cut short through its first season of airing fox as they have many times before canned an excellent series before it barely got off the ground joss whedon had an awesome series in firefly with an even better cast the characters in firefly were very intriguing and deep the show was very character driven for anyone looking for a great series to entertain themselves with that is very memorable look no further 
this tv series dvd is the best series i have seen since the early x files on a par if not better than star trek 
i read all the hype on the series after it was cancelled but missed the original broadcast we took a chance and ordered the series out of curiousity and were sooo glad we did my family are all stargate sg devotees and thought no series could beat it we were wrong firelfy has action adventure humor silliness drama and touchingly romantic tension that a lot of series try for but miss badly firefly has everything that would keep an audience glued to the tv for hours foxs shortsighted treatment of the show was a crime we look forward to the feature film and hopefully a more forward thinking network will realize there is a big audience out there just waiting for more stories we really care about these characters and want to know what happens next scifi channel are you listening 
since there are only around reviews stating that your tv should be honoured to have the opportunity of screening this show and you might be on the fence because of this i thought i should contribute the review that will make up your mind and stop all this fence sitting have you ever wanted a tv show that could lower your cholesterol give you a full head of glossy hair and give meaning to your otherwise empty life youre expecting far too much from entertainment however if youre wanting a show with sharp writing a charismatic cast and a wondrous font used for the credits then this is the product for you buy now and amazon will throw in shipping for whatever it costs to ship to your part of the world a show doesnt get this kind of fanatical following from only episodes unless its incredibly good i mean we cant all be family members of the production team uncle joss disowned me so i dont count if youre silly enough to trust an internet stranger trust this one its a must watch 
i dont think theres much i can say about firefly that hasnt already been said i love it i always will would someone please give nathan fillion a job where he isnt under foxs thumb 
im another relative newcomer to the verse i started watching old episodes of firefly on the sci fi channel im not particularly a fan of most science fiction but i had heard too many good things about this sadly cancelled series and when i finally saw it i was hooked from the very first episode i saw which was for the record war stories this series is so imagnative and cleverly written yet it retains an essential earthiness that draws me into the story excellent just excellent 
so sad to see they did not make a second season wish they had made more this season was a 
i am not a hard core firefly fan ive caught re runs on tv when i can find them and i can honestly say that this is from my amateur opinion a good show i personally see a lot of references to the anime trigun the premise seems very similar the artistic choice of combining space exploration and the old west is a neat concept by its creators sci fi element wise this is a little on the light side there are no laser pistals or anything of that nature like trigun the weapons of choice still seem to be bullets also i dont recall ever seeing any aliens i could be wrong about this though i then saw serenity when it was released this confirmed for me that this franchise really was good and also sadly did not get the justice it was due i was not blown away by the movie but at the same time could see the merit in it now years later i would like to completely submerge myself in it and really give it my undivided attention the fact that fan boys are still adament about this series further drives the point home that the networks and studios made a grave mistake canceling it unfortunately thats life we live in a society where people care more about what some degenerates are doing down by the jersey shore thought provoking plausible sci fi shows and movies with great actors are just not in demand anymore for the most part its a shame really nathan fillion who should have been the green lantern is a charming but tuff when necessary captain adam baldwin is a bad ass who also seemed a bit clumsey to me at times in my opinion the whole cast was good as i said ive never seen the entire series but now that its so cheap i will buy this series and serenity and watch it back to back then i can call myself a true fan boy of firefly for me the dvd release will be just fine ive seen no major posts about any defects or anything of that nature so im fairly confident this will be a good purchase for those of you who are still sad this went off the air i feel your pain i loved spider man the series it was canceled and never released completely on dvd in america mantis was good as well along with the he man and let us not forget how great toonami and adult swim used to be one of my biggest regrets is that i didnt watch anime back then when it was so easily available oh regrets good shows leave television and all we can do is move on and try to find new entertaining things to watch good luck in your search most nights i strike out 
for those familiar with this show you are getting exactly what the title says the only thing that would make it more complete would be if the firefly movie had been included for those of you who are not familiar with this show it was a short lived sci fi that mixed concepts of old world customs and lifestyles with the joys of pirating and surfing the universe this show is a wonderful mix of the western cowboy lifestyle complete with revolvers that takes place aboard a ship named you guessed it firefly 
the motion picture serenity though excellent paless in comparison to the firefly series this is definitely a tale for adults the characters are developed slowly over time into complex adults with complex relationships 
ever so much more realistic than scifi shows with gleaming spotlessly clean spaceships that seem to magically run themselves firefly portrayed a spaceship and crew considerably less than gleaming and clean and sometimes less than fully functional and although the heroes in this case not quite on the right side of the local laws in many major tv markets fox affiliates broadcast baseball local baseball games evidently their deals with the mlb call for them to preempt network shows that happened here in the san francisco area even fireflys premere episode got delayed by about minutes of which were commercials so those of us recording the program missed a lot of that episode as well as entire other episodes there are people at fox who should be punished but that is another story firefly is one of those shows so well written that even people who shun scifi my wife enjoyed it instead of being written to a formula joss w took the high road with a great mix of the verbal and the visual im not sure what the budget was but the money was well spent on sets and guest stars favorite episode our mrs reynolds by a hair after seeing it you tell yourelf that i should have seen that coming but you didnt now i we can enjoy all of the episodes without interruption do you think that if enough people buy this dvd set that the scifi channel might consider reviving the series probably not but a good dream to have 
with as many reviews as this series has on line only need to say that this is the best comedy fun drama mystery light horror sci fi ofcourse out there it has it all oh yeh great suspence too and originality you can go on and on
we stumbled across this series on netflix and after just episodes decided we needed to own it we absolutely love this series and wish it had gone beyond one season it takes a unique perspective on the future of space travel and what it is like to be struggling to make ends meet as odd jobs outsiders that are almost always on the run and willing to do anything legal or otherwise to make ends meet it is unique it combines drama with humor with a bit of sci fi and some really great characters if you enjoy the series you need to check out serenity the feature film created at the completion of the series which is now one of my top movies it wraps things in the series up and has some awesome action mixed with surprising twists must see 
 other reviews have already said it this is best science fiction television series ever made firefly which i didnt see until it was off the air was originally recommended to me by a group of serious heinlein fans whose opinion i value they werent wrong firefly achieved in three episodes the level of world creation and characters that took original star trek nearly three seasons to reach firefly has strong shades of heinlein in it in all the best ways read heinleins between planets to see what a young mal reynolds fighting his revolution might be like heinleins great novel about slavery citizen of the galaxy will show you the alliance worlds with their rich and powerful enslaving those beneath and of course youll see inara in heinleins character tamara in time enough for love cowboys horses and spaceships all mixed together heinlein was there long since if youre a firefly fan who hasnt yet read heinlein i envy you you have a wondrous reading adventure awaiting you and i dare say heinlein who was a big star trek fan would love firefly too this richness of world creation with joss whedons brilliance in casting dialog and directing all go in to making firefly the wonderful story and show it is if you like heinlein if you like star trek if you like good science fiction in any form you will almost certainly fall in love with firefly and with the rest of us mourn that it ended far too soon as for whether you should get the dvds versus the blu rays i have had both and watched both on big screen high def televisions i am a little sad to say the blu rays werent worth the upgrade if you already have the dvd set its not in my opinion worth getting the blu rays expecting a major improvement in the look of the video with lord of the rings the difference was stunning the blu ray video was gorgeous a substantial step up from the dvds with firefly its more hit and miss some of the video is better with the blu rays but not all of it and some of the video flaws are more apparent with the blu rays than with the dvds its not a consistent improvement in quality 
 firefly the television series is many things western space opera political action adventure pure escapism entertainment while all of these things make this series a huge blast to watch the center pole of the series is nathan fillions of castle fame captain malcolm mal reynolds as captain of the eponymous ship he crews eight other significant members who are each very well developed over the series and as important are a reflection of the different sides of the man who is mal first officer zoe washburne played by gina torres is a confederate of mals a fellow browncoat who fought the good rebel fight along with him and lost the battle but the fight lives on she represents mals fighting spirit and his notion that no matter how bleak the future looks you look it right square in the eyes and stare it down she also represents his idealism pilot extraordinaire hoban wash washburne played by underrated actor alan tudyk is a lighter slice of life married to zoe and always ready to see the world through a this is sorta ridiculous lense he represents mals muted ability and desire to relax to rest courtesan inara serra played by dropdead gorgeous morena baccarin of recent v fame is a complicated love interest of mals hes torn by her work a high class space prostitute essentially and shes torn by his stoicism and his love for his ship and crew versus herself shes a worldly politically savvy individual and she represents mals eroticism and his philanthropic love he would go to the ends of the universe for inara though he would rarely admit this to her jayne cobb played by the baldwin known as adam check him out in the old classic my bodyguard he looks virtually the same years later is the immoral selfish and brutish grunt of the crew he just might sell any or all of them out for a big enough paycheck or to save his own hide he represents mals raw aggression and desire to overcome his obstacles by virtue of force if not by will fireflys technical and mechanical expertise is found in kaylee frye played by youthful jewel staite who is practically at one with her ship and can fix just about any of its maladies she is also a wide eyed innocent a newly blooming flower taking in the world around her as it comes and believing the best about people she represents mals purity the enigmatic shepherd book played by character actor ron glass brings a little ahem lt color to the all white cast in more ways than one he is the saint among the sinners but the more we know the more we know that he hasnt always been a saint he is also the sage able to dispense wordly and spiritual advice and he repeatedly challenges mal to look outside of himself to the bigger picture and to fireflys version of god not well developed but seemingly close to a judeo christian representation shepherd represents mals godly qualities of being a moses shepherd to his crew and also to his spiritual nature tamped down and ground into the dirt as it is and even doing gods work in spite of himself dr simon tam played by sean maher comes aboard with his sister river tam played by balletic summer glau in his bid to help his brain scrambled living weapon sister away from the intergalactic ruling authority of the alliance who has been experimenting on her and turning her into some sort of super weapon simon is fierce righteously opinionated and loyal to a fault toward his sister river is a glyph a human key to the masked potentials of human feats both mental and physical as well as a fractured tortured soul her storyline is the most distressing and maudlin of the series and threatens to bring the series down a notch at times unfortunately as a family unit they represent mals sense of family and as him being a father figure individually dr tam represents mals single minded determination river represents mals untapped potential and belief along with shepherd book in things greater than himself it is quite the compelling character study and this cast of seemingly disparate characters all resonate and coalesce within the centrifuge that is mal great dynamic excitinga and well written series if you havent seen it do yourself a favor and check it out soon 
joss whedon the creator of buffy the vampire slayer is a genius in his various efforts in television and comic books he has become a favorite of mine so when i heard a couple years back that is that he was investing his formidable creative prowess in a science fiction series i was breathless with anticipation and of course whedon and his long time partner tim minear did not disappoint nor did their well chosen very talented cast firefly is a science fiction western where years in the future humanity has spread across the galaxy united under the totalitarian alliance and its corporate arm blue sun in the future cultures have been melded together to come up with intriguing art fashion and even language the characters swear in chinese our heroes are the crew of the firefly class transport serenity they are malcolm reynolds the captain and veteran of the war between his independent faction and the alliance zoe his first mate and fellow soldier in the war wash zoes husband and the pilot jayne an amoral thief who acts as the muscle of the group kaylee the mechanic with the ability to telepathically communicate with machines and inara the resident companion similar to courtesans or geishas and the ships ambassador theyre renegades and thieves taking any job that pays but things get complicated when they pick up three interesting passengers shepherd book a preacher simon tam a former doctor and his insane sister river who is wanted by the alliance the show is very well written and well directed especially with whedon behind the camera the cast are all incredible but the highlight is nathan fillion as reynolds who is truly incredible on screen but unfortunately by the time one watches all the episodes the arc of the season is just unfolding and is cut short by the fat cats at fox the good news is whedons doing a movie so after watching these episodes go see the movie so you can see the story unfold 
sure upn can let a mediocre star trek enterprise run for several years but you get a new smart sci fi show and the stuffed shirts at fox pull it after only episodes way to give it a chance fox i guess they needed more air time for man vs beast or when animals attack what made this sci fi western unique was that this was still a human show there were no aliens the crew of the firefly was led by captain mal reynolds played by nathan fillion who buffy fans will remember as the evil priest on the last few episodes of buffy the vampire slayer other cast members included adam baldwin as the mercenary jayne cobb and ron glass of barney miller fame as book a mysterious minister they make up the crew of the ship serenity as the group of rogues struggles to make their way taking whatever jobs they can which often make then less than your stereotypical heroes characters is what makes a great show and whedon knows great characters and delivers again with a fantastic ensemble cast all perfectly suited for the varying roles they are portraying not only did fox cancel the show early but they showed the episodes out of order from what whedon wanted but hey thank god for dvd as you get all episodes in all their glory among my favorite episodes are out of gas a flashback episode that details how mal acquired the serenity and how each of the members joined the crew ariel the crew visit a planet called ariel where tehy attempt to get simon into a hospital to use a machine to help river they pose as dead bodies and are eventually captured by the alliance war stories mal and walsh are kidnapped by niska who wants payback for the botched train robbery in the first episode serenity parts is great as well given whedons track record its just incredible that fox didnt allow the show to develop this was really a sci fi show for people who are not necessarily sci fi fans the backdrop was the future but this was a very human drama much the way that buffy was and sucked in many people who were not horror fans or who were older i feel about firefly much the way i feel about another fox show that got a raw deal brimstone stupid fox 
i cant pinpoint exactly why i was drawn in to this series so strongly i guess the number one thing is the characters who are just a lot of fun and well cast across the board after that its the stories which are sort of western sci fi adventures with a touch of mission impossible at times and then theres the universe and the ship setting itself i even love the title theme and opening sequence simply put i just loved this show and im very disappointed that it got canceled ive watched the series times now as well as serenity the movie times and i still cant get enough this is exceptional in my experience i think if they could have gotten more people to watch the show in the first place and give it a chance it might have been something much much bigger 
i dont come from the american culture but i grew up watching western movies on sunday mornings in that sense the wild west is not an unfamiliar setting for me when i first heard about firefly i was suspicious about the universe whedon created how believeable is a place where you have spaceships and cowboys or whatever co existing however i could not resist the temptation unfortunately in todays movie and tv landscape original ideas are hard to come by and firefly is an original concept although the basic premises of the story is really hard to buy horses and spaceships the character depth the pace and freshness of the series is strong enough to keep you pinned to your seat accross the tv the visual effects also play a very strong role in making you believe in this universe i am very pleased to see more and more of real world physics appearing in sci fi movies and tv series explosions in space wont make sounds and there is none the camera actions i was so fond of in the new battlestar galactica are also seen here which gives more strength to the visual drama of the series going back to the characters every one of them are well developed and you like each and every one of them i could not understand the real power of river until i watched the movie yes in some episodes you do see that she has special combat skills but that is just a glimpse compared to the showdown in the movie even jayne gets likable sometimes the romance between mal and inara and kaylee and simon gets in the way of the story from time to time but i guess we need some emotion and i wont complain i dont know how others felt but for me shepherd book is a very important part of the series he introduces a healthy dose of mystery and well serenity into the hectic pace of the firefly i was shocked to see what whedon decided to do with him in the movie dont worry i wont ruin the experience for you just in case you havent watched it what is more you see morality the concepts of good bad right wrong questioned all the time in times of hardship how would a decent man behave you see some answers that you probably would have given as a final point i should say that i am very glad that i bought the dvd set i wish there was more of it i dont know if they will be able to continue the series after serenity but i will be here to watch it if you bring it on mr whedon 
back in being a big fan of joss whedons shows buffy the vampire slayer and angel i decided id better pick up his failed sci fi series firefly my aunt bought it for me for my birthday and i eventually began watching it the pilot serenity runs minutes and i was bored through most of it why had people been talking about this a few months later with nothing else to do i decided to check out the rest of the series oh boy am i glad i did firefly is one of the greatest television series ever a true masterpiece it dares to go where other shows will not something that angered television executives when it was on the air its set in a distant future where sleazy corporations run the many different worlds in the universe mal reynolds nathan fillion captains the firefly class spaceship serenity which smuggles goods across planets while running from the alliance in each episode the crew is faced with a different problem both off and on the ship this show is mind blowing absolutely and completely as with buffy and angel joss whedon provides us with thought out storylines witty dialogue and realistic characters whom we care about the casting is absolutely superb each actor and actress brings their character to life perfectly the show is a science fiction drama mixed with western action and grit greg edmonsons music is unique and entirely fitting it really adds to the emotion though each episode is nearly the same in quality i would say that the best episode is out of gas a moving look at how mal reynolds first met the crew that he and we would come to love the message has received much acclaim due to its beautiful cinematography emmy worthy performances and very moving script out of the outstanding episodes the set contains only were aired before the shows cancellation why an excuse from the network was viewers but can the viewers be blamed the network placed the episodes on friday nights a notorious time slot and aired them out of sequence the network was afraid to do anything out of the ordinary instead they would rather air series like my big fat obnoxious husband cancelling this series was one of the worst mistakes in television history im not the first one to say that it could have been the next star trek with a feature length movie serenity about to be released two sequels being planned and incredible dvd sales this series will not be forgotten but that doesnt make its cancellation much easier to deal with by all means pick up this absolutely fantastic series and show the television corporations what we really want 
i just found this series i bought the whole thing when the price fell i bought it on reputation alone and i must say it is excellent its not babylon or the new battlestar g however there is a new browncoat me and my wife what brought me to the seires was all the hype the fans have put out and the price we have watched the first disc and my wife and i are watching an episode each night or so i am loving it and so is she i will be converting all my sci fi pals as soon as possible note my wife is not really a sci fi fan and really likes the series i am excited because she likes something that i do and we can share it awesome show 
honestly this is one of the best tv series i have ever seen the cast worked so well together and the scripts are funny full of action great science fiction blu ray quality is the best available so you cant go wrong there if you are looking for some tv entertainment without boring dialog and pointless uninspired twists this will leave you completely satisfied even craving more though more will never come tears falling onto keyboard 
i watched the movie serenity having bragged about it to everyone who would listen for minutes i was informed there was a tv series i quickly bought it sight unseen the best move i ever made not only did i enjoy every minute of the series but i immedietly became a browncoat aka diehard firefly fan if you are unsure if this series is for you i highly reccomend you rent or borrow serenity watch it if you give it at least a out of on your personal scale then invest in firefly the actors are the same the dialog is the same even the filming style is exactly the same the series is like an hour long prequel to serenity episodes min each hours total so watch the movie if you like serenity i urge you to get firefly too
this is one of my all time favorite shows the writing is top notch with a great blending of humor and drama while the quality of the drama can come and go i will admit a lot of the stuff revolving around river can some times be tough due to summer glaus not so amazing acting the humor always works even glau pulls off the comedy which really is saying something fillion really makes the show he was destined to play this character and you can just feel the charisma rolling off the man he has that good guy in a not so good world thing going on and he is as ruthless as he needs to be while still having honor its the kind of personality traits you see in great characters such as the doctor from doctor who and he really pulls it off he has made me a fan of his for life the other thing that really helps this show work is the world building the entire universe where these characters live feels real the level of detail that whedon has gone to is amazing and unlike some other shows this one feels like it is set in a living breathing world and how can you not love sci fi western its a great genre that many have been trying to copy since this show came out combine that with really great details like the mixture of chinese and english gives the show a backdrop to play each episode off of is that extra something that really makes this show sing also for sci fi buffs out there having a show with no sound in space is a rarity its a small detail and some more casual viewers may be bothered by it but its a great detail the only really sad part is how few episodes there are to this you can feel he was building to some great stuff that we will never get resolved sure there was the movie but this only resolved rivers story and left so many of the other plot threads swinging loose 
as usual fox puts a brilliant show on friday nights and then kills it before it has a chance wonderfalls we hardly knew ye firefly was the creation of joss whedon the man behind buffy this show other than its snappy dialogue and quirky heroes bears no relation though its a sci fi western about a crew of smugglers and their prostitute boarder a career both legal and respectable in the future who live on the fringes of space eeking out a living on not exactly legal activities they must hide from the goverment and the reivers a pack of cannibals who roam the frontier territories with faster ships and tractor magnets as well as the occasional grudge holding crime overlord captain reynolds and the gang were an honorable lot and only criminal by necessity the cast and acting were perfection the plots were clever and funny and the show was original so naturally it was doomed to fail every episode including a few that never aired are assembled for this collection this includes the pilot fox skipped the pilot and aired the episodes out of order for reasons of their own did i mention how much i hate the fox network the extras include one very funny bonus scene from the quot mrs reynolds quot episode and some commentary there is also an easter egg of adam baldwin singing quot the hero of canton quot from jaynestown mine and adams favorite episode to access it select bonus features on the fourth disc highlight joss whedon singing quot serenity quot but do not select it hit the left arrow then hit select its a shame this show didnt get a better chance if you never saw it and you enjoy smart writing and smartass characters you cant go wrong buy it buy it now 
i am a certified fan of joss whedon that celluloid genius who brought us our very favorite vampire slayer i own all the buffy and angel dvds and even read whedons comic book work from fray to the current astonishing x men but i stayed away from firefly when it was on the air for much the same reason id never watch the original buffy movie i knew it was going to fail just as i knew that the movie would only disappoint me i knew that firefly would not succeed commercially there was no way in this ever more homogenous bush supporting society that a joss whedon show would survive on a network i thought that it was better to stay away than to be left with a huge gaping hole in my side after only a few episodes now after watching the dvd set of the episodes that managed to be completed i cant help but feel remorse firefly and i will take much flak from the whedon community for saying this is the buffys creator best show its better than buffy and angel buffy and angel while spectacular television shows both sometimes hit snags in terms of consistency see season four of buffy and season one of angel for further details this is because while those shows were the product of a concept a cool flash in the pan idea that whedons mind hatched firefly is the show he has always wanted to make every frame and every line of dialogue is the realization of a talented filmmakers ultimate wet dream you get the feeling that whedon imagined every single aspect of firefly long before he ever started typing on his ibook this is a fantastic show it is an absolutely complete body of work although its only episodes long firefly is whedons love letter to all of his influences from sci fi to westerns to good old character driven drama the cast and crew coalesce to help whedon achieve his vision and are all fantastic the way the show is shot and lighted give the viewer a very obvious visual clue about the shows message history always repeats itself nothing ever really changes and people should stop mistaking technological advancements for true human evolution i love the zooms and the quot imperfect quot special effects style complete with lens flares poor lighting in places and various other supposed no nos the staff which included familiar faces tim minear and jane espenson are of course reliably brilliant the sets by old buffy alum carey meyer really betray the shows budget with a very real sense of space especially the ship theres also the actors who i think are just an amazing group of nine very individual talents nathan fillion exudes both confidence and hopelessness in every scene and is hilarious when paired with quot saffron quot the recurring con artist played by christina hendricks the quot strong woman chicken quot couple played by gina torres and alan tudyk drive both actors to play each scene to the nines although i wish we would have seen more of their very complex yet beautiful relationship adam baldwin is perhaps my favorite as jayne cobb the beefy action hero who is despicable but also very much a man child ron glass is the definition of dignity as shephard book whose mysterious past would have been one of the juicest plot lines had the show been allowed to continue sean maher and summer glau share a kind of sibling love that is so realistic with maher taking the role of the ship doctor beyond the confines of any trek glau in her first substantial acting role makes brittany murphy look like a hack with a truly difficult character that she nails consistently morena baccarin in the role of companion inara demonstrates a truly complex feminine strength that is rarely seen on a landscape littered with bachelorettes finally there is jewel staite who never confuses innocence with stupidity and brought much needed heart to the show favorite episodes include quot serenity quot the intended pilot the hilarious quot jaynestown quot and quot the message quot which gives the term plot twist a new meaning quot out of gas quot however might just be the finest hour of television ive ever seen with a movie due out spring of next year heres to hoping that all the bottom line obsessed suits will not quot take the sky quot from us 
this series was an expirement and in a way a succesful one it was to see if joss whedon would have a career away from buffy and boy can he althouth unlike most he should stick to the smaller stations the show itself is about a rag tag team of space luders and the wacky adventures they have it has all of the same heart feeling love and writing of buffy but in a completely different universe only though the show only had episodes it was still a great romp in the wacky mind of joss whedon 
not that episodes is bad well it is since this is a great series i just always thought i missed the rest of the series as to what many people say about it being grainy thats the point its suppose to it kind of adds to the feel of the series trying not to give to many spoilers i got hooked after i watched serenity this is a great series and glad i got this mine was a slim case however not that thats a bad thing but from the picture it looks like its not the slim case disk with added bonus features which honestly i dont watch just the kind of fan i am 
i watched serenity with a friend i hadnt seen any of the one and only year that firefly was on tv so i had to get the bluray i was not disappoined i have to admit that part of the reason that i bought this was because i had been watching summer glau in the terminator and thought she did such a wonderful job that i had to see what she had done in this series this was a fun yet serious adventure story and well worth the cost the picture quality is excellent unfortunately fox terminated this series as well as the terminator series when they would have done very well if they had kept them on air and done a little promotion 
i was shown the pilot episode s by a friend and went immediately to the store to buy the dvd collection for myself i found it hard to understand how this show could have been cancelled before its first season was up witty dialog rich characters and superb acting make this a gem of a show furthermore whedons decision to build the serenity interior as a continuous interconnected series of sets is genius and adds so much to the flow of the ship environment i am an avid sci fi fantasy fan but i do not mindlessly support a show just because it has a space ship and a few laser pistols this is just good writing this show could have been set in any venue and it would have still been great but then asimov once said that good science fiction has a great human story at its core the only thing wrong with this show is that it died too soon 
i missed firefly when it was a t v show i was already a joss whedon fan having really enjoyed the buffy angel saga especially the first few years sometimes its hard for me to catch tv shows in the evening though since i teach at two colleges and usually am gone several nights a week however when one of my students also a buffy fan offered to let me preview her firefly collection i jumped at the chance i was really going in cold not knowing much about the series i started watching wioth the pilot episode i recognized some faces from buffy angel and there were some new ones i kept watching about or minutes into it i was going to leave and watch something else when i was suddenly caught riveted for the rest of the week i fell headlong into the story watched it through then sat down and watched it again roping as many of my family members in to watch with me as i could joss creates this world filled with funny lovable fallable wonderful characters they lapse from english into chinese and back again at the drop of a hat they have created a family aboard a space going ship firefly class named serenity that wonderful mix of relationships is what joss excels at you care so much about them so quickly you want to see what happens next i remember what happened with star trek i can only hope that the series will live on the movie serenity was a wonderful stand alone story that ties up a lot of loose ends from the series get it you wont be disappointed 
superb series that proves that it can be done everything from acting to effects to writing to the intangible firefly rocks my absolute highest recommendation superb 
this is an amazing series i found the first episode and in some respects the movieserenity widescreen edition to the be slightly less entertaining than the rest otherwise this was a consistently great series i cant even begin to pick a favorite episode it is my favorite scifi show its one of the few scifi shows that i have fallen in love with i loved the plot and general feel to the series but what sold me were the characters you could easily fall in love with this series without being a fan of scifi about the title of this review i have heard lots of people say how great this series was but i didnt feel like watching it a scifi drama a soap opera in space really i have watched maybe a dozen star trek episodes and i think star wars is okay i liked farscape and lexxx was fun i wouldnt go out of my way to watch any of those but if it was on i would watch it i was putting firefly into the same category so i didnt feel like watching it a friend on the other side of the country kept telling me how i should watch this series and it wasnt like other scifi fantasy that i have seen in the past i didnt give in because i was busy in an effort to get me to watch the series he bought it for me imagine my surprise when this dvd shows up at my place and even more so when i find out just how right he was dont be stubborn like me and make your friends find a way to get you to watch it go watch this series 
the firefly dvd extra features include a wonderful montage of actor and crew interviews about how it felt to be involved in this project this montage is a documentary in itself about a heroic group of artists struggling with their hope and grief in the face of heartless decisions by evil television executives but the extra features also give tidbits of information which just make the show that much more enjoyable for example the camera work was intentionally jerky in places because the aim was to reproduce the cinematic values of the old tv westerns rather than the slick overproduced space shows weve seen of late joss whedons aim was to give it a western feel and it works it works because of the characters though the episodes are occasionally reminiscent of star trek juiced up with that cast iron whedon humor the cast of nine work to make this truly an ensemble production and this is not your typical roundup of characters there is the manly captain the ass kicking female warrior the xander like tongue in cheek pilot the suspiciously sophisticated missionary the handsome fugitive doctor the rough and ready ships man the wise harlot and the mesmerizingly cheerful engineer perhaps the most captivating is river a teenaged girl who exhibits symptoms of schizophrenia after her super genius brain has been experimented on by the government to what purpose remains unclear since the show was cancelled the show may not have been cancelled but the story lives on in whedons serenity a movie slated to come out in the summer of all of the original cast members have been hired for the film so this single aborted season of firefly becomes essential viewing for those intending to see the movie and i for one cant wait 
not sure what the executives at fox were thinking when they micro managed this puppy right into the ground and then canceled it im a middle of the road sci fi fan but even apart from the quot sci fi quot label this show was is extremely well written and extremely well acted something so many shows cant actually boast i didnt actually see this when it aired other than maybe minutes one night when i was channel surfing and i later moved overseas so i had no chance to see it after that what prompted me to buy it was i remembered the previews to the show and thinking it looked cool and mostly a review written about the dvd collection and how unfortunate it was that the show was canceled and here i am writing pretty much the same thing yeah even though the premise a western in the future basically and some of the plots are a little cheesy the acting and writing pulls it together and there are weaker members of the cast but as a whole supporting team they also gelled pretty well very unfortunate that the fox executives didnt see the potential rapport this show would build with the audience but so it goes theyre out to make money and if theyre conditioned by the expectations of brain dead couch potatoes then theyll try to deliver the product they think the brain dead couch potatoes want it is a business afterall if you like farscape or picard voyager era star trek youll like this with the exception of a few choice star trek episodes id say firefly is even better 
firefly was an amazing show that wasnt given a chance by fox when it was originally broadcast episodes were shown out of order if you havent seen the show you should pick it up it well worth the price its a smart show with sharp characters great sci fi effects and amazing and fun dialogue you wont regret picking up this show wlg
this has to be one of the greatest things to ever exist i love this show and watch it over and over again i never get tired of it i can not believe they only made season of this program suits are so stupid 
i was skeptical about this show at first but when i saw that joss whedon was involved i checked it out im a huge fan of the buffy and angel series so it didnt surprise me that the show worked beautifully great characters stories and special effects make this a favorite of mine for sure buy this set and then go see the movie serenity 
my son introduced me to this failed series and guided me as we watched the dvds recently this outer space western has richness chemistry surprises excellent writing and acting sexual tension humor in other words everything it takes a bit of patience to get the full back stories on all the characters thus a guide who has seen the episodes already is a big plus once you catch on however how can you not be hooked one of the nicest surprises i have discovered in recent years this set is a must for any lovers of star wars or star trek or westerns or fans of skilled acting and writing 
absolutely love this show it has humor drama and romance rolled into an action filled sci fi series basically its a western that takes place years in our future and follows a group of independent diverse that serve as the captain and crew of serenity a firefly class freighter hence the series name through some wonderfully written plots and well delivered lines even those who arent sci fi fans can enjoy this series joss whedon really created a following for this series and the accompanying feature length movie serenity as they are all wonderfully entertaining and if you love good stories and actors that enhance your entertainment experience this is a must have best value on amazon 
at the time i am writing this review over other reviewers have given this series stars it was based on this tremendous possitive feedback that i went out and bought the series myself never having seen it or the movie i now see why everyone has given this show such good reviews the creators of firfly have combined sharp writing with very good acting and an amazing story the basic premis has been done over and over sci fi western e g star wars but the fresh spin and great character development make this a great series great shows are not always about originality if a retread is told in a manner that fires the imagination it can just as powerful what bogles my mind is how fox could completely drop the ball on this unless there were major problems with the actors not getting along of which there is no evidence or unless the writers were getting bored with the idea which is unlikely given its short run this show should have been around for at least years instead fox is now bringing us such classics as skating with the stars good job guys my hope was that the sci fi channel would pick this show up but other than viewing repeats i have not yet heard of any new production planned so i will add my voice to the hurricane of great reviews and highly recommend this series and the movie 
much much better than i expected though a star rating by folks does raise your expectations a bit my background i love scifi but more so in books than in films i have especially low expectations for tv series it hurts me to see my favorite genre get mangled time after time by humanoid aliens that look like made up humans cheesy special effects and fake looking sets the worst bad plots that rely on techy pseudo babble as spoofed by galaxyquest good sf films can overcome these problems but over the long term tv series always seem to lack the budget and or good screenplays but having liked serenity the movie and read some of the reviews here i figured id give firefly the series a try firefly was an amazingly pleasant surprise the cgi special effects are very well done but mostly limited to external views of the ship they are used sparingly and there are no space battle scenes to speak of the ship itself is very believable in the same way that the nostromo alien was it looks worn lived in and patched together in short it looks like a typical big piece of machinery not an oversized plastic toy firefly is concerned with the relationship of humans on poor frontier planets to a central government so it opts for a wild west theme which is long on atmosphere and realism but short on flashy gadgets the frequent use of chinese hints at some interesting political history as well beyond the unexpectedly good production quality the crew is what really makes the series each has his her own quirks and each episode gives you some more insight into what makes them tick my personal favorite being jayne as he is such a dumb moron there might be a good side to him somewhere but the series goes out of its way to always knock him off his pedestal whenever you start to like him oh and kaylee is a real hottie other reviewers have already written about the depth and subversive nature of the main plotline so there is no need to repeat those points 
firefly is created by the creator of angel joss whedon and youd think a guy who has written and created a series about a vampire with a soul could not do a sci fi series not true like angel firefly has the same sense of friends co workers who become family complicated and deep relations between characters and very witty banter between characters this series single handly made me like a science fiction series because this series not only a sci fi but it is also a western as well if youre a fan of lost prison break heroes or any of those other garbage fictional series this is not the series for you but if you want to see a television series that will make you think and leave you satisifed by the end of the evening but still make you wanting more this is the series for you its got action comedy romance horror utopian society and western gun fights this series is true joss whedon work 
i watched a few episodes when it originally aired but for some reason i didnt stay with it maybe there was something else on at the sametime but for whatever reason i am glad i rediscovered this on amazon instant video prime ive wached the whole series in order and now ive purchased the bluray since i just finished watching i will likely go right to the extras but looking forward to watching the series again 
the only negative thing i can say about this dvd set is that by the time you finish watching all of the episodes you will be hungry for more i am just mind boggled on why fox would ever cancel a show this great how could you do that fox how someone needs to bring this show back quick this series has great interesting characters a nice plot and great character development you simply must see this show and join me in giving fox a big quot boo quot 
im one of those idiots that never watched this show while it was on television i think i saw maybe half of one episode before it got cancelled man if i could have that to do over again firefly is an awesome series like all classic shows particularly sci fi it is a bit inaccessible at first as youre bombarded with images characters plots and roles that come at you from dizzying angles and without immediate resolution however that chaos eventually becomes fireflys great strength which sadly is only evident over the long term firefly is what i wish the new star wars movies had been long on character development full of style and never quite what it seems just when you think you have each character from the taciturn but loveable captain to the beautiful companion to the surly thug figured out they do something to throw a wrench in it and make you start over nearly from scratch i know now that i largely missed out not really on the episodes as i have the dvds but on the chance of doing my small part to keep it from getting cancelled however thanks to the glory of the internet and of dvd sales were soon to get a firefly movie serenity and perhaps just perhaps with some luck and a network executive with a spine a reprise of the show firefly deserves so much better than how it was treated and the legions of loyal fans cultish tendency to refer to one another as browncoats aside are a testament to that if you get your hands on these dvds youll know exactly what im talking about 
i love this series i was really upset when i found out it had been cancelled ive never felt this way about any show before dont really care much for westerns either to the person who said they thought it was joss just doing alien resurection his way no he didnt care for the film but no this was something that had been in his head before he had anything to do with that not shocked about foxs nixing this show either they have very bad ways of doing things dont know if the fox execs read this or not dont much care i just hope that some other network picks this up like the wb and brings serenity back on the air for us p l e a s e p s why is the quot gag reel quot edited the one i downloaded a while back was much longer egg 
the tragedy of fireflys pilot being cut from an exciting two hour premiere to a different one hour episode has already been widely lamented yet even with the early abridgement i cannot fathom how this show could not have performed better it is full of not only quirkly fun ideas but extremely well written with an interesting premise one cannot say this is the type of show anyone quot expected quot but it should come as no surprise that creator joss wheldon gave birth to another series full of solid scripts quotable quotes and unforgettable characters the actors do a tremendous job with potraying the chemistry and sometimes lack thereof of a small group of adventurers but they have certainly been set up for success by wheldon there will be those who snort and say you cant really find any sort of depth in a space western but those same people probably are shocked to find credible philosophical works being written on buffy the vampire slayer im sure most of us fans who have sniffed out this boxed set can agree fox dumped this one far too soon our collective solace with a firefly movie in the works and such series as family guy resuscitated due to strong dvd sales can a firefly revival be far behind 
this is an amazing trilogy it has been around for awhile but it is truly a classic that i can watch over and over get all three then get started on the current hobbit series 
loved it gotta see the one next year excitement abound in this wonderful adventure that is full of beautiful scenery and scarily lifelike special effects the weirdest thing i thought was how they got the hobbits to look short that was cool when you get into the theater you become like a wide eyed child its so amazing that some of it is really hard to believe its a little on the dark side and being hours slightly tedious until the end but wow its great go and see this in the largest theater you can possibly go to within fair driving range this is not to be wasted on vcrs or dvds watch it now while its still on the big screen larger and louder than life 
transferring a book to the screen is always a dangerous proposition simply put too much can go wrong the two mediums are simply too different for most adaptations to hold up with any integrity transferring what many consider the best book of the twentieth century to screen well logically that should simply be an act of folly tolkien wrote a deeply drawn story with passion and vision and these are things that transfer poorly to the silver screen as roger ebert noted the trilogy is mostly about leaving places going places being places and going on to other places all amid fearful portents and speculations the books are also about the use and abuse of power the ability of one soul to make a difference and the growth a person will and must undergo once they leave their home all in all too much for a film of any commercial value or length to reasonably tackle so obviously something had to go largely what was changed was mood and tone while the books felt airy and gently paced as it moved its hobbit heroes through the bumps and hollows of middle earth introducing them to a wide breadth of that worlds inhabitants the film takes the central motivation the threat of the one ring and ties its fate to that frame alone as a result the core of the tale does shift from frodo to the fellowship as a whole and the tone does move drastically and becomes much darker contrary to much spilled ink however this is not inconsistent with the book middle earth has never been portrayed as a world in its prime the elves are leaving dying out the dwarves are merely a shadow of their former selves mankind is without leadership and the isolationist hobbits have cut themselves off possibly fatally from the happenings of the world around them into this stagnancy returns the corrupting power and strength of the one ring this is dark stuff tom bombadil and musical trappings cannot hide this what remains is a darker leaner narrative but one that retains many of the key elements that make this story so worth telling in any form never has the corrupting nature of power and the temptation it poses to all who possess it been so passionately and elegantly told frodos internal struggles gandalfs fight for knowledge and understanding the conflict of the elves to leave and save the civilization that they have grown beyond but also formed the tragedy and sorrow of the loss of a dwarfs entire culture and need to use the enemys strongest weapon against him and knowing that such a thing must not be done these are all wonderfully rich stories and themes that any single movie would take pride in dealing singly with fellowship tackles all of these vital threads and to varying degrees of success weaves them into a magical quilt that most intelligent observers said was impossible and could never be done there is magic in this movie and it comes from its smallest moments a gleam in gandalfs eyes a held back tear in frodos eyes the moment of understanding in boromirs stance the addiction of bilbo and the envy of galadriel as she confronts frodo this is all the stuff of legend and of magic and as magic makers nobody on this production has ever been better than they are here peter jackson howard shore andrew lesnie ian mckellen all are hitting on all cylinders this is as close as film can get to fulfilling its potential as a medium while celebrating the achievements of another wholly different one 
that may seem like an overblown thing to say about a swords and sorcery sort of movie but lotr fotr more than bringing the books to beautiful life stands out for its heartfelt acting and presentation and its daring choices in displaying that emotion in a culture where irony and sarcasm generally triumph over anything resembling sincerity fotr triumphs in its unabashed love for its characters and their quest from meditative shots of the faces of the fellowship and the films many moments of humour to its grand landscapes and epic music this movie demands that you become swept up in it beginning with a powerful and eerie voice over sequence to provide you with the background of the trilogys events you dont need to have read the books to enjoy this you are immediately made aware of the power of the one ring that causes so much trouble for our heros the film does an excellent job of portraying the willful nature of the ring through a number of small details including a very eerie scene when bilbo drops the ring and it doesnt bounce but stops dead on the floor before him as the fellowship comes together not quite enough time is spent on learning each of its members but if youre attentive to detail throughout the film facial expresions and interactions to the side of the main action in a scene does fill in a lot the battle scenes which are many are very well done although very blurry and hard to focus on this is effective in conveying the fact that violence happens very quickly and that survival is as much as matter of wits as force while there isnt a single weak performance in this special note should be made of the incredible work ian mckellan brings to this film as gandalf the actors playing aragorn boromir frodo and legolas are also particularly good two scenes in the film are particularly striking because they show men heroic men grieving the beauty honesty and unfamiliarity although less so after in these scenes is striking and each time i saw the film times now i was floored by how utterly still the theater became in those moments gandalf as a wonderful speech in the film in which he says in response to frodo wishing none of this had ever happened quot all men who live in such times wish that were so but all we can do is make the most of the time we are given quot it seems this year we have gotten the art we deserve 
in the devided land of middle earth a new force breaths life a ring of pure power is uncovered a journey of epic grandeur is begun you all know and love lord of the rings and how exciting to know in your lifetime we get them brought to life filmed within the gorgeous land of new zealand no less fellowship of the rings kicks off the trilogy and sets a new standard for all fantasy films that come in the future sharing that position with mr potter in my little book of course peter jackson is at this very moment while you read creating the next installments how can a tolkien fan complain ah technology there are battles that are some of the best ever created frenzied and crazy sword slashing arrow wisping fun will keep you on the edge the dvd is gorgeous the picture is vivid and the sound is exceptional i read one review claiming that he had some trouble i wish i knew the answer to his problem because for me with a dolby digital dts decoder it sounds fantastic imagine what the special extended dvd will sound like in november with dts wow as you can tell seeing lord of the rings is an exciting experience and until november this dvd will do very nicely s a o s 
this movie was a thrill to see and i was so releaved when the scenery and story from the original novel were followed on screen the actors did a magnificant job of portraying the true characteristic from the novel but the greatest thing about the movie was not the acting the special effects or scenery but in my opinion was the directing the directer peter jackson is obviously a big fan of j r r tolkien which is shown through the fast amount of knowledge injected into the film from the original story in the great and masterful novels watch this movie its a joy to see your imagination come to the big screen 
peter jackson took a great risk making the lord of the rings trilogy there is such a cult following to tolkiens original work that it is a great risk for any filmmaker to make especially after the dungeons dragons flop made shortly before this film the risk was so great that i didnt even go see it in the theater especially when i heard that elijah wood and liv tyler had major roles in it but i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised not only is this a good movie but it is one of the best movies ive seen in the fantasy adventure genre jackson is loyal to tolkiens vision i do admit it has been a while since ive read tolkien but i think i remember correctly and the production design and costumes are phenomenal the attention to detail is amazing elijah wood sean astin billy boyd and dominic monaghan are hobbits personified as is peter jackson elijah wood hasnt done that great of a job in the past but i cant think of anyone who could be a better frodo viggo mortensen plays his role physical and dark but still heroic wonderful job and sir ian mckellan well i dont think i have to go into how great of an actor he is these performances were excellent the art direction is superb they brought in two major illustrators of tolkiens books as consultants and of course the story comes from one of the greatest you dont even notice that almost three hours has passed most of the featurettes cover some piece of information contained in another featurette but they still add to the experience of the movie the houghton mifflin featurette covers a lot of what went into publishing tolkiens books the sci fi channel special is the definite best of the three featurettes then there are the lordoftherings net featurettes which are minute featurettes which cover everything from the actors to the music to the locations they compliment the other featurettes very well giving even more inside information on the film there are also previews of the fellowship of the rings special edition dvd the two towers film and the two towers video game its a great movie but i dont know if id buy this edition there is a special edition coming out soon that has around minutes of additional footage and many more extras including commentaries i think i personally will wait until all three movies have been released and in their special edition packaging because who knows what kind of great box set packing extras and so forth will be there once the trilogy is completed 
but it is amazing th ewhole trilogy is very well crafted by peter jackson the fellowship of the ring kicks off the trilogy this movie introduces people rather than doing anyting else i mean dont get me wrong this movie is still good but people got bored due to too much talking but still i really liked this movie plus with the extended edition you will find out more stuff about the movie with the extra minutes this is a really good film and you should buy it 
lets start with the fact that the extended version is a big improvement on what other dvds try to do with deleted extended scenes instead of having them as an extra feature that is shown separately from the actual film seeing these scenes in context as a part of the whole movie makes them and the movie richer and their nuances much clearer i cant even complain that the production company hadnt advertised in advance that the extended version would be out a few months after the theatrical one because they had except for the commentaries which ill get to in a moment the extra features are just perfect and should be an example and an insparation to other films instead of the usual behind the scenes quot blah blahs quot or quot featuretes quot and theatrical trailers we get a full account of how the movie was created from the adaption of the book to a script to finding the actors the work on the film itself or rather the films and so on this is done so thoroughly that no matter what interests you in the process of making this film you will easily find it on this dvd set because of the well organized menus as for the commentaries the casts and peter jackson and co s were the most interesting the only thing i didnt like was the fact that the cast hadnt been given the chance to do it as a group except for the hobbits who commented together and their group dynamics amp discussions were fun and interesting viggo mortensens commentary about aragorn was also sorely missed 
perfect that sums up the dvd set there is no other way to describe it instead of doing a film anaylisis which i could considering im a film student i wont instead im just reviewing the dvd set itself because im assuming those who are reading this have already seen this movie if you havent seen this movie then my recomendation is this rent it if you love this movie buy this dvd set if you found it medicore and a bit too long then id recomend the original theatrical version this dvd set is amazig it has literally days worth of bonuses you will not be disapointed with this set i guarantee it i could go on and on about the bonuses but what it all comes down to is that it has every single dvd extra you would need if there is a bonus that didnt make it onto this dvd set then it wasnt worth it in the first place as for the extended movie the extra minutes only make a great movie greater though it is only minutes quot only minutes quot you ask believe me i wish this flick was hours long it does a lot for this film because it does little things that add up such character development and more depth to the world of middle earth overall this is a flawless dvd set in my opinion it is the best dvd to be produced to date lord of the rings isnt my favorite movie but after being engulfed by this dvd i cant help but think otherwise the fellowship of the rings extended edition is more than just a dvd its an experince 
a marvelous first edition to the lord of the rings trilogy this movie captures the beauty scope and humanity even in hobbits and elves and dwarves decribed by tolkien in his tales i was especially impressed with the characterizations of merry and pippin and sam and frodo what marvelous hobbits they are the technical wizardry is thrilling the landscapes are breathtaking and the acting is top notch not s single character was left quot hollow quot or quot flat quot even gollum in his abbreviated appearance was given three dimensions its a wonderful film seeing it so many times too you pick up on little things like legolas walking on top of the snow while everyone else is chest deep in it that image alone spoke volumes about the handsome elves cat like abilities without saying a word its marvelous you must see it 
im not gonna lie i didnt really know about lotr before this movie then i heard it was based on a book and was hooked this movie was excellent and an amazing adaptation of a great book my favorite part is the battle with the cave troll and the orcs in the mines of moria
if you only want to buy one lord of the rings fellowship dvd you might want to get the extended dvd edition to be released in november that dvd will have an extra half an hour of new footage inserted into the film and lots of original supplementary features but me im a sap i want both versions of the film i saw this film in theatres more than twice as much as ive seen any film since my pre teen years why well aside from the possibility that i have the geek gene lotr fotr is the best fantasy movie ever made theres action great visuals but most importantly and this is something thats sadly lacking in modern star wars films heart the title of the film is quot fellowship quot and thats also the theme a bond of fellowship or friendship which allows for some very intimate and heart wrenching moments sam and frodos friendship merry and pippin gandalf and everyone superb chemistry brought forth by great writing and dead on casting for the unfeeling among you theres a few beheadings g and visually this film is stunning wonderfully detailed and intelligent designs that require multiple viewings pauses zooms to appreciate it all the dvd transfer is superb making the visuals even better in particular i think the balrog looks at lot better on the dvd than he did on the screen theres some very sharp colours on this dvd as for special features this august version has mostly recycled tv and internet specials but theres also a ten minute preview of the two towers the next lotr film and a preview of the extended dvd the previews have me eagerly awaiting the next releases in this franchise i highly recommend this movie and for the record ive read the books but i actually think the film adaptation improves on some things the characters are more developed 
i cant say enough good things about this movie firstly if you are considering which version of this movie to purchase i would recommend that you get the extended version i know that peter jackson has to keep the theatrical release under hours for the sake of the box office but the additional material here is fantastic it is seemlessly added to the film and upon watching it you will feel like it was a more complete story than the original version that being said i dont think that ive seen a more impressive use of the cinematic form in many years this is a story that utilizes everthing that makes the movies magical from the sheer size of the story to the makeup to the special effects to the cinematography it practically single handedly restored my faith in the ability of hollywood to produce a quality product that is not only entertaining but visionary i think that it was great disservice to peter jackson that he was not given the best director oscar last year im sure that he will be denied that honor again this year but i can truthfully say that i believe that his achievment with these first two movies is on par with what coppola achieved with the first two godfather movies obviously they are very different movies but the mastery of the cinematic form is very obvious in both the storytelling is magnificent and i am sure that when the trilogy is done it will be remembered as one of the greatest achievements in film history if you have ever read the books then you know what a thankless task this was there seemed to be no human way to convey what was on the written page peter jackson has not only given us toklkiens vision but has turned it into pure magic on film i hope that he eventually wins the academy award for the third film in this triology because it would be a shame for this kind of achievement to go unrewarded go out and buy it you wont be dissapointed if you have a widescreen tv and a good surround sound system you will be treated to one of the best presentations that you have ever seen or heard its a real demo disc to show off any system this really is as good as movie making gets 
i love this movie and really enjoy being able to watch tlotr the quality of video is amazing try it youll like it 
its difficult to review these films without lots of superlatives if you are either a film lover aspiring pro or a student interested in what makes a film tick these dvds are priceless many dvd sets have a director and perhaps a few pivotal cast members talking about their work on a film this dvd takes the time to question the production designers and other below the line crew to ask them how they put lotr together the documentaries here are excellent a brief biography of tolkien himself all sorts of goodies on the making of this production storyboards and crude computer animation for scenes showing how the special effects were designed in certain scenes you can even watch the crude animation and the finished scenes side by side i particularly enjoyed learning about the tolkien illustrators especially alan lee whose work influenced jackson and were then coaxed into leading the production design teams costume designers and illustrators will no doubt love the diverse galleries and pictures that are also available on the dvd you do get a sense of what an adventure the film was for the actors especially the four younger men playing frodo legolas merry and pippin who are all at the beginning of their careers literally so for bloom their exuberance is balanced by more seasoned actors like mortensen and mckellan elijah wood rolls his eyes describing how sean astin overprotected him just as samwise gamgee would particularly on a helicopter shoot i found this unintentionally funny in a dark sort of way tangent alert both astin and wood grew up in front of the cameras but astin is years older more likely to know of the twilight zone the movie helicopter accident which killed actor vic morrow father to jennifer jason leigh weirdly bloom would win a role in black hawk down around the time of lotr playing todd blackburn the young army ranger whose fall from a helicopter figured heavily in the battle of mogadishu i guess elijah didnt read that script interestingly sean astin whose parents are john astin and patty duke used to study with stella adler who promoted the stansilaski method of acting usually known as the method i e the actor becomes his or her role and nic cage has an excuse to eat cockroaches yes just read about his role in vampires kiss by the final reel of king he comes off as one of the strongest players even outshining wood sean keep up with the air traffic control especially if it helps your performance as far as the acting is concerned fellowship is so full of moments and terrific scenes that it really does seem to get better upon multiple viewings a standout example is that of sean bean as boromir its easy to dismiss boromir as a weak would be judas particularly if youve seen ronin or goldeneye rather than his excellent british tv work as sharpe but after the initial shock of his choice fades on second and third viewings bean is touching a troubled yet courageous knight who finally redeems himself boromir is even easier to sympathize with if you view the extended two towers dvd which sheds insight into his father the steward of gondor and the dark expectations heaped upon boromir his first son and heir it also helps bridge the relationship between boromir and faromir all the lotr films but especially the fellowship of the ring seem more like historical drama than fantasy the last piece to attempt this the mists of avalon miniseries does not come close in terms of depth and believability despite being based on truthful historical trends i e the passing of pagan europe to christianity and the ensuing turmoil the scenery is also breathtaking jacksons aerial shots of the snowcapped mountains of moria where one of the fellowship sacrifices himself for his friends are absolutely stunning strangely a pro review snippily suggested german mountain films as a major influence on the cinematography and film if youre a non film geek a suggestion that something is reminiscent of a german mountain film is usually a back handed swipe since those stories are often lumped together with nazi cinema leni riefenstahl initially distinguished herself as a mountain film actress and later directed the blue light before triumph of the will these films had their heyday during germanys withering weimar regime and anticipated a lot of the same themes purity of man and environment social darwinism that were later developed in nazi propaganda ergo peter jackson films a beautiful snowy vista and its automatically a homage to these films and thus suggestive of nazism this is downright insulting when you consider that this entire saga is about a fellowship of different races uniting and saving middle earth moreover the love for nature is inherent to tolkiens original text jackson has built on top of detailed thoughtful words creating a gorgeous treacherous seemingly real world george lucass recent films have been just as beautiful visually stunning really and yet they seem much more fantastical unreal than what we see in the filmed lotr moreover not only do jackson and company seem more passionate about the world theyve created in these films their characters are more passionate fully breathing fully realized as well and i say this despite being very excited about the third star wars prequel after the popularity dies down a bit expect some academics especially those with a marxist bent to find lots of faults with the film especially considering its large budget again with the german mountain film suggestion some academic critics seem to believe the last good fiction film was battleship potemkin dont let these people ruin your enjoyment of intelligent beautiful films if fellowship has an achilles heel its that it must serve as exposition and explanation for the second two films as well as parts of the hobbit despite that it manages to be a feast for the eyes ears and brain 
the first movie tells of the finding of the quot one ring quot evil begins to return to the land of middleearth as the dark lord begins to search for his ring this ring will allow him to cover the world in a second darkness a fellowship forms to keep the ring from his possesion and try to end his eveil reign forever an excellent dvd with almost an hour of very good deleted scenes it is rare to find a dvd with deleted scenes that are actually good these deleted scenes have been put into the mocie itself so you dont have to watch them seperately finally an idea that makes sense 
undoubtedly this film will become a classic in cinema history it has as much rich detail and well scripted characters as the original books the special effects are unique they present additional scales of the settings and grandure to the action scenes the fight scenes utilizes a jumpy handheld camera that can be dizzying to look at i mostly speak of balins tomb but are still well orchestrated and gripping the cinematography is unique and plentiful slow motion shots wild camera angles and extreme close ups are very abundant and add a visually hypnotic level to the film its style also embellishes the story telling one just has to look at the screen to feel the emotions of the characters tell what their relationships are and tell what is going on the characters in particular shine in this film it is actually the very thing that ive enjoyed most about this the characters are easy to understand and are very well developed their depth and complexities are strongly evident their relationships are close and heartwarming and they actually make you care for them the films steady pace inventive style and expert storytelling is entrancing for the whole three hours the extra thirty minutes on this disc set add to the characters developments especially to aaragorn whose heritance to gondor is explained in greater detail and foreshadow the events of the future lord of the rings episodes namely the scene where the elves are seen traveling to the gray havens later referred to in return of the king four discs for this movie is an esteemed blessing it is a treasure in my collection and i cant wait until the next two films are released in this way 
okay if you are a first time buyer if you are buying lotr dvds so that you can have behind the scenes material in addition to the movie i recommend the extended versions each of which are four discs with those you get around hours of documentaries for each movie with these limited editions you get around hours for all three put together however the bigger issue is sort of the movies themselves i would suggest renting the theatrical versions watching them and then renting the extended versions borrowing them from a friend and watching them then if you prefer the extended version of the movies and dont care about ever watching the theatrical versions again then definitely buy the extended version dvds theyre totally worth your money if youre just covering your ears and saying dont tell me all the technical little details about each different dvd version gaaaack all i want is to buy lord of the rings on dvd whatever then i would say buy these limited editions 
note this review will be best appreciated if youve watched the films during the decembers of and three films were released they are the fellowship of the ring the two towers and the return of the king they are some of the greatest films ever made and in my opinion the best films of this century it is now years since the first film was released since the second and since the third here ill show the ages of stellar cast and crew who made this film come to life at the time of the st films release elijah wood the american actor who portrayed frodo baggins was then is nowviggo mortensen the danish american actor who portrayed aragorn then is nowian mckellen the english actor who portrayed gandalf then is nowsean astin the american actor who portrayed samwise gamgee then is nowdominic monaghan the english actor who portrayed meriadoc brandybuck then is nowbilly boyd the scottish actor who portrayed peregrin took then is nowsean bean the english actor who portrayed boromir then is nowjohn

galadriel then is nowchristopher lee the english actor who portrayed saruman then is nowkarl urban the new zealand actor who portrayed eomer then is nowand finally peter jackson the new zealand director then is now how does this make you feel next a look into a world that might have been in the early stages of development peter jackson faced a huge decision casting the dozens of characters that make up the lord of the rings what he came up with was one of the finest casts ever assembled for a motion picture if not the finest but before the actors seen on screen were cast there was the lord of the rings cast that never came to be here ill reveal this cast based on early casting decisions and give my own opinion on who should have actually been cast frodo baggins was played by elijah wood who was picked from a group of people who auditioned for the part could have been jake gylenhaal dominic monaghan gilbert godfried what happened gylenhaal auditioned for the role but elijah wood received the part monaghan played merry and thankfully we were spared from gilbert godfried aragorn was played by viggo mortensen whose son lobbied for him to get the role could have been russell crowe stuart townsend daniel day lewis nicolas cage vin diesel what happened russell crowe declined the role due to scheduling conflicts gladiator stuart townsend was refused too young daniel day lewis refused the role and cage turned down the role as well family obligations vin diesel was turned down and with hours to spare mortensen was cast i can only say thank goodness to cage and diesel being turned down i cannot imagine nic cage saying lets hunt some orc or the bald diesel doing anything to help the film russell crowe and daniel day lewis would have perfect in the role of aragorn crowe would have brought his charisma and rugged looks to the part while day lewis would have brought his on screen intensity and acting skills i can only imagine how great the movie would have been dont get me wrong viggo was electrifying in the part of aragorn gandalf was played by ian mckellen who was a surprise choice could have been sir sean connery sir christopher lee sir patrick stewart sam neill what happened connery turned the role down because he couldnt understand the plot patrick stewart didnt like the script and turned it down christopher lee was too old but took the role of saruman sam neill didnt get the role a lot of interesting casting choices here connery would have been interesting you shall not pash he certainly looks the part not understanding the plot thats quite a feeble excuse i expect he turned it down because he couldnt say greyhame gandalf greyhame patrick stewart should have voiced gandalf like james earl jones with darth vader christopher lee one of the greatest actors ever was too old but also typecast as a villain sam neill looks the part but was probably too young and not as famous as the other choices boromir was played by sean bean could have been liam neeson bruce willis val kilmer what happened liam neeson passed bruce willis and val kilmer were passed sean beans boromir and bernard hills th eacute oden are my two favorite characters in the trilogy so i dont know if anyone could have been better in the role than bean bruce willis could not have played boromir period liam neeson now theres a badass boromir i dont know who would have been better bean or neeson i can only imagine galadriel was played by cate blanchett could have been tilda swinton what happened swinton turned it down thankfully arwen was played by liv tyler could have been helena bonham carter britney spears what happened bonham carter was turned down plus the role of an elven princess doesnt match with her image britney spears peter jackson im willing to forgive you this one plus other choices that were thankfully turned down sylvester stallone as gimli russell crowe as sam michael keaton and david bowie as elrond and christopher walken as aragorn i want to know who is responsible for even mentioning the name of christopher walken 
the first one of the lord of the rings trilogy the extended edition is a lot better than the theatrical one best movie ever made 
 nd december saturday h pm i was at one of the greatest lisbon cinemas so jorge to watch the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring i have had read the books years before and loved them i bought everything that tolkien wrote and when i heard that they are going to pass the books to the silver screen i get too excited more than usual for a movie in that far far year i read all the newspapers who talked about the movie and i read also about the minutes of the lotr trilogy showned in cannes and the success they caused more and more i was excited to see but i could not imagine that after minutes of watching the magnific lotr logo and the prologue with cate blanchett as the narrator i was in for something special i knew in the first minutes that it was going to be a spectacular movie in all the way everything is in its right place the actors the score the landscapes scenery visual effects i believe middle earth is real after watching the movie i really belive in the characters in the places me and my friends run after the movie to buy the original soundtrack by howard shore if you can buy all of them especially the leatherette editions wich now become a treasure to keep and very hard to find i didnt know nothing about peter jackson the director producer actor musician who also wrote the adapted screenplay with her wife fran walsh and philippa boyens but who reveals a great talent to tell the magnificent tolkien story and a passion too great of the story and of j r r tolkien thanks to him again the movies are different from the books are different things the special extended dvd edition is much better because adds character development and more scenes and music as well great ones aragorn in the tomb of his mother at rivendell conversation between aragorn and boromir legolas throwing lots of more arrows the voice of sauron at the councill of elrond scene and so on i enjoy also the appendices part i and ii explaining all that we want to know about the cast and crew and the big designer team with alan lee and john howe the weta workshop and the visual effects the training of the actors the son of viggo tell his father to accept the role of aragorn also an introduction at tolkiens world and life adapting a screenplay bigger than anything the problems in cutting scenes i understand why they had to cut some scenes and give more depth to arwen and not showing glorfindel arwens brother and frodos saviour as in the book i accept all of their decisions and im glad they do so the last but not the least the package with the beautifull drawings by alan lee makes the edition much better also everything is good fitted the story so well thats why i have no words that fully describe my feelings about this movie this movie is my all time favorite this movie is art and surely its magic 
this movie exceeded all of my expectations thats saying a lot considering that they were very high i hoped the movie wouldnt ruing the book like most movies do i hoped it would bring the magical world to life i hoped it would retain the serious and dark tone etc etc i got all that and more the acting was wonderful the special effects were flawless the movie was still dark and serious but dont worry the hobbits still had cute furry feet it followed the book very faithfully and the very best part was just how well it brought that world to life the sets were unbelievable i wished places like that truly existed the hobbits were tiny the elves were lithe graceful elvish the characters true not only to the book but true to life this movie was everything it could have been and more just like ai could have been so much but didnt quite make it all the way just like the first batman movies were good and dark before they deteriorated all right enough from me i think i ve gien you more than enough reason to at least rent it before buying 
i loved this movie so much ive never read the books im more into american literature than british but contrary to some opinions i was able to appreciate the film anyway good vs evil mythical creatures swordfights whats not to love i also enjoyed the documentaries on the dvd they can be a little repetitive if one watches them sequentially but they are very informative and the shots of new zealand are breathtaking 
i was excited when i heard about this and a little skeptical too there have been a few animated film versions of the books that just did not do it justice however you cannot compare animation films like that to a full scale movie epic like this it is true that the action was emphasized in the film over the poetic pathos of the book but to spectacular effect the movie was gripping and visually stunning the influence of the famous artwork by the brothers hildebrant was prevelent throughout this is artwork that i remember seeing and being influenced by as a teenager there were some subplots that were not approached but im sure it was done so as not to confuse or interupt the natural flow of the movies story i was very impressed it made me want to read the books again i look forward to the next instalment and i anxiously await the dvd 
this is an excellent movie and the only thing that i object is the violence but thats important for the story to work anyways i would not reccomend taking young children under merely because theres some violence and its really not appropriate for young children to see not only that but itll probably frighten and scare most children that are under the plot costumes special effects are excellent its obvious that its well made and well acted its definately worth seeing and worth spending money for 
i have seen all three of the extended dvd editions of lord of the rings andi cant help but ask the following questions how could a film team in new zeeland without prior experience of advancedfilm making be able to create the mastodont lord of the rings film trilogy how could peter jackson who previously had done low budget splatter filmslike bad taste and braindead pull this off i am baffled how could this massive amount of visual material be created and put togetherin such a comparably short time how could it all be coordinated andharmonized into such a consistent whole how could the genuine feeling ofculture and history of a whole world be created in that short time itdoesnt add up its not natural and it doesnt matter that the film crewin the extra documentary material on the dvds tell us how dedicated and hardthey worked it still doesnt add up i am telling you it aint natural there must have been some paranormal or magical forces involved in themaking or perhaps tolkiens spirit coordinated the work how could they find so many actors that fit so perfectly into the roles andacted as if they actually were their role characters and not hired actors and all integrated with the visual environments and special effects work incomprehensible supermundane forces must have played a part i can see some minor weak points in the films but on the whole they standas a world on its own above the reach of criticism as with the books myfavorite is the fellowship of the ring the two towers feels a little liketransportation i thought the weakest part here was the ent he feltunconvincing and childish with his too obvious human characteristics andexpressions like an illustration from a childrens book and some ofthe orcs look a little too caricaturish with their long noses when reading the books i imagine characters and environments a littledifferently more mundane down to earth with ordinary persons put inextraordinary situations so that there becomes a strong contrast forexample the shire countryside being mellow in tone to contrast more withthe magic glimmering of the elven world in the film all the maincharacters glow with charisma and everything is really intense from colorsto acting but that is alright it is still very well done and there is nodefinite way because everyone who reads the books has his or her personalvision the return of the king has grown upon me and it is just as great as thefirst film but in a different way it has grand beauty within the contextof war oooh and that green dress arwen is wearing at the wedding a colorfrom beyond this world the extended editions have many great scenes added especially in the returnof the king who can forget the episode with gandalf and pipin atop minastirith by the white tree talking of days gone past or the mouth ofsauron the extra material is very generous sometimes a little too generous because every magic trick is revealed but if you are yourself an artist or work with film it is indispensible information and very enjoyable towatch those involved in the films also tell us how difficult it was to break upwhen it was all over i can imagine the making of these films was a burnoutfor some difficult to top off to them i can say that the cosmos islimitless and there is always some new beauty around the corner 
i would like to start with a quote by c s lewis quot here are beauties that will pierce like a sword or burn like cold iron here is a story that will break your heart quot i saw this movie on opening day and i have not been able to write about it until now because i was so shocked this film picked me up in the first few minutes and carried me along with it i experienced everything the characters went through my whole system went on overload before i start nitpicking however i would like to state two facts if you go expecting to see the movie be just like the book youre going to hate it a movie cannot be a book and a book cannot be a movie it is perfectly impossible unless you can make an apple an orange and vice versa this is only act of a three act drama good that said we can continue this is a wonderful movie period since a film consists of three elements background characters and effects i shall cover all including complaints i have seen the first is background and ill put the script into this topic new zealnd is middle earth i was simply awed by the closesness of the two the shire is beautiful it has that lush green homey sense tolkien has in his books rivendell was also neat it demonstrated nicely the collision of two cultures elven and man for elrond was both it is mostly elvish for example everthing is outdoors however there are very human elements as well like warm beds and rich indoor decorations moria is suitably grand yet morbid lorien is beautiful with lots of trees and i liked the way there were so many lamps lit everywhere at night isengard is cold and impersonal and the mining is one of the best parts of the film i dont see why everyone says this movie has a bad script it is not tolkien but tolkiens dialogue works much better to the page than the reel however statements are taken right from the book like quot shortcut to mushrooms quot quot if by my life and death i can protect you i will quot quot fool of a took quot etc some of it is missing true i would have liked to hear the part about looking fair and feeling foul but all in all it works next and most importantly are the characters dont forget that there are many many characters in this story and not all will be fleshed out in the first act frodo is done admirably well by elijah wood the scene after the balrog brings tears to my eyes as when he is trying to slip away from the fellowship sam is of the same caliber he is not dog like yet the message is clear he will do anything even suffer through a journey worse than death for frodo merry and pippen are simply hilarious i admired the script a lot for this for in such a dark movie humor is almost impossible however it is done and done gracefully and successfully trust me these two will steal your heart aragorn is a tough and silent ranger and i know well see his character grow throughout the story i was dissapointed with legolas and gimlis lack of time but i think that aragorn and boromir needed center stage for obvious reasons i would bet money that the elf and dwarf will be main characters in the next film for all of you fans legolas does walk on snow it is a sight to see i have heard people say that boromir was freaky i disagree for me he was one of the most well developed characters in the first film he is a brave and courageous soldier who is tempted through his good intentions we see his kindness when he teaches the little hobbits to fight but we see his pride when he tries to seize the ring from frodo in the end in one of the best scenes he redeems himself he fights like a man possessed to save his friends and his soul and in one of the most heart rending scenes in the film the fighting uruk hai finally get the better of him its not easy trust me gandalf too was amazing among the hobbits he is a nice grandfatherly old man but watch out he will show his ferocity when faced with saruman or a balrog saruman is also very neat a very hateful villain who goes power hungry some people say that elrond is too mean but i found him only stern and a little fierce elrond was these for he was not in an easy position throughout the whole book galadriel was interesting to say the least i am not sure if i liked her interpretation all in all but i think that the mirror scene where she morphs into that thing is a perfectly valid interpretation for all of you who are complaining it might not be yours but the book does say that she grows terrible in the books i rather liked that aspect even though i am not quite sure if i agree it was that drastic arwens role is small so dont worry about any xenarwen she is onscreen for about minutes total the orcs are disgusting the hobbits are beautifully simple and the black riders are terrifying lastly there are effects i will be the first to tell you i am no computer guru but as the average elf on the street i can honestly say that i didnt think quot oh effects quot when i saw them indeed i didnt even notice big relief after star wars e i i can assure you the cave troll was an ugly troll and the balrog is awesome even if it does not agree with your own personal interpreation the size differences are seamless not once did i get jarred back to reality frodo really looked gollum though we only see his face outline or hands looks like a flesh and blood creep if i didnt know through common sense that one cannot do a balrog any other way i would not have known that cgi exists in this story also i liked the zoomy cameras battles are hectic and confused things and that technique helped to further the feeling that you are there i suppose we could have seen the conventional overhead shots but is that what say aragorn saw as he was fighting for his life concerning gandalf and sarumans duel i think it is a valid interpretation we dont know all that happened and im sure that the two wizards didnt simply talk over coffee the scene doesnt last very long anyways i found it a good way to show how powerful saruman was he overpowered gandalf pretty quick keep in mind that in the two towers the tables will turn and i think the contrast will help understanding i know this film moved faster than the books there is a reason for that i think the book was with the exceptions of the shire rivendell and lorien a continuous battle or chase the events in the film were tightened up to ooze that very feeling my only complaint is lorien is hardly a place of rest oh well i know that parts did have to be sped up even though more time there would have been nice yes this movie has its faults they are very small ones thank goodness however i dont think i can single any out until i see at least quot the two towers quot because until then i cannot say for sure what was lacking one cannot honestly critique les miserables for example after only the first act the story has just begun my only big complaint is that i have to wait a whole year to see the next film 
the first installment of quot the lord of the rings quot is quite simply an incredible accomplishment considering how difficult it would be to satisty people new to the story as well as people who have read the books multiple times peter jackson should be given the keys to the kingdom i wont get into the plot if youve read the books you know it if you havent see the movie i will say that the film succeeds on every level i can think of you feel like you are really watching real people and other creatures in a real place the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous the costumes acting settings props weapons language everything is in place having said that will quot the fellowship of the ring quot be all things to all people no i imagine some will think that too much has been left out and that too much attention has been placed on action if youve read the books i think you will agree that jackson has kept the action moving much more than in the book what jackson has left out as far as details of the journey and character background i think are enough to keep the film interesting without slowing it down i think people will be talking about this film for a long long time i saw several groups of people standing around talking about the film after it was over they all seemed to love it the film will probably send more people to the book which is great since this is one of the great works not just of fantasy but of th century literature the film will almost certainly be nominated for many awards and deservedly so this holiday season treat yourself to a grand adventure 
most simply put this is masterpiece a film that graphically epitomizes what an unbounded treasure an artistically derived adaptation of a simply wondrous novel split into three segments because of size can really be given the fact that tolkien was himself a genius a noted don of literature at oxford and a lifelong friend of famed novelist cs lewis it is no wonder that much of contemporary science fiction genre and the fantasy genre are all largely derivitive of his thought and work especially contemporary efforts such as the harry potter series which is not to say that none of it is any good but to point out the singular genius and imagination that this work represented when orifginally published as literature in the s given all that it was hard to be very optimistic in terms of ones expectations for the series having already suffered through an animated attempt to portray portions of the legends associated with his work long ago yet to my utter amazement this really is a very faithful and imaginative recreation of all that one finds in the books yet done in a way that in some way even exceeds the power ofthe novels thus i heartily agree with the opinion of earlier reviewers who laud this film on the basis of its being a fantasy adventure and also as an adaptation of a beloved literary classic on this basis then the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring stands alone as a worthy example of what kind of cinematic possibilities can be attained with enough vision imagination and of course money for the cost of bringing this adaptation to film was astounding yet everything associated with the film is consistent with tolkiens somber vision of a world bent on a long term devolution from magic and possibility to the crushing weight of politics and power indeed the surreal mood set in the film catches tolkiens dark vision exactly as one would envision it in ones head and to this end the set and the special effets are of enormous benefit so too the casting lends itself to the mix of whimsey and amazement that the story weaves through its chapters and the levels of dark of forces that gather round the not so merry band or fellowship signal the way the world is going at least according to tolkien of course the cast of characters are really the key to the tale and director jackson has a terrific feel for this element as he weaves the characters through the tale they of course represent the contradictions and the struggle of good with evil that we each hold within ourselves and it is this struggle set in mythical times that is the key to the success of the venture but stay tuned for much more is to come a simply astounding movie and one that should need no recommendation enjoy 
peter jackson accomplished the impossible with the creation of the film the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring it was a good adaptation and this film has the best casting i have ever seen this movie is great because of the amazing cast especially viggo mortensen as aragornliv tyler as arwenandsean astin as sameveryone notices elijah wood but the film depended on the other actors being just as good and in most cases they were better they are not getting the attention they deserve this film did have some flaws i am saying this hoping people who made he movie will read it and think about what i am saying too much time spent on frodo and not enough development on supporting players hopefully on the dvd not enough of the first book in the film especially rivendell and lorthlorin frodo being a leader when he is a hobbit who does not know the outside world gandalf and aragorn are the leaders the acting was the best part of the movie every actor could say so much with just a look the scene with arwen and aragorn the best characters in the film and book is a perfect example i loved that arwen had more screne time and one of the most beautiful romances ever aragorn and arwen was shown on the screne the direction was breattaking they got the only man for the job this adaptation is good but the fight scenes were getting too much and there needed to be more time spent on the charactersthat is the soul of the book that these characters are fighting evil and the only things that make it worth while are the people and places they love so dearly that is why tolkein took the time to show them lotr is an amazing film and i hope more people will find the book if you think the film is astounding the books are times more so lord of the rings was the best kept secret in literature and now i hope more people will experience it 
whether youre a tolkien fan or not you cannot argue that this is one of the most hyped and ambitious films of the last decade aside from the new star wars and titanic both of which were horrible in my opinion peter jacksons lord of the rings is worth every inch of the hype enough to make it worth buying both the theatrical and extended edition of the dvd something i have never done before and not likely to do again first question does the extra minutes really make a difference while the length of the extra footage varies between a few seconds to a few minutes it does add a sharper edge to the movie some more frightening bits were added as well as more background stories were added and a bit more violence is noticeable it makes the movie meatier and more satisfying in the end in retrospect the theatrical version seems incomplete after viewing this extended edition though minutes doesnt seem like a lot especially when the movie is already hours long it really makes a difference second question are all the extras good oh yes while the theatrical release had some fine extras the extended edition offers loads more spanning dvds the last discs are packed with extras while the first two have a modest amouns most notibly the commentaries i always enjoy listening to commenteries and there are feature length ones on discs and theyre very entertaining and cover all bases from the technical to the trivial to the funny and outrageous aside from that there are loads of documentaries featurettes interviews storyboards and every other imaginable detail they really went all out for this version last question is it worth buying if you already own the original theatrical version the extended edition is a totally different package and i have not seen any duplicate extras on either version i love the featurettes and previews on the theatrical version so i will definitely keep it but for the meat and potatoes the extended edition is definitely the version to own for anyone who loved the movie from the casual viewer to the die hard fan should get the extended edition this is a rare movie where the hype was well deserved and a deluxe package is definitely worth shelling out for 
this movie was absolutely awesome i am fourteen years old and i genuinely enjoyed this movie many of my friends said that it was too long and boring i didnt think so at all this is the kind of movie where you have to sit and pay attention so that you dont miss any of the subtleties of the film i read the books two years ago and i liked them i was disappointed that such characters as tom bombadil werent in the movie but i guess you cant have everything please at least rent this movie you wont be dissappointed 
having at last seen all three installments of jacksons beautiful trilogy i can say that the only problem would be picking the best of the three i have leaned toward quot fellowship quot i think because of its sheer beauty the greens of the shire the russet colors of rivendell the silvers of lothlorien the alan lee and john howe designs convey the peaceful the powerful the majestic and the endangered perhaps because this film like the book it is based on is for its first two thirds the calm before the storm of action terror and violence that will permeate the next two films it is the most able to convey total harmony in all its parts the artistic design the music and the acting are all perfectly inspired and inspiring fueled and fueling of one another so much has been said of these films that it is hard to add anything meaningful but i would like to add my opinion here because i feel these films have been a gift of a sort to all whose hearts are open to their messages 
all the characters costumes scenes and plot of this movie make it a classic that will endure through the ages 
jackson and new line cinema give tolkiens work the justice it deserves the first volume in the trilogy really gets the juices flowing and i eagerly await the next i do not consider mysel a real tolkein fanatic in fact i found the books a bit heavy particularly tolkiens penchant for describing the geneology of his fictional characters but there is no doubt that tolkien created such a believable world that i almost treat this work as an piece of historical fiction jacksons movie has a faster pace than the book while still remaining true not just to the spirt but to the letter of the books too true tolkien grognards will find flaws but i enjoyed the attention to detail that jackson lavishes this is where the dvd excells as you can go back and look for fresh stuff in each viewing my only compaint is the blatant merchandising they are releasing two versions of the dvd one with minutes of cut scenes i found this a bit much one dvd with all the extra material would have been much more logical 
in the first of the three part trilogy we meet frodo baggins elijah wood and his other hobbit friends they live in the shrine where things are happy and smooth his great uncle bilbo baggins however has a dark secret we soon found out what in the form of one ring presented to us by gandolf the elf ian mckellan soon things get darker their happy days are no more to anyone who enjoyed any of the books this is a must see director peter jackson actually improes a little on charactar development but at the same time delivers us the powers and horrors of the ring there are sveral frightening scenes such as frodo in a cave with the ring there are so many great performances in this film though i mean wow great cast truth be told theres far less action than in return and tt but we dont need action here ian mckellan really is outstanding as gandolf and christoper lee as always is great as a villian this however is a must see for anyone the ending is sharp and sudden so anyone who hasnt read the books dont be scared off by the running time for this is true entertainment 
since the j r r tolkien authored books lodged itself as one of the most read books of the century the lord of the rings trilogy has long been considered unfilmable theres a very good reason for this the trilogy is practically a universe unto itself with dense subplots poems languages and characters to scare even cecil b demille fortunately peter jackson took on the herculean task and gave viewing audiences something that is very rare in american cinema big action adventure movie in which ground breaking special effects take a back seat to plot character development and moral vision the film does not disappoint on any level although some of tolkiens more beloved characters are left out jackson still manages to strike the perfect balance between placating the fans and attracting neophytes although i had never read the books before watching the film because of the films i have become a devoted lotr fan for a film of its length and extent of plot fellowship of the ring is still immensely watchable in brief buy it today you wont be disappointed and the dvd extras provide an even better appreciation for this masterpiece 
this is one of the few movies ive seen that does justice to the book it represents true it doesnt follow the story exactly but peter jackson did about as good a job as you can expect anyone to do in three hours this movie is incredible there simply is nothing to complain about the acting is superb with several cast members giving the performance of a lifetime the special effects are breathtaking and the stunts and fight scenes very memorable this film captivates you from the very start when it tells the story of the rings and holds you until the last moment where we are left to wonder about the fate of the scattered fellowship well those who never read the books at least i knew this film was a masterpiece when my wife who hates the fantasy genre insisted on seeing it times in theaters there is nothing but pure perfection in this film and doubtless it will become as classic and legendary as the book that inspired it 
ive read the books watched the cartoons even played the old snes game of lotr so when it came to the theaters i went to see it and im really impressed with it i was amazed at how these people recreated jrr tolkiens world of the hobbits it was exactly how i had always imagined it would be this is a fantasy story that young and old alike will love its a tad long but well worth watching i highly recommend it to everyone 
 fellowship of the ring is the first of the three movies making up the cinema version of the novel lord of the rings by philologist j r r tolkien this is one of the most influential popular novels of the th century other bases of big motion pictures such as ben hur and gone with the wind cant hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script for starters lord of the rings has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid s to the present while i suspect practically no one reads lew wallaces ben hur any more and few people have recently read margaret mitchells gone with the wind it is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes or movies by itself they do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters location and history the lord of the rings is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid s one virtue we did get from the division into three titles by tolkien is that peter jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to hours of viewing time there is simply no way the whole story could be squeezed into three hours ralph bakshis attempt to do it in the early s was a total failure peter jackson can thank his lucky stars that so many people in his audience were familiar with the novel otherwise the cliffhanger ending to the fellowship of the ring could have easily killed any interest in the movie rather than as it did enhance expectations for the second and third installments i can still remember overhearing a fellow audience member muttering that he wanted his money back upon leaving the theatre after seeing frodo and sam paddle off across the anduin merry and pippin being rushed off to orthanc and aragorn gimli and legolas dispairing over the collapse of the fellowship this is not to say that the fellowship of the ring is not without its rewards with all of the truly demoniac scenes in the second and third movies not to mention gandalfs heroic stand against the balrog in the mines of moria i really find the single scariest moment in the whole movie to be the one i read on a dark saturday night alone in our house while the dark riders on their black horses were chasing frodo seated on a white horse in front of the elven warrior glorfindel as he races towards the river guarding the approaches to rivendell it is no surprise that this scene is one of the most powerful in jacksons movie jackson even improves on the scene by replacing the mighty warrior glorfindel with the very slender delicate looking arwen who would seem to not have the snowballs chance in hell elven magic or no elven magic standing against the nine black riders for me jackson has ably captured virtually every scene he touched by matching or improving on my imagination he does a similarly excellent job with enhancing the most important event in the whole book the confrontation with the balrog and the apparent loss of gandalf and as many have said before the new zealand scenery played a major role in helping to breath life into the words can anything have done so well in realizing the misty mountains while almost all the scenes in the two towers made it to the screen important parts of both the return of the king and the fellowship of the ring were understandably left behind when the film was done oddly the single most interesting character of the volume tom bombadil was practically the only significant character left out of the movie bombadil is quite the deux ex machina as he rescues the four hobbits from their first two perils without being given much of an introduction even by know it all gandalf bombadil only crops up one afterward in the council of elrond where it is said that if the magic ring is given to him he will probably loose it and just as he was the first he will be the last to disappear under the shadow cast by ubervillain sauron in all my readings of tolkien bombadil has always been the most elusive and interesting character even more so than the wizards as the wizards the elves and every other creature in middle earth with the possible exception of the ents is subject to the evil of the ring this suggests that all the peoples of middle earth except bombadil and the ents are immigrants from somewhere else the silmarillion tells in great detail how the elves came to middle earth and it is clear that the wizards and the men of gondor and arnor came from places beyond middle earth but not bombadil whats more bombadil seems to have power over the ring as he seems to make it disappear before the hobbits eyes bombadil and his soul mate goldberry seem to be great archetypes for the hippie counterculture of the s in fact of all the characters in lord of the rings the contrast between bombadil and gandalf are two of the most interesting archetypes relevant to modern humans i certainly have less trouble identifying with these two than with the diminutive hairy toed hobbits while the driving energy of the story comes from the need to overthrow the great evil sauron the greatest interest comes from battles of conscience on a much more human scale as it occurs in boromir gollum faramir theoden and frodo baggins the most important instance in this film is the struggle of boromir between his sworn allegiance to the quest of the fellowship versus his fealty to his father denethor steward of gondor 
the first part of the lord of the rings trilogy the fellowship of the ring opened the door to a whole new world for me id never read any of tolkiens books when i saw the film for the first time at the theatre and now that ive read them in retrospect i think being a neophyte to the mythology made my lotr movie experience all the more miraculous i loved the two towers and return of the king almost as much as fotr but not quite because seeing fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you dont want to leave ive never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me it was akin to being a child again with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings and whatever age you are when you watch the fellowship of the ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of middle earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of eisengard saruman sauron and all of their mighty malice one of the things that makes this movie so special and there are so many is that you fall in love not only with the good characters but also with some of the evil ones for example christopher lee was amazing as saruman and i cant imagine the movie without him for those of you who havent seen it yet what are you waiting for films that might be comparable to the lord of the rings trilogy are the fifth element the star wars trilogy parts iv v and vi forget the newer prequels the matrix trilogy especially the first part interview with a vampire the legend of sleepy hollow with johnny depp logans run and the island they are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime but after seeing the fellowship of the ring i knew i had found the movie by which i would judge all other movies based on j r r tolkiens beloved books peter jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema one that i honestly think has not and wont be surpassed at least not in my lifetime not even by pj himself it is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come and this collectors gift set is probably the best way to date of marketing the movie with the lovely stone like argonath bookends the extended edition of the movie which although i thought it was impossible at first actually improves on the theatrical version and the extra goodies that come inside like the national geographic documentary on the making of the keepcase and the beautiful outer packaging itself god bless tolkien and jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film for creating a world that is at my fingertips only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever i want and makes me forget everything else fotr will always be my most precious of all movies 
this is a wonderful movie i have seen it at least times i am glad i could rent it on amazon 
as a long time lotr fan i eagerly awaited the first movie although it quickly became one of my favorite movies of all time i still lamented some of the detail that was left out i understood that it had to be edited and that no exhibitor would ever book a hour movie at normal ticket prices when i heard the first information on this edition i decided to forego the first dvd release and get this one instead the wait was worth it although there are still a few details missing and a few things to quibble about the result is simply stunning and can stand in its own right three and one half hours of this movie is quite simply worth the investment in time id recommend this to all fans of the original book an audience thats proven its willingness to invest the time to get the most out of the experience im more anxious than ever to see quot the two towers quot and then to get its extended edition in the history of movie quot franchises quot this is the crown jewel a breathtaking accomplishment if peter jackson never did another noteworthy thing in his life this alone would elevate him to a legendary status comparable to his source material his ability to bring this story vividly to life is almost as awesome as tolkiens in writing it in the first place see also my review of the book where i state my opinion thats its the greatest work of fiction in the english language not excluding shakespeare i have no doubt that all three movies when theyve been released both thearically and in their extended editions will prove among the most profitable and enduring ever filmed i only hope that sometime along the way the academy sees fit to reward them with something more than technical oscars did i mention that i really liked it 
 quot we can make them longer stronger better quot when peter jackson said this about the extended dvd versions of the films im sure hordes of movie fans disagreed they were wrong the lord of the rings trilogy is quite possibly the best thing thats ever happened to the movie industry and these extended version dvds are the best things to ever happen to dvd players this first installment was great in the theater but the extended version is better several things are explained in greater detail and you cant tell where new material has been inserted its flawless from the acting to the music to the scenery i cant say enough good things about this movie oh yeah the extras are nice too 
many dvds in the past several months have been very good but there is only one that can be known as the best this dvd is probably the best one i have seen the special features are amazing as is the uncut version of the film so much of this dvd is breathtaking the movie and especially some bonuses the one titled quot weta digital quot and quot scale quot are both truly amazing they also have pre visual computer annimation of severla scenes compared to the film thats just one disc i have spent about four hours watching bonus features and it seems as if ive hardly grazed the surface its taken me many weeks to do that much thats disc four disc three while not as interesting as disc four is still amazing it tells so much of the story and the adaptation process the uncut movie is amazing and theres more of gollum who is so cool the dvd is amazing and there are some cool hidden surprises one is about a minute theatrical preview of quot the two towers quot which shows several scenes that never made it into the actual quot two towers quot film also there is a spoof of the concil of elrond made by mtv this dvd is amazing and it fits well with the amazing movie buy this dvd you wont be dissapointed 
after many long years of waiting for some visionary producer director to take up the monumental task of translating the greatest fantasy trilogy ever written to the big screen peter jackson finally answered the call and expertly brought tolkiens interior vision into a cinematic manifestation beyond belief could there be a more perfect beginning to this trilogy of films than the fellowship of the ring the cast is excellent the storyline faithful to the book the soundtrack exquisite and the special effects unlike anything to come before it there has never been anything quite like it except of course for the two towers and the return of the king soon to follow that would complete the lord of the rings saga unquestionably one of the essentials to any dvd collection 
there are so many reasons to own this version i cant touch on them all here the new minutes of footage are used well it slows the pace of the film down making the film feel less frantic so that when youre in the shire you get to dwell there a bit longer absorbing the feel of the place and getting to know more about the peaceful ways of the hobbits much more detail is given about middle earth taking it a step closer to tolkiens vision lothlorien which seemed all but glossed over in the theatrical release is seen as it should be from afar golden and mysterious and were given the added pleasure of spending a bit more time there at last we get to see the gifts of the elves which makes sense later when they are used it is wonderful to see each of the fellowships interaction with galadriel cate blanchett who is given considerably more screen time the hints of tolkiens fondness of songs and the shots of the band of hobbits and men sharing meals around the fire serve to fill in the feel of the books as well as deepen character development both aragorn and borimirs character are more fleshed out by the added scenes then there are scenes of great beauty such as the sam and frodos first glimpse of the elves which may not advance the plot but are breathtakingly gorgeous this is a rich must have item to watch over and over image and sound are first rate an added bonus is the appendices which are voluminous and informative in here youll find everything you wanted to know aboiut how this film was put together from conception to finished production everything about this version is first class even the elaborate packing replete with gorgeous drawings from the world of tolkien highly recommended
well this movie blew me away on two different fronts first the film itself is a masterpiece i personally think lotr has already surpassed any potential present in either star wars trilogy the complexity of characters production design acting and cinematography were far above anything i have seen in a fantasy film before if by some strange chance you have not yet seen this film please go and see it as soon as possible that brings me to my second point see it on this dvd this is what dvd should be like for every film made first the film itself has deleted scenes inserted into their proper places in the film and unlike some deleted material this is actually worth seeing it adds background story to the main narrative and in some cases just looks amazing also it is followed by two dvds of informative humorous bonus material that answers some of the quot howd they do that quot questions that i had after seeing the film finally the film is accompanied by four different audio commentaries each of which is actually worth listening to compared to the audio commentaries i have heard before most of which sound like the director and stars drunkenly discussing the film at a bar after shooting has just finished these are informative and amusing this dvd is an incredible bargain and it is also a chance to own one of the cinematic milestones in fantasy film 
ok ive been an avid tolkien fan since when i read the hobbit and the three sequels the fellowship of the ring the two towers and the return of the king back in the late s an attempt was made to adapt these books into films or rather the hobbit and return of the king were though good in themselves these films were a great disappointment to avid fans of tolkien there were those that saw the movies and were ever afterward convinced that tolkiens work could never be adapted to film in a satisfactory manner then along came peter jackson i dont remember exactly when he began work on this project but it was his goal to turn each of the three lord of the rings novels into a movie and not to make just one movie for them all this in my opinion was a good idea not only that with technology being considerably more advanced now than it was at the time of the first lotr movie much more could be done with it to say that this is a very good movie would be something of an understatement even though i cant see and therefore cant appreciate the visuals i was much more impressed with this adaptation partly its because jacksons choice of actors was right on though i never imagined elijah wood as a hobbit he does an excellent job of capturing frodo while ian mckellan is perfect in the shoes of gandalf christopher lee is also perfect for the role of saruman the plot is right out of tolkiens book ive heard people say they hated this movie because it didnt include every little thing from the book but those are fanatics you couldnt include everything from one of tolkiens books in a movie without adding unnecessarily to the playing time the music in this film is some of the best ive heard since the star wars films whoever was the composer must really have had tolkien in mind the only other recent movie whose soundtrack really caught my attention is harry potter and the sorcerers stone and that films score was composed by the same guy who did the star wars music the sound effects were also very excellent though not a perfect adaptation of the novel as i said you couldnt do that without totally ruining the movie this is definitely well worth the money to name some of the films high points the duel between gandalf and saruman at the top of the tower of orthank it wasnt included in the book but it fit right in in fact the movie goes into a bit more detail than even the novel did jackson must have also read the silmarillion i recommend that you rent this movie and watch it then buy it if it meets with your standards i admit i was a little dubious but the excitement outweighed that by a considerable amount 
love these movies and having a blu ray is essential to me unlike many here i already had the dvd and extended and just wanted blu ray i also like having the theatrical because most times i dont have hours for an extended 
 fellowship of the ring ho lee cow thats all ive got to say about that i was so impressed by this movie that its hard to put into words the sets and secenery were breathtaking its really amazing that they were able to convincingly re create an imaginary world so vividly the castles the mountains and forests everything was truly amazing something else that bears mentioning are the visual tricks they used to make normal sized people appear as hobbits who are about half the size of a man nowhere in the movie does it fail i couldnt even tell what they were doing most of the time but whatever it was it worked flawlessly the costumes were unreal the monsters looked monstrous that seems like a little thing but i consider myself a pretty tough guy and some of them scared me a little bit the scale of the large battle scenes was unbelievable you can tell yourself that theyre created with computers but when you see it onscreen it doesnt look like it seamless is the best word for it the computer imagery was completely integrated into the movie if nobody wins an oscar for this something is seriously wrong with the academy voters the smaller fight scenes were also incredibly well done yeah its hack n slash but its well done hack n slash and thats a okay in my book theyre really violent there will be several moments where youll sit in your seat and go whoa its not for the squeamish all the actors did a great job special props go to ian mckellan sean astin and sean bean mckellan was to gandalf what patrick stewart was to professor xavier namely a man who seemed born to play this role astin played another hobbit sam gamgee forget the goonies or license to drive or any of the other s stuff he was in he was totally convincing and even though im a huge devotee of all things s i had no trouble buying him in his role bean is one of my favorite actors based on his work in the british film versions of the sharpe novels going into this movie i was afraid he was going to play another sleazeball like he did in goldeneye and patriot games but boromir wound up being one of my favorite characters yes he was flawed but he ultimately found redemption so bean can hopefully avoid being typecast as a villain wait until you finish reading this then get up and go see this movie right now but you should be prepared that this is obviously the first part of a trilogy theres a huge cliffhanger at the end so youll be wishing it was christmas already i know i am 
if you love fantasy or tolkien or just superb filmmaking do yourself a favor and ignore the inane critical reviews below lotr is brilliant a wonderful departure of epic proportions from the typical hollywood garbage that floods screens of the time peter jackson should be commended for having the brass to bring this trilogy to the big screen and pulling off the first episode so well the whole film completely draws you into the fellowships quest and adventures fans of the fantasy genre have been waiting uh forever for an oscar worthy fantasy film and have finally been given our masterpiece from beginning to end the film rocks casting is outstanding highlighted by ian mckellans portrayal of gandalf and viggo mortensens vigorous turn as aragorn sean bean john rhys davies christopher lee and elijah wood also turn in excellent performances while not complete unknowns it was nice to see a director who refused to cast morons like keanu reeves sarah michelle gellar and freddie prinze in roles they have no business being near i could only imagine what lotr wouldve looked like if some hollywood lame o like joel shumacher or speilberg got their grubby paws on it the action is well paced not overblown yet not slow either the plot is set up well and the storyline is completely understandable and sensical enough of the book is put into the script to flesh out tolkiens world without being overly talky special effects shine as well the balrog is incredible the watcher is fearsome the scenes with the wraiths while frodo is wearing the ring are macabre and surreal the battle in the mines of moria with the orcs cave troll is awesome as is the army of orcs saurumon raises the scenery is lavish and fantasic most notably rivendell and moria the sound on the dvd is great my widescreen dolby digital disc actually sounds like dts through my home theater system extras are nice if some are a bit repetitive if you must have the collectors set by all means go ahead but the widescreen dvd is all most of you will need peter jackson is an extremely underrated director and deserves more acclaim while churning out gems like the frighteners and dead alive in apparent anonymity he needs to be heralded for pulling off the seemingly impossible making lotr into a brilliant film experience forget a beautiful mind if the clowns in hollywood werent so averse to straying from the predictable lotr shouldve garnered best picture best director along with its other awards lotr is a masterpiece a brilliant fantasy epic this is no doubt the best film i have ever seen in my life and certainly the best film in the near barren wasteland of the fantasy genre it blows gladiator away hands down a must own film 
i am not the type of person that enjoys watching films with a dungeon and dragons feel to them but after an awful lot of hype and seeing the advertisement on tv enough times to know each scene in order i decided to watch the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring earlier today i rented it with some mates and sat down for almost three hours and by the end had just witnessed the greatest film my year old eyes have ever seen nominated for academy awards and walking away with only earlier in the year i was left dazzled gripped and entranced by this epic film at million the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring overtook titanic as the most expensive film to produce of all time they made their moneys worth though as the film has grossed almost billion in less than a year it rocketed straight to no on the uk vhs dvd chart on sunday th august shifting more than million copies in its first week to become the fastest selling film of all time in the uk outselling the previous record set by titanic for million in september director peter jackson surpasses himself with the sheer size of middle earth j r r tolkeins classic novel of the lord of the rings trilogy always represented me with the challenge of imagining just how big middle earth is but jackson seems to have got the size just right its just how i and im sure the majority of other fans imagined it would be an ancient ring thought lost for centuries has been found and through a strange twist in fate has been given to a small hobbit named frodo when gandalf discovers the ring is in fact the one ring of the dark lord sauron frodo must make an epic quest to the cracks of doom in order to destroy it however he does not go alone he is joined by gandalf legolas the elf gimli the dwarf aragorn boromir and his three hobbit friends merry pippin and samwise through mountains snow darkness forests rivers and plains facing evil and danger at every corner the fellowship of the ring must go their quest to destroy the one ring is the only hope for the end of the dark lords reign elijah wood plays a convincing frodo baggins but spends most of his screen time frowning looking confused yet determined to return the ring and destroy it ian mckellen makes the most of his role as gandalf as does cate blanchett she doesnt have much screen time but is pure and fresh in her role as galadriel liv tyler as arwen undomiel ian holm as bilbo baggins and christopher lee as saruman the white are all exceptional in their roles there really isnt an actor on this film that isnt superb and spot on the whole film is so action packed gripping suspenseful and tense there are shocks and twists a plenty that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the final scene the sheer size and volume of middle earth is breathtaking and spectacular and the fight scenes are fantastically choreographed with superb amazingly life like special effects overall grade all in all the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is the greatest film of all time i am not the biggest fan of fantasy films star wars are in my opinion junk but the fellowship of the ring has gone straight to no in my list of all time favourite films knocking back films with the horror comedy and drama theme along the way i cant wait until the lord of the rings the two towers in december and the third enstallment the lord of the rings the return of the king but i think it will be an extremely difficult task to follow up on the first one if you havent seen the fellowship of the ring you have to buy it rent it borrow it heck it for crying out loud whatever method takes your fancy this is the must see film of the st century so far harry potter the sorcerers stone is inferior and mediocre in comparison to lotr and everyone i know who has seen it liked this one better that potter the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is truly a classic and epic film is cinema history that will stand out as the greatest film ever made buy it from amazon now 
 quot the fellowship of the ring quot is a great movie all in all and i dont see how one can not like it or better yet love it the whole imagery and setting is beautiful in every way as for the special effects you cant criticize it because the visual images are all very convincing and i was very impressed by how they made the hobbitts look the right size although i have read only the first few pages of the book i was a little worried that the normal sized actors would be too big the special affects however made the hobbitts look as small as they are supposed to it looks very real of course what matters in this movie is not necessarily the images but really the whole mood feeling and excitement of the movie even one who hasnt read the books can sense the evil of the one ring and how it influences the characters and heroes any person who possesses or wears the ring is driven mad by its powers and even the good are corrupted by the tempting powers of invisibility and to control others elijah wood deserves a great deal of credit for how well he plays the hero frodo who is given the burden of the ring and experiences the dark images of the rings evil powers it is very dark and dramatic the way it is all done the subtleness and tensity is all too great and never been exceeded in any other movie ive seen although quot princess mononoke quot comes close all of the actors do deserve praise for how well theyve done with tolkiens characters some favorite scenes of mine include the flight to the ford to escape the dark rider the fight on the tower where frodo gets stabbed the setting of lothlorien with the mystical queen galadrial the meeting of arogorn and arwnen and the ending scenes known as the breaking of the fellowship the music itself is very grand as howard shores score helps add to the enchantment and magic of the movie not to mention the celtic quot goddess quot enya whose music has enchanted many around the world shes my all time favorite singer for some reason i have felt like comparing this movie to the harry potter film probably because of the cruel critics who have well i do find both quot fellowship quot and quot harry potter quot to be both magical in every way with setting story characters and mood to all complainers who complained about quot harry potter quot being too scary quot fellowship quot is mega scary and many times more scary than quot harry potter quot my nine year old brother handled this movie very well but i dont think my five year old sister would have been able to handle it quot fellowship quot is also much long as quot harry potter quot quickly moves from scene to scene but quot fellowship quot stays longer with certain scenes at first i couldnt decide which i liked more quot harry potter quot or quot fellowship quot but i did find quot fellowship quot to be more lively and enchanting for that reason i like quot fellowship quot a bit more but even so there is still plenty of room for quot harry potter quot i will on the other hand have to read the whole book to see how well the movie follows along i do expect both quot harry potter quot and quot fellowship quot to recieve many oscar nominations and surely some winners if not there will be great outrage anyway in the end i highly recommend going out and seeing this movie youll miss out on a lot of magic if you dont 
with reviews and climbing as of my writing theres little chance of anybody reading what i have to say so whats the point i will say this watching this volume set the extended editions was the most comprehensively satisfying cinematic experience of my life 
not being a big fan of the mid evil dungeons and dragons genre i did not go to see lord of the rings in theaters and certainly never read the books but when i saw that it was coming on video i decided to rent it at my local video store not really expecting too much but after about the first ten minutes i knew i was wrong this movie is amazing everything about this movie is great the story the acting the cinematography everything the first thing that struck me about the movie was the wonderful character of gandalf or maybe it was the wonderful performance by sir ian mckellen or maybe it was both either way the character of gandalf the white was my favorite of the movie the second thing that caught my eye was the excellent cinematography from the shots of the opening battle in the prologue to the beautiful colors of the shire the greens of the trees and grass the browns of the dirt and mud and also how the hobbits looked normal size when shot by them selves only when they appear in a shot with a human or an elf do we see theyre actual size after frodo set off on his quest and met new allies and adversaries i was amazed to find that i liked every character in the movie from the kind and truthful hobbits to the short but mighty dwarfs every character seemed to perfectly into the action every actor seemed to fit perfectly into his or her roll especially the character of sam who for the most part stayed out of the lime light of the movie but when he was in the spot light showed that he was a brave but knew when to speak up or shut up i would also like to mention christopher lees performance as saruman while i liked it immensely i thought lees portrayal as count dooku in the latest star wars installment attack of the clones was a little better one of the best qualities of the film was how it never seemed to me at least to slow and or become boring even when there wasnt any action the great dialogue keeps you watching and the end of the movie leaves you thinking that was three hours the only minuscule complaint that i had is the to be continued ending which if its and you have the other two movies available to watch is not that big of a problem but when its still and you have to wait another year or two for the final installments its a bit aggravating but what are you going to do its based on a book and authors dont usually take into consideration that theyre story might be a movie someday i suppose i should also mention the director peter jackson to be perfectly honest i had never heard of him before but if he makes other movies as well as he made this one he is one of the best directors in hollywood after the movie was over i sat there wishing i could watch the final two installments of the trilogy and i knew it was one of the best movies i had ever seen if it is not already the lord of the rings trilogy will become a classic in the years to come 
i loved this movie and i cant wait to see the sequel get yours today because it is a classic 
as we pull up to the theater the line stretches out into the parking lot the people are filled with restless nervous anticipation talking quietly amongst themselves fortunately dallas has arrived early and i find my place saved at the head of the line the air almost crackles with the intensity a murmur passes through the crowd when at last the doors are unlocked and the restless viewers begin to forge inside our tickets are purchased our seats are found eventually the trailers begin the theater is packed all seats after being plagued with spiderman and a terrible austen powers spin off the screen fades to darkness we shudder with a sudden thrill as the voice over the voice we would learn to acknowledge as that of queen galadriel begins the story of the ring its forging in the mountains of doom its empowerment by the dark lord and its keepers we are swept into a story unlike any other a story of many characters and places of much depth and insight but also a story of elves and dwarves humans and hobbits a story that has earned itself rightfully the title of quot book of the century quot in the three hours that come about we laugh we cry we are scared absolutely out of our wits the time flies by without hesitation or fear plunging ahead into middle earth with incredible aerial shots and stunning cinematography the audience is in awe of the elves terrified by the cave troll grossed out by the birth of an orc from the depths of the ground itself they gasp in fear as gandalf is suddenly attacked by an unexpected enemy they cheer when arwen brings down the flood upon the dark riders they draw back in surprise and sudden fear at the temptation of galadriel all breaths are drawn in as one when the enemy infiltrates the prancing pony and let out in a roar when an orc is defeated and then as the screen fades to black and the credits role it begins one clap here another there until it breaks forth into thundering applause the audience who was wowed with gladiator who shunned the patriot who stood in awe of the matrix have discovered for the first time the spellbinding storytelling of tolkien and the absolute magic at the fingertips of the filmmakers as i exit the theater i hear many things words such as quot incredible quot quot awesome quot quot cool quot and quot oscar quot the words that will spread from lips into ears across the nation and send lord of the rings into a complete and total bock office success but it is only later that the true test of the film begins it endures in discussion over a late very late luncheon at chilis all aspects are explored from the hideousness of the orcs to the angelic tendencies of the elves even a characters intentional sacrifice for another the ring is deeply studied from every aspect its character even more powerfully drawing than that of frodo or gandalf all are in agreement that the film is a masterpiece as we gather up our things and bid farewell we leave with only one thought in mind tolkien would have approved 
tolkien would be very pleased were he around to see his masterpiece come to life on the big screen i dont know who the director peter jackson is but he has done an incredible job of capturing the look and feel of the book so much attention to detail from lighting to special effects to sound and music the action sequences are refreshingly original and well interspersed throughout the movie casting was surprisingly well done there was not one person that did not fit their role this is a book to movie done right 
i was reluctant to see this film only because i couldnt get into the books but at the urging of a number of people whose judgment i trust i finally saw it and what an extraordinary accomplishment this is that it didnt win an academy award for best picture is beyond shocking losing as it did to the very flawed a beautiful mind here is a film that is rich in every aspect from the superb casting and lovely performances to fearsomely exhilarating special effects to a narrative that is made entirely believable by fine directing fine editing beautiful costuming and exceptional cinematography its a rivetting movie that succeeds in every way and one neednt be a fan of fantasy to enjoy it this is one of the rare efforts that transcends its genre and is simply a great movie not to be missed most highly recommended 
truly this is the best picture of the year though not the extended edition i do own both and i felt compelled to review this one kudos to peter jackson for surfacing through the muck of the off the wall and quite ridiculous films he used to make thank god his artistry and vision made for a compelling motion picture this film employed some of the best on screen talents first one of the greatest actors of all time sir ian mckellan shines in a role he should for which he should have won best supporting actor orlando bloom shone through in his breakout performance and got even better in the two towers funny since they were filmed at the same time and viggo mortenson is the dark horse hero the unexpected sex symbol in a very powerful role protraying a very deep character his is also a performance worth and oscar nomination sean astin and elijah wood were great but convinving me that hobbits were real the cinematography was astounding filmed in one of the most beautiful places on earth australia the sweep and scope of the camera angles and sceneic images are awe inspiring and breath taking the visuals are mind boggling the creatures that were created and the make up used on the humans goblins and orcs and what not was astounding the hobbit feet though gross are painstakingly applied and mastered so to speak even though their feet meticulous peter jackson like michael mann and his native american costumes in the last of the mohicans the script stayed true to the classic fairy tale using many of tolkiens timeless word it was definitely a faithful adaptation of the literary classic trilogy its is a subtle allegory to the bible and much of it is allegorical to the first world war however the allegory of c s lewiss the chronicles of narnia is more evident the score is superb everyone seems to have a theme song the hobbits have a happy little ditty that demonstrates their generally jovial nature and happy lifestyle the fairys have floaty numbers airy and sweet very passionate the dark forces of saruman are represnted by percussion driven songs very deep dark and sinister sounding as for the end it leaves you hanging if you havent read the classic trilogy youre gonna be mad but youre gonna be on the edge of your seat because you want to keep watching and you just cant wait for the next event to happen but you found out you had to wait a year or a few weeks days whenever depending on when you first saw fellowhsip but the towers is well worth the wait all in all the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is the best picture of unfortunately a boring mind stole the prize from the rigtful winner but i wont let that get me down and neither should you this is science fiction fantasy as at its very best and can only be outdone by the rest of the movies in its own trilogy this is a film with few peers and is truly a landmark of cinema not just for the finished product but also for the uncommon practice of the process of shooting all three movies at the same time this is a film that you should not miss a story of triumph over adversity loyalty faith devotion romance and good over evil this is a outstanding film and i give it my highest recommendation possible 
i bought all of these extended sets and even without even watching a single extras disc which i plan to one day after retirement the enhancing of the original film here and the other two is splendid weve watched the original version off and on on tv and we see whats missing pretty easily from this extended version finally a director took special care to weave in a half hour or so of excellent material that could not be tolerated in short attention span movie theaters if it comes to town for the big screen well be there cuz if any film is a big screen movie this trilogy is god bless 
this was a truly excellent movie no doubt about it anyone who is still waiting to go see this should definitely go it is a wonderful piece of movie making and a treat for anyone who loves movies as a visual rendering of tolkiens masterwork fellowship of the ring is wonderfully evocative of the spirit of tolkien and this i think is why peter jackson should have won the best director nod from the oscars if a beautiful mind won for subject matter then lotr fotr was a far better piece of filmic creativity lotr is about power and the way that power corrupts the task of defeating the greatest and most evil entity in middle earth is destined to fall upon the least conventionally heroic of peoples the rustic english countryside dwelling hobbits who love food smoking and running around barefoot to save the wiser more war like and subtler races of the free peoples of middle earth frodo and his servant sam must overcome evil not by head on confrontation but by destroying the dark lord saurons ultimate source of power his gold ring the drama of lotr cannot be denied the scenery and the cinematography were breathtaking the second age battles at the beginning of the movie and the over flights of sarumans transformation of isengard particularly stand out and the action scenes while a little sensationalized for the video game audience were pretty gutsy the combat scenes in particular had much more of the feel of hand to hand fighting than sword and sandal travesties like gladiator that said i did have a couple of moments of disconnect with the movie one was the silly wizards duel between gandalf and saruman it looked more like buffy the vampire slayer than tolkien the other was the petulance of elrond although i very much enjoyed agent smiths portrayl of the elf lord he seemed a much less impressive character than he was in the book still in the final analysis lotr is not about the individual characters except frodo sam and smeagol gollum as a work of literature and as the ur father of fantasy novels it is about big ideas and this is where for my money peter jacksons talent really comes through on one level lotr both the movie and the books are just good entertaining fun but on another level there are deeper and more disturbing issues as many scholars have pointed out tolkiens story was about the denial of power rather than the triumphant use of it its a story with deep humanistic and religious roots tolkien himself refuted the idea that lotr was about the atom bomb but there are more than enough interesting links between tolkien and milton for us to see that the central issue for tolkien was the nature of good and evil and the way in which humanity via its various avatars elves humans wizards dwarves hobbits and even orcs come to terms with the demands of both good and evil as guiding forces in the world it should be noted in these more multicultural times that tolkiens moral universe was a thoroughly english form of christianity and a mixture of late th century and dark ages christianity at that one of the most important differences between tolkien and the more simplistic versions of fantasy that make up the bulk of what came after the publication of the lord of the rings is tolkiens insistence on the inevitability and sadness of endings even if the good guys win much will be sacrificed and the world as the protagonists know it will come to an end this is most evident in his handling of the elves but also in figures such as aragorn who is shown not as a young man in the glorious morning of adulthood as he would be in almost any other fantasy authors hands but as a guy who is definitely a little the worse for wear and tear even if he can still decapitate orcs with the best of them this is not walt disneys world of primary colors or john wayne style westerns with unambiguous good guys and bad guys in fact in tolkiens universe the good are often hampered by their own deficiencies or tempted by their own delusions or disabled by the treachery of erstwhile allies the bad guys often unwittingly facilitate their own doom through the same kinds of in fighting and mutual suspicion no one in lotr has absolute moral clarity and that i think is part of tolkiens creative genius through careful casting camera work and scripting jackson has been able to capture this essential ingredient in tolkiens middle earth cate blanchetts galadriel and above all ian mckellans gandalf embody this to the tips of their boots huge cheers for the whole cast and the technical crew for this movie tolkiens spirit goes on into the new millennium 
wow this is easily the best dvd ever made this movie does an amazing job of bringing tolkien to life on the big screen not everything is perfect and true fans will probably find something to complain about but overall you wont be disappointed this film is a very faithful adaption with fine acting visuals straight from tolkiens favorite artists and dialoge right of the books this special extended version is definitely the best version this is the film for those of you who loved the books who were annoyed at the changes and insane pacing of the theatrical release the extra minutes of material arent just a few deleted scenes here and there but actually hundreds of extra shots and scenes ranging from a few seconds to minutes long the additions arent perfect but mostly good youll find a longer warmer intro to the shire the passing of elves as frodo flees the riders the gifts of galadriel and so on better yet many important scenes are given just a little extra time so that you can enjoy and even understand them better match this with some of the best dvd extras youll ever find a total of commentary tracks plus discs of extras covering every conceivable topic how did they make hobbits so convincingly small included is a wonderful documentary on tolkien himself and the history of this project as the director struggled to get it financed there is a map of middle earth and the journey of the fellowship plus another map of new zealand and which locations were used wonderful special effects montages take you through the multiple layors without having to click through a million still images although those are still there even the still images which i usually hate and avoid give us information and tell a story and the whole thing comes wrapped in a cover that reminds me of my old hardback edition of the book itself as an interesting touch the movie chapter names match the chapter names in the books perfect in every way i strongly recommend anyone that owns a dvd player to buy this dvd 
first i want to say that this is a very good movie i was excited to hear that it was coming to dvd in august and i was all ready to buy it the day it came out untill i read on its offical website that a special addition i e the directors cut with minutes of additional footage included in the film will be released in november making the movie about h mins long wtf they want me to buy the movie and a better dvd version will be released three months later needless to say ill be renting it in aug and buying it in nov so if your like me and you want all the features and see what the director really wanted you to see before he had to cut it down rent it and wait till november 
well it may not have gotten the academy awards for the best picture and best director of but it most certainly should have frankly i think that this wonderful film the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring being produced in new zealand by a wonderful director peter jackson from the uk i believe to be the case did not help it with oscar voters perhaps the votes were close but i still was amazed that this magnificent film walked away with only a handful of oscars and not the major awards i am hopeful that the two towers will bring a long over due academy award nomination to christopher lee as best supporting actor for his role as the wizard saruman which is larger in the two towers after more than fifty years in film christopher lee is now and it would be richly deserved i am not forgetting ian mckellum either hopefully he will win for the return of the king the producers and screenwriters had the difficult task of translating this massive book published almost years ago and most of it written even earlier to the screen and the results do not dissapoint i agree with other viewers that even small deviations from the story can be annoying i was not put off so much by the fact that arwens character stood in for glorfindel but it changed the story since it was at that moment for example that frodo stood up to and defied the lord of the nazgul who breaks frodos sword with his piercing cry incidentally that is one of the reasons bilbo gives frodo sting along with his mail coat the only other major change worth noting was when the fellowship enters moria in the movie version they find the remains of the slain dwarves just inside the gate and then try to double out before they are forced to go on this frankly foreshadows and spoils somewhat the dramatic impact later of the fellowship finding balins tomb and realizing than the the dwarf colony had indeed perished these are not major changes but worth noting most of what we know of the character of arwen evenstar comes from the appendice not the book proper so an attempt was made to weave her more into the story it will not please all purists but frankly it wasnt bad either as far as the dvd release itself i am not overjoyed with the prospect of buying this film twice on dvd but at least through the lotr website and the media the studio and director were very upfront about the dvd releases and exactly what they would contain in advance of either one being offered that is a far better way to do business than most studios who wait until you have bought one dvd edition before releasing even details of a second so enjoy the dvds and i will see you at the movies in december for the premiere of the two towers in the meanwhile i hope those of you who enjoyed the film but still have not read the books will get busy and start reading you will learn a great deal and appreciate the movies all the more best wishes cal
or should i say dvds anyway this movie has something for every person the only people ive talked to who hated this movie were ignornant teenagers who raved about xxx the awful vin diesel movie you perve or the new matrix movie just admit that it served no purpose and that one wachowski brother is seriously nuts just buy this dvd set why are you reading this review this movie is a freakin masterpiece you should know that buy it come on you want the commentaries the extra minutes the featurettes buy one of the best movies ever made i cant stop typing random things zucchini garfield hes fat i get it mogadishu peter gabriel im done please click the buy button then ill stop 
when i first heard about this movie i was reluctant to go i thought the plot was boring and me usually a chick flick and comedy lovers wasnt interested but somehow i was convinced to go turns out this movie was very interesting you must pay attention throughout the movie at every detail or you may get confused later on in the movie this plot is very complex and i still notice things i never did the other times ive seen the movie and ive seen it times besides the adventure there is some comical relief mostly thanks to the character pippin and there are some scenes that can make you very emotional i have cried during some parts of this movie now the plot for those who never read the books i will start off by saying pay attention to the movie you can catch on i personally havent read the books but the movie encouraged me and i am currently reading lotr fotr and i still could pretty much understand what was going on at the begining of the movie there is around minutes of background on how bilbo baggins got the one ring that rules all the other magic rings basically it gives a brief background on bilbo in which was given in the book the hobbit i must admit when i was watching the narrative section of the movie i was afraid it would be like this for the entire movie thus making it a snore fest but dont let the begining fool you it isnt told by a narrator throughout the movie eventually bilbo baggins gives the one ring to frodo his nephew with the help of gandalf the gray all are oblivious at first on what terrible things are impending orcs ring wraiths the black riders and dark lords await them frodo must destroy the ring before sauron gets hold of it or there will be hell on middle earth if you have read the books youll find that the movie ends near the begining of the two towers book i dont know why they do this but i am in a way glad they did this because they have the best battle scene so far now in fotr and im the way done with my book and have noticed many differences but i still believe they did a pretty good job with the movie they had to rearrange some conversations or events into different parts of the movie but they make it work together and give all the neccessary information to understand what is going on i will say that some people may get bored with this but probably most of them didnt pay attention or else dont like movies that either make them think or has no romance well there is maybe a minute romance scene in the entire movie which gives some valueable information if you are a female and totally hate fantasy adventure movies but somehow get inside the theater to see lotr be sure to check out the hobbit frodo played by elijah wood and my personal favorite legolas played by orlando bloom the elf archer and this goes for any age im and i drool over the hot elf but how seen women in their s and s gawking over him the two hotties can most likely help make the movie more tolerable o now i also like the character pippin played by billy boyd who so far seems more stupid than in the book but make no mistake hes hilarious keep an eye out for him and his piffy comments o overall this movie is awesome a must see the only downside is the ending since this is part of a trilogy they leave you with a cliffhanger but the ending isnt exciting it doesnt end with the fellowship surrounded by orcs or anything like that but it still makes you crave for more and i personally can not wait until december to see the next one 
excellent excellent excellent this is what everyone has been waiting for since the release of the animated version which was also quite good elijah wood couldnt have been replaced by another to play frodo one of the most astonishing films of my time and generation peter jackson has done it 
the story itself in lord of the rings is massive some authors will briefly backstory to certain events or why a character reacts a certain way but the author doesnt really go in depth besides maybe a paragraph or so j r r tolkien went nuts going into detail about the backstory to his middle earth that you almost ask is there a point do we really need the backstory of isildurs parents or describing some minor characters activities years before the main story not really the movie manages to trim it out and condense a massive story into an incredibly enjoyable start to a classic trilogy the film starts out with the prologue explaining the backstory of the great rings of power and the one ring created by the dark lord sauron during a big battle in saurons land of mordor the kings successor isildur manages to cut the ring from saurons hand defeating him but the ring actually corrupts your mind like a really bad addiction and it eventually gets him killed because it wanted to be found it ends up being found by smeagol a hobbit who quickly falls under its power and keeps it prolonging his age by a good years or so in the prequel to the books the hobbit bilbo baggins of the shire a country i guess finds the ring only the ring wants to return to sauron the ring passes to his nephew frodo who has to escape the shire since hes hunted by saurons elite force the nazgul also named ringwraiths accompanying him are of his hobbit friends and eventually men frodos wizard friend gandalf an elf and a dwarf in terms of pacing and set design fellowship is definately the best it has the quiet pastoral hobbiton my ideal retirement place rivendell the ethereal majestic lothlorien and the massive dwarf city in moria the amount of detail is rather stunning moreso considering most are actually models minatures nicknamed bigatures due to their size i find certain pacing issues with the next two towers just felt long saved by the intercutting of the ents helms deep scenes return of the king you almost feel like how long ago since i saw that one scene fellowships pacing however is perfect story character scenes are long enough without being watch checking then a big battle will start the characters were wisely chosen although personally orlando bloom looks the part of legolas and can pull off the badassness but his line delivery seems rather flat at times and i dont know if its just me but i couldnt see hugo weaving as the big elf elrond gollum is heard and briefly appears and is seen heavily in next my favorite casting as to be elijah wood bright and smiling at the beginning than really messed up as the story continues i love his expression on the top of weathertop when the ringwraiths appear while the next augment the size and characters fellowship is probably my favorite and shouldnt be passed up 
let me start this review with i am a huge lotr fan and i realize this isnt the extended edition that being said this blu ray rocks this picture and sound quality are excellent this blu ray has two disc the second disc is loaded with extras the menus are nice as would be expected from this movie i would highly recommend this to anyone wanted to see the movie in blu 
here is one film that lived up to its hype and by the time i saw it after it had arrived at the video stores i had heard and read a ton of things about it and seen all the awards it had received and expected a lot to my surprise it did not disappoint now years later after having watched all three of these rings films mulitple times each i still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best and the version to have is the dvd extended version it is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through probably the best ever put to film the sequels were good to be sure but this first had a better mixture of the story the second and third movies were almost entirely frodo and his allies long journey but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the shire before the long adventure starts anyway fellowship stunned me for the visuals alone i cant recall any film that has so many jaw dropping scenes one after the other for three straight hours some are beyond description and i dont care if they are computer generated so what the fact is they are awesome to view both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible looking monsters and other mythical characters the story covers all kinds of terrain too from the lush shire of the hobbits to the harsh neighboring landscapes each couple of minutes as in the two movies that followed scenes radically change from calmness to action adventure to romance sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters on and on and on its an incredible movie experience 
wow i saw the original version several times in the theater then many more times at home on dvd however i probably wont watch the first version again the extended version is so much more balanced and developed its just so amazing what a bit of dialogue here a short scene there will do for character development and plot there are enough extra features included to impress anyone in this set what with four discs included two just for bonus features it seemed to me the sound has been tweaked up a bit or two i was continually turning my volume down on my sound system for fear of offending the neighbors the new chapter quot concerning hobbits quot and the quot gift giving quot sequence were my favorite new parts and really i cant see why they were cut in the first place thankfully peter jackson put what little magic that was cut out back in and made his masterpiece one for the ages i must say if this version were shown theatrically instead of the shorter version it probably would have won the oscar for best picture what most people had negative about the film was the lack of character development this version has it although ill likely never watch it again ill keep my shorter version on dvd but ill watch this extended one from now on 
it goes without saying that some alterations between book and movie had to be made for dramatic purposes but the overall effect is so good so beautifully realized that it is easy to forgive the encapsulation of the early parts of the novel as some things work better in books than in movies and vice versa the characters of the fellowship are magnificently realized and i was surprised and pleased to see the christian messages of the story brilliantly realized without being obtrusive the character of aragorn the king is as allegorical a figure as one could ask for and in this film he even looks like jesus and i loved loved loved the imagery of boromir as a man who finds salvation at the brink of disaster the portrayals of gandalf and the five principle hobbits are inspired casting and legolas gimli are just so right i was less pleased with the elves since elrond seemed sterner than he might have and galadriel was too dark and creepy for the gracious elven queen tolkien created above all the chilling central character in the story is the ring itself with a personality and a voice something never fully realized in the books but magnificently depicted in the film and middle earth itself is a central character with its forboding mountains rolling hills full of hobbit holes and other perfectly depicted locations once youve watched the extended version you will never watch the theatrical release again this extended version is much more tolkienseque more complete and more fun 
ive seen the dvd academy screening copy on a large hdtv set and this is a must have dvd when it comes out for general release the cinematography is beautiful the sets and art direction are both stunning the acting and directing is superb the music is compelling and the story is very deep all great reasons to purchase the dvd and watch it many times i never was a hobbit lord of the rings fan but now i cant wait for the second and third installment to hit the theaters get it 
for those unfamiliar with the book the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring revolves around frodo baggins a hobbit who lives a relatively peaceful life in the village of bag end that is until fate and extraordinary circumstances send him on an important quest in a beautifully conceived prologue it is revealed that in the distant past the dark lord sauron forged a ring with which he could rule middle earth however even though sauron was defeated by an alliance of the humans elves and dwarves the ring was never destroyed allowing sauron to survive and slowly recuperate over several millennia after about years the ring came into the possession of hobbit bilbo baggins ian holm of the sweet hereafter who kept it for sixty years however the ring holds a dark power and it soon begins to exert its evil influence on bilbo under the advice of his long time wizard friend gandalf the grey the ring falls to bilbos young heir frodo who must destroy it by casting it into the fires where it was forged atop mt doom in the dark land of mordor unfortunately not only must frodo avoid saurons soldiers who are scouring middle earth for the ring but he must also avoid the corrupting influence of the ring on both himself and those around him at first frodo is joined by gandalf his best friend sam and cousins merry and pippin however it soon becomes apparent that destroying the ring is the responsibility of all of middle earth and so a fellowship of the ring is formed with the addition of humans aragorn and boromir elf legolas and dwarf gimli and so this party of nine sets out on a difficult journey to mt doom where they must not only contend with the evil forces of sauron but also divisions within the fellowship that threaten to tear it apart a mythic quest magic spells elves a dark lord of evil true these elements are nothing new as they have been seen before in countless other fantasy stories as recently as harry potter and the philosophers stone as well as other genres such as the star wars trilogy however it was the literary works of tolkien such as the lord of the rings trilogy that gave birth to the modern fantasy genre giving it mainstream respectability and influencing a countless number of writers who would follow in his footsteps even strongly influencing other genres as evidenced by the numerous lord of the rings references found in the science fiction series babylon tolkien a major scholar of old and middle english at oxford university had a passion for languages and a keen understanding of mythology and lore and during the thirties and forties he channeled his energies into what would eventually become the lord of the rings trilogy drawing inspiration from ancient lore and age old themes tolkien crafted an entire world on paper with its own history culture and languages crafting a literary masterpiece of unmatched richness and unparalleled depth like the recent harry potter phenomenon lord of the rings achieved cult status first in the united kingdom and it would not be until the s that it would reach the shores of the united states and achieve a similar standing as a film the lord of the rings fellowship of the ring is an astounding achievement jackson who has great respect and admiration for the material has crafted a rousing action adventure that despite its three hour running time never feels long or bloated with the lush natural settings of new zealand breathtaking matte work and the judicious use of cgi the film transports the audience to middle earth a world filled with wonder and spectacle some of the standout sequences include the opening battle scene that sets the stage for the story frodos mountaintop run in with a band of ring wraiths the underground city of moria and a run in with the balrog fire demon and the climactic battle between the fellowship and an army of orcs yet despite such grand and epic sequences the films heart wisely stays close to frodos coming of age and his gradual understanding of the heavy responsibility that has been thrust upon him to bring the characters to life jackson has banded together an all star cast as frodo wood imbues the character with the right balance of innocence vulnerability and conviction reflecting the transformation that the young hobbit undergoes during the course of the film holm is also quite good as the elderly bilbo who yearns to do so much with the little remaining time that he has while astin is likable as frodos ever loyal sidekick mckellan brings a stately presence to the production with his portrayal of gandalf while mortensen conveys the honor and dignity of aragorn among the supporting cast standout performances include a sinister christopher lee star wars episode ii attack of the clones as the fallen wizard saruman hugo weaving the matrix as the elf leader elrond liv tyler armageddon as mortensons love interest arwen and cate blanchett bandits as the beautiful galadriel the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is a fantastic start to a film trilogy and if the next two installments the two towers and the return of the king are of its equal or better lord of the rings may even end up eclipsing the popularity of star wars and the godfather with its stirring story rousing action set pieces strong performances and unparalleled spectacle this ring may very well rule them all tolkien fans your long awaited day of reckoning has truly arrived 
okay let me explain myself the movie is masterful i have loved the trilogy since i was years old but the problem with this particular dvd is the fact that you have to buy this one to really find out what is in the special extended dvd release that will be coming out in november so whats my beef well if i had known what was on the special extended dvd i would have waited so now i have spent sixteen bucks on the regular version and now will have to spend another forty bucks to buy the special extended version in november it would have been nice for the two versions to release at the same time i want to believe that there is a logical explanation for the delayed release but unfortunatley i have to believe that the reason for the two different release dates is to make a couple of extra bucks on the current dvd release they have a great explanation of what will be on the special extended release directors cut so all those who are interested in seeing the incredible film uncut and in its entirety will be forced to fork out around sixty bucks the movie is great this attempt which will succeed to make an extra buck on a franchise that is growing as rapidly as star wars is not 
the first of one of the best book to movie adaptations ever made normally id review the theatrical releases but i never got those and i cant really remember what wasnt in there before i bought this after i saw it theatres the cast captures the characters perfectly especially my favorite christopher lee whose character saruman doesnt feature in the first book at all though i may be wrong its been awhile since i read it he tries to be friendly towards gandalf the part he orginally tried out for and persuade him to join his cause but that ulitimately backfires and switches into evil which the man plays very well elijah wood plays frodo innocent in the world at large and near the end very mistrusting of the rest of the fellowship even sam the extended version captures the book better than what the theatrical release could time constraints being the main problem and im still very glad they didnt try to adapt the whole book as id probably still be in theatres now watching the second movie theres just too many things that slow down the flow of the book and peter jackson trims at the fat and makes the story focus on frodo and his journey and not the many side trips he made like tom bombadil though a cherished character by fans im sure his inclusion wouldve slowed the film down as the hobbits spend quite some time with him even before they get to bree and i think there was an attack on the fellowship by some wolves but then again its been awhile since i read them the action scenes especially the swordsmanship i must point out is some of the best ive seen next to the swordplay in star wars the effects are also top notch both special visual the balrog the cave troll and the opening scene with the thousands of warriors imparticular the make up department something i hardly ever comment on in my reviews i must make a point to congratulate it mustve been painstaking to come up with so many different looks for the orcs and uruk hai howard shores score is one of my favorites the fellowship theme being fantastic and stirs a feeling of heroics within me pretty much the same effect the superman and batmans themes make me feel 
i was completely awestruck the first time i saw lord of the rings in the theater this was the fantasy movie that i had always dreamed of seeing i have been a fantasy fan all my life but strangely enough i had never read the lord of the rings trilogy until i was inspired by the movie i was overawed at the complexity and depth to this book and could not believe that i had not read this earlier in my life now that i have seen this extended edition i cannot believe that they did not release this version the first time i thought that they did a wonderful job on the film before i saw this edition and now the first one seems like a second rate show this is how the all the other movies should be done and i sincerely hope that they are if you love tolkien and the lord of the rings this is a must have 
i have long been a fan of tolkiens lord of the rings trilogy as well as its precursor the hobbit after seeing the long awaited film today i am completely amazed peter jackson is to be commended for creating a faithful exciting visually stunning film version of the fellowship of the ring while the movie does have its flaws they are so small as to not be worthy of mention and also the flaws are inherent in trying to condense such a long book into a film the most noticable loss is of tom bombadil and goldberry as well as the barrow wights they are completely skipped and yet the film does not suffer for it my only major complaint is that the film seems a bit rushed yes even at three hours but i suppose that couldnt be helped i highly recommend this film for all fantasy fans but especially for fans of tolkiens books hurrah for peter jackson 
i really did enjoy the theatrical release of fellowship and thought that along with many others that new line was doing different dvd releases of the film to cash in on the fans i still decided to pick up the extended version and i feel like it was a good use of my hard earned money first of all the extra minutes are well used really expanding on the characters and the world of middle earth i dont really mind the fact that its on two discs its like the intermission that the epic films like lawrence of arabia and cleopatra had its a chance to stretch ones legs a bit it probably would have been impossible to fit the commentaries the dolby audio track and a dts audio track along with the hour film without the quality suffering the picture and audio quality are great because the film is spread out a bit the actors that were cast in this film are fantastic ian mckellen christopher lee and viggo mortensen are particularly convincing in their roles the commentaries are a treasure for the film buff or aspiring film maker it is facinating to hear different angles on the film the two discs of documentaries are superb i cant recall any dvd release covering the film making process in such detail watching the documentaries makes me admire peter jackson even more than before he is a man who genuinely admires tolkiens work he is not doing this to cash in if he truly wanted to cash in he could have just gone to australia or england found a sound stage and done the entire trilogy using sound stages and cgi he didnt though he filmed the majority of the films on locations in his homeland new zealand and many crews took many months recreating middle earth peter jackson has devoted several years to these films now and deserves the financial rewards that are coming to him a truly enjoyable adventure and one that i look forward to reliving many times this set is one that really exhibits the capablities of the dvd format 
i know i know the american public and the people who make their money from owning movie theatres would find a hour long movie difficult but the extended material really adds to the plot and understanding of the film if youre like me and were already a tolkien fan prior to the movie youll enjoy the additional material as the story is fleshed out if youre like my wife who has never read the trilogy youll quot get quot the plot much more easily all in all this set is the must have for any true fan of the book and the movie highly recommended 
i just saw this movie in the theater and was happily surprised at how good it was considering how many ways a live action version of this story could go wrong director peter jackson and his cast do an excellent job it covers the first book of the trilogy quite well and the visuals special effects are often stunning even at three hours there are plenty of details and subplots that fall by the wayside cate blanchett has very little to do and tom bombadil is missing in action all in all the film is beautiful to watch and you get a very good idea of the main thrust of the tolkien novel i especially enjoyed sir ian mckellan as gandalf and elijah wood as frodo they do a great job in a very tricky roles and they add an emotional core to this film that is missing in far too many fantasy films for once hollywood did not screw it up 
before i review the movie i just wanted to make sure everybody knew that this is a disc set and that a disc set is coming out in november just so you know if you want to buy this and that or just this or that now this movie is one of the best movies ever made i guess it was fitting that it did not win an oscar back in march after all citizen kane also did not win an oscar for best picture by the way raise your hands who knows what movie won in its place do you think years from now well remember a beautiful mind or lord of the rings the movie begins with a minute prologue about the ring of power and its journey from the finger of sauron to bilbos possession from the very start this film breathes life to the story unlike harry potter a superb book turned into a mediocre movie lord of the rings the movie has life of its own all of us who read the book by tolkein know the plotline and while the movie follows it faithfully leaving out only a few sections including the tom bombadil part which i feel was a divergence even in the book and introducing new plot lines the movie moves along with passion and intensity we want to know what will happen to gandalf when he meets saruman we want to know how frodo sees the world when he puts the ring on his finger the movie breathes of vitality there are also many parts of the film that sent chills down my spine such as when the wringwraiths surrounded the tiny hobbits on the ridge or when gandalf and saruman fought each other or the entire scene in the mines of moria the music for the film is superb composed beautifully by howard shore the music invokes peace during the scenes at hobbiton and danger in the mines of moria well done mr shore so in the end i congradulate peter jackson and all involved in making this movie whats more ill be very happy these next two years knowing that the next two are going to be just as good all three were filmed at the same time which means that they will all be the same quality great work mr jackson i cant wait until the two towers 
i love tolkien books but dont judge the films by the books sorry its apples and oranges the best of each crop who says you have to chose not me i have seen this film so many times i could likely apply for guinness book of records hey even my cat loves this film seriously she will sit and watch this and the two tower hypnotised by the film its is not a kids film parents not paying attention this is not harry potter this is a very complicated story with very high ideas that are way over a kids head there is violence quite frightening and you will spend all your time trying to explain it to small ones so no its not a whole family film i think jackson created something everyone needs in this me generation disconnected from the masses computer people people online connect but they also are isolated this film reminds us there are things more important than our immediate wishes like fellowship love and the willingness to sacrifice yourself for the great good of people you care for it is a theme we needed to be reminded and it touches our hearts tolkiens world vividly and beautifully created by director jackson is a place where honour good and evil are not just words but are the forces that shape lives brilliant filmed marvellously acted it has propelled viggo mortensen rightly into the superstar spotlight his talent deserves aragorn is the role of a lifetime and he breathes such life into the character as does wonderful newcomer orlando bloom as legolas the bond between aragorn legolas and gimli are friendships we all would wish to experience ian mckellan christopher lee john rhys davies are as always brilliant but the hobbit bunch is great with wood great as frodo but more surprisingly sean astin son of patty duke and john astin as sam gives the film such heart also the growth of the jokers merry and pippin is deft conceived and acted if you are an ring addict and cannot get enough buy the extended version if you are not a nitpicker who wants all the details then this is a perfect version for you me sigh i have both and figure i will end up buying the complete collectors edition when jackson stuff all three into a single box most of the time when they do these repackages i get ticked begin suckered into buy each incarnation not with this film 
ilove the detail of fantacy it invols you and it is hard not to sit on the edge of your seat i recommend it to all fantacy fans 
okay i admit it im a big old giant size gooberific fanboy geek and once i saw the second of peter jacksons lotr movies i rushed to the nearest computer terminal and bought the deluxe dvd remix version of the first film man am i glad i did this film in all its various manifestations is a fascinating study in how new media have adapted to meet different audiences when i saw the first film in the theatres i thought wow but i still felt some nagging doubts about what i had seen the film was spectacular but felt like it was missing a little bit here and a little bit there well it turnsout that all the things i was looking for were in the film but were skillfully nipped out to make the big screen version a physically endurable event the other longer more nuanced film is one that was made to be seen at ones own pace in the comfort of our hobbit like little homes so there it is the little links in the plot the extra shadings of character the elf y stuff the snug splendor of the shire the extra connective tissue that makes this film move along at a slower more deliberate keel and which makes all nagging doubts vanish like some subtle magical spell both versions make sense the theatrical release felt just about right my attention didnt wander and my bottom didnt hurt when i headed for home then the dvd version felt more satisfying and has all the geely behind the scenes stuff that im still watching now plus it had additional liv tyler footage im in heaven 
this is simply one of the finest most entertaining films since the glory days of quot star wars quot the last film to give me this kind of buzz was quot the matrix quot in after seeing quot the fellowship of the ring quot i came out of the theater so enthralled and giddy that i went home called up three of my closest friends and went out the very same night and saw it a second time i now own it on dvd and i look forward to so many things from the special effects to the glorious score each time i pop it in my player this movie is a visual feast filled with excellent acting and filmmaking expertise it won oscars but eventually lost out to quot a beautiful mind quot for best picture this should have won all academy awards this is a genuine masterpiece 
having just seen a beautiful mind i am in for lack of a better word shock that this production which will be nothing more than a footnote in cinematic history beat lotr for best picture peter jacksons bold and vivid account of tolkiens epic classic has singlehandedly resurrected the fantasy genre an accomplishment more than worthy of oscars highest honor for those who are unfamiliar with tolkiens tale of middle earth there still may be a handful of you out there please note that i will refrain from discussing the details of lotr in this review there are literally hundreds of reviews on this site that summarize the plot of this superb film in minute detail my only advice to the unintiated buy the vhs or dvd then sit back with an open mind and allow tolkiens formidable yet simple story good vs evil sweep you away during a three hour breathtaking cinematic experience the film breathes life into tolkiens beautiful but dangerous middle earth yes some of the tolkien purists may be disappointed that the movie made some artistic adjustments no tom bombadil or glorfindel for example but overall the film stays true to the majestic components of the story and please dont be intimidated by the films length as tolkien himself lamented in his forward to the second edition the book all pages is too short and for the fellowship of the ring the first installment of the lotr trilogy the movie itself in its valiant effort to capture the scope and feel of tolkiens masterpiece is far far too short get this movie enjoy the years true best picture 
this stretches what we thought was possible in film its beautiful and engaging its impressive how jackson was able to film films at once at this quality and save money doing it great actors like c lee i mckellen e wood as frodo is a good choice and so on i usually like endings without a big climax but here it just seemed a little too abrupt the last minutes were the lowest quality im ecstatic about the two towers and a little disappointed about treebeards highly realistic look but thats another issue i dont think this film could possibly be much better buy the soundtrack 
this movie is one of the best examples of modern filmmaking it has all of the elements that a modern classic should have good material a plot driven script larger than life or should it be the opposite in the case of the hobbits characters and fantastic imagery in short epic filmmaking at its finest unlike other genre films lord of the rings transcends cultural barriers it doesnt matter whether youre a tolkien fan or not it doesnt matter whether youve read the books or not although you wouldnt be disappointed if you did you will end up getting involved in the quest to destroy the one ring you will learn to dread the ringwraiths you will want to see aragorn defeat the uruk hai you will feel concerned for gandalf when he battles the balrog tolkien die hards will probably harp about the deletion of certain characters tom bombadil for example and certain scenes and the expansion of arwens role but overall there is no significant alteration from tolkiens work in any case tolkiens style and his penchance for long winded descriptions complex linguistic riddles and genealogies would not have translated well onto celluloid having said that almost everything about the movie is perfect from the choice of new zealand as the setting to the cast selection to the music middle earth couldnt have been brought to life better than peter jackson and company have done i believe tolkien would have been proud to see his creation brought to the screen with such passion 
 ive been seeing a lot of negative reviews for the re release of these three films on dvd a lot of them are from people that dont even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts and want the documentaries on the new ones but dont want to purchase them again now i dont blame them i hate when a dvd is re released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor i however disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they dont want to purchase them again now they have the right to be angry but if you dont own them you should not review them let alone rate them the lowest score in short you already know how great these movies are if you do not already own them all then they make a great buy i purchased all three since i only owned the theatrical cut of the fellowship of the ring i was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again the box art is pretty freaking cool too and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me they dont take a lot of room which is good for me because i have soo many movies that the more space i can save the better the only thing you should know is that although both theatrical and extended cuts are on one disc you still have to switch the disc over in between the movie which is really not a big deal i highly recommend getting these to those that dont own them yet 
visually peter jacksons fellowship of the ring might be the most impressive film ever made within the first ten minutes your jaw has dropped at least four or five times and as the film progresses it never stops delivering the viewer sumptuous imaginary worlds that feel real even tangible unlike the new star wars trilogy jacksons new trilogy seems to understand that audiences dont just need eye candy but a combination of characters plot and effects that work as a whole to bring you somewhere youve never been before and if you have read the books which i have not it still probably cant prepare you for just how fully realized jackson has made tolkiens middle earth it is alternately ethereal menacing and best of all feasible it looks like a real place and it looks like it has been actually lived in this sounds easy but its the failing of many sci fi fantasy films most treat their sets as either museum spaces so pristine youd think the characters were forbidden to cough or as futuristic garbage dumps that couldnt house a rabid dog much less an actual person here middle earth fascinates you and you soon envision yourself in it fotr has been described as a foundation laying first step in the trilogy and in that sense it is a success essentially a three hour chase after a ring that does some very very nasty things it picks up new characters as it goes along and this is where the film has its major flaw while the characters played by cate blanchett sean bean and liv tyler may be readily identified by tolkien readers they remain elusive to the series newcomers those characters and others are barely introduced much less fleshed out so the events involving them can be confusing and at times irrelevant of course that leaves more room for the audience to become better acquainted with elijah woods frodo and ian mckellens gandalf and thats where the movies succeeds the best the audience sees middle earth through frodos eyes and as he travels the landscape he conveys the same sense of wonder and fear that we go through as well it makes the battle for the ring feel important and not just like a plot device all of it feels real and thats the ultimate compliment to any fantasy but theres even more to behold cgi creatures that at last feel real and threatening a villain dark lord sauron who looks like the personification of brute evil a truly astonishing fight sequence between mckellens gandalf and christopher lees saruman the ominous ringwraiths and much more which is best unspoiled dvd owners may want to wait the fall out november promises an extended r rated version of fotr while the film already is much too frightening for children adults might appreciate a few more gory details the extended version will also hopefully flesh out the more marginal characters in the fellowship and the pause button will allow weaker willed viewers multiple bathroom breaks because that would serve to improve what promises to be a film classic for many years to come perhaps surpassing the original star wars trilogy as the ultimate cinematic fantasy 
fellowship of the ring peter jacksons first swing at j r r tolkiens daunting mutli volume masterwork lands flush on the chin of fans and casuals alike its a gorgeous example of just how well a literary adaptation can perform with the right mix of passion budget vision and expertise jacksons direction though quite long winded seems fat free and balanced with a good sense of when to press forward and when to admire its surroundings the acting is a relatively broad mix while ian mckellen resides comfortably in the quasi leading role of gandalf the grey and viggo mortensen is both gallant and inspiring as aragorn i found elijah wood just a bit too doe eyed as the ring bearing hobbit frodo thats nit picking at its finest though admittedly especially given the scene stealing part played by the realm of middle earth itself staggeringly realized with an obsessive attention to detail its a stern flex of the artistic muscle unlike anything ive seen before or after watching the film today in the shadow of the hobbit an unexpected journey is doubly rewarding as dozens of throwbacks to the events of that film are planted like seedlings throughout the landscape for my money this is the best plot of the three lotr volumes to boot with one foot planted firmly on the ground and the other teasing the abyss it covers a gamut of emotions isnt bashful about shedding important cast members and gives its audience a sweeping taste of the many colors and flavors present in this world a wonderful fantasy adventure hybrid spiced with action at all the right moments that does its mythical source material and the legion of associated fans proud 
the beauty of this film is simply staggering as literature the lord of the rings holds a unique spot in history as one of the first works to be considered fantasy though it is truly in the style of previous quot romance quot works lotr is one of the only books that truly delves into the sacred and mythical and comes out of the underworld with dignity and a lesson learned peter jackson and the entire crew of the film version have not hesitated to let themselves be taken away by this truly amazing story and have surrendered to the world that tolkien created while the film is honestly quite bombastic and over the top at times it is quite forgivable the story itself is not lost in the minor changes in adaptation and the film makes up for it in its ability to vividly re create middle earth into a colorful and alive place that i am not even capable of imaginging when i read the book the film also shortens the rambling tendencies of tolkien and focuses instead on the story and the characters bringing to light some parts of the book that may not be so clear this first lord of the rings film does what a film adaptation should do it takes direct inspiration from the book and makes a masterpiece that is true to the original yet stands on its own as a brilliant and transcendently beautiful work of art i cant wait for the next movie to come out 
i think that the fellowship of the ring was just great and was the best movie of this should have won an oscar for best picture actor director and even supporting actor all of the acting was great and everyone was perfect for their role the only problem of this dvd are the theatrical trailers there werent any in the two disc dvd there were theatrical traiers and all of the tv commercials that was great and should have been on the four disc set whats the point of having four discs for one dvd if all the special features the buyer really wants arent there hopefully the four disc extended version for the two towers will have all of the previews and commercials overall i would recommend this dvd to everyone 
i wont lie lord of the rings fellowship of the ring is almost hours long but the detail to the story is well received in each minute almost every detail that is in the book is in the movie its not all jumbled together like a lot of the times when a book becomes a movie everything about lord of the rings is awesome the story the sets and costumes the action scense and of course the visuals a lot of special effects eye candy in this one also the dialogue and acting is very good no one in this one is stiff as a board like some movies all of the actors and actresses become their characters its very cool now again it might bother some people that this is almost hours long i can assure you that it wont be a wasted hours plus there are a lot of extra features on the dvd set that are also pretty cool to watch check out lord of the rings 
okay listen to me do not see this film really do not see this film because if you do youll end up watching the most astounding beautiful superbly acted fantasy adventure film ever the world of middle earth in this film is so vividly portrayed and so gorgeous to watch and experience that youll swear you were in the film and the acting the casting wow everyone is just so good honest and the block busting length of hours for this film will fly by so fast that youll wonder where the time went by the end of the film i was begging for more what that cant be all please just another minutes pleeeease so why shouldnt you see this film because if you love movies as much as i do it will drive you crazy to have to wait another months for the next installment of the lord of the rings i absolutely fell in love with this film and i havent even read any of the books ok well i did read the hobbit about years ago and i usually find fantasy films to be weak remember the dungeon and dragons film a year ago so im just trying to save you from insanity thats all for those who are old enough to remember empire strikes back back in remember the anguish and agony of waiting three years for the next star wars film to find out what happened next well same thing here at least its only one year but those days will take a loooong time perhaps this may even be blasphemous to say but i think the lord of the ring films will in time match if not surpass the star wars movies in popularity frankly this film is better than any of the star wars films and i love those films so i know what im talking about and harry potter hah doesnt even compare and i love the harry potter books too so please spare yourself the misery and dont see this breath taking movie of course you wont listen to me and youll be glad you didnt but youll also be soooo sad another year to wait noooooo 
this is simple if you are even a casual tolkien fan this is nervana if you are a middle earth geek its time to change your underwear if you cant suspend reallity for even minutes dont bother if you like extras this is for you if you didnt read the books liked the movie but did not quite get all of it this will help you understand if you are a busy parent of small children as am i it will get frustrating trying to find time to watch it until am well worth for those who really liked the original i also have the original so that i can actually get to watch it more often this dvd is top quality all around sound picture etc not a concern 
still speechless ive seen the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring four times now the film is cinemagic its scope is epic its delivery is perfect the acting is unforgettable and the story is timeless director peter jackson has created a singular masterpiece that like citizen kane casablanca and star wars will inspire hundreds if not thousands of creative minds to pursue interests in film and writing his adaptation of the book note not a literal translation like the boorish harry potter film almost cries out for academic study of particular note viggo mortenson sp is superb as aragorn stryder of surprising pleasure elijah wood brings a subtle intelligence to the role of frodo baggins the hapless hobbit who inherits the task of bearing the ring to the dark lands of mordor of unyielding praise ian mckellan deserves an oscar for his performance as gandalf 
this movie is in one word spectacular the cast is excellent for those of you who have read the books id say that they did a pretty good job potraying the charachters as in the book especially the hobbits the scenery is beautiful and looks as if its out of this world the soundtrack is catchy and worth purchasing and youll find that you wont be able to take your eyes off the screen even for a bathroom or snack break everyone i know has loved this movie and i for one have seen it twice in the theaters and plan to see it again next sunday no questions asked you have to see this movie you wont be disappointed whether you have read the books or not in fact after you have seen the movie you might even find yourself at the library checking the book out to see what happens next i reccomend that if you liked this movie a lot you can purchase the soundtrack and or official movie guide 
for once im very pleased at what filmmakers have done in translating a book to movie especially one that is beloved by so many people we have a situation here where several things come together in a positive synergy the state of special effects the desire to finally bring it to the screen in the epic proportions it deserves and the money to bring it all together it was also a brilliant move to shoot all three episodes at once so we dont have to endure as long a wait as the star wars endeavors practically everyone who is a huge fan of the books will probably be miffed that some of their favorite parts are missing while understandable these folks should appreciate that just the first installment is just about three hours with two more equal installments coming by the time this thing is done there will be about nine hours of first class filmmaking to enjoy for myself who read it twenty five years ago in college i choose to look at this as a special treat that one should be appreciative of im very impressed that they could tell the basic story as well as they did sure there are a lot of subleties that would make a truly complete filming run over twenty hours but basically its about a shrimpy guy that has to drag a ring accross a magical land and throw it in a pit to create all the different types of creatures good and bad who are involved was a monumental effort most of my past movies reviews here ride high on cynicism in the way they tend to pull cheap shots just to get your dollars this time there is no such cynicism sure its gonna make a lot of money but here is the rare example where the makers of the movie truly seem to love making the story they are telling and wanted to deliver the best possible product possible i congratulate them for doing just that 
while jackson is neither a true artist nor a madman except for the fact he did undergo the tedious process of creating three epics in two years he managed to successfully juggle all that is the recreation of a classic fantasy novel while lacking that certain closure of a stand alone feature and at times being a tad too tedious and slow it successfully crams a great deal of tolkiens work of the first part of the lord of the rings novel the fellowship of the ring for some reason this movie just feels right the cast the props the effects etc they all feel appropriate and very well done on this dvd set you get to see a number of featurettes which include interviews and numerous shots at the amount of armor and weaponry created for this film the detail and work put into all of it is absolutely mind boggling jackson definitely managed to go through a very long and hefty to do list the sets are also all great every room every cave every hillside every pillar every stream its all great as jackson mentioned in one of his interviews he was afraid someone without the expertise in special effects would take a project like this sure having started his film career with his home brewn bad taste having worked on all of its effects and all of its directing for four years on occassional weekends and days off he sure has the patience and experience to tackle a project of this caliber and deliver marvelous effects without ever over doing anything except for galadriels power hungry dark side scene which was awful kudos to jackson for a great movie and kudos for the excellent dvd package which is all but lacking in features 
surely if tolkien were alive today he would have argued against the making of this film fearing that something would be lost in the translation but tolkien is dead the films have been made and the verdict is out the fellowship of the ring is a great movie this is what fantasy fans have been waiting for a good storyline believable characters wonderful scenery and god grand battle scenes for the uninitiated in fantasy there is no need to fear as the beginning of the movie does give a brief but accurate synopsis as to what has gone on before and how the ring came to be approximately three hours in length the movie is admittedly long but one has to be able to appreciate how peter jackson was able to tell a page story in that amount of time and tell it well at that the movie does have its slow parts but this is not so much jacksons fault as it was tolkiens i personally found the book the fellowship of the ring to be a little slow and boring in fact if i rated the book right now id probably give it only to stars out of if there are any slow or boring parts in this movie its because jackson was trying to stick as true to tolkiens vision as reasonably possible if you look on the internet youll see lots of artwork that is very similar to the movie for example doesnt the cover art on the paperback version of the lays of beleriand look like the inspiration for saurons costume at the beginning of the movie quot to translate is to betray quot the italian proverb goes but with this movie peter jackson has joined the ranks of the few that have proved that proverb wrong 
i was hesitant to buy this since we already have the movies and weve watched them a dozen times the only reason i went ahead was because supposedly they integrated the changes into the movie we all know they could do this since the beginning of dvds but for some unknown reason they never have they always put extra scenes or alternate scenes somewhere else and you had to watch them separate from watching the movie even the bourne film you had to click an icon to make it show the alternate beginning and the alternate ending they actually redid parts of the movie as well as just adding back in stuff that got cut and even changed little parts including changing the music to match the result is a movie that makes a lot more sense there are more details that really put things into perspective there is a scene with boromir that changed my entire view of him really gave him more substance as a character its very difficult to tell you why you absolutely must see the movie like this without giving things away you will have to have some faith when i tell you it was worth every dime the extra pieces give a much better sense of time also these are things that felt odd in the first movie but then it was another scene and you pretty much forgot about it when you see the changes it feels right it feels like this was the way it should always have been i cant wait to get the other two in the special edition versions as an aside the movie is lighter also seems like theyve increased the contrast though ive never been good at that color stuff so im not sure what exactly they did but you see things you couldnt see before because it was simply too dark 
this points review is my small contribution to the unprecedented joint effort of amazon reviewers in such a relatively short time to express and describe their impressions thoughts and feelings about this extraordinary experience you dont have to read the book to enjoy the film this is the real thing as a fellow who hasnt read both books harry potter hp and lord of the rings lotr but has seen both movies lotr overshadows hp completely the originality of this film shines through the inevitable comparison of the two im sorry i wasted my time on seeing hp dont waste yours visually stunning you shall witness never seen before visual effects that will leave you breathless the movie is beyond everything else a visual experience after all the leading stars of lotr are the special effects that could be accomplished only in recent years thanks to advanced computer technologies audibly striking in addition to the visual dimension the music noises and voices bring the film to heights of performance few movies share it is not suitable for kids under the age of the movie is chilling creepy terrifying and contains some images that are not easily digested there were several scenes in which i was so tensed frightened and edgy i actually jumped in my seat and throughout the whole experience my body was stiffed as a rule there are a lot of horror movie motives in lotr and i wouldnt recommend any weak hearted or pregnant women to experience them beware of course beautiful landscape shots that make you wish youve been to new zealand the sooner the better this country looks like heaven in contradiction to other reviewers i am not sorry i will have to wait a year for the next movie i think the producers have made a wise decision in holding the crowds anticipating for the next to come waiting is sometimes a good thing especially when one knows how good it is going to be 
i got the whole trilogy on blu ray and it was totally worth it i love these movies and if youre a fan go for it 
a phenomenal story that will engage the imagination into belief hours later the story and images are still turning over and over in my mind the quest is so compelling and destined it is impossible to let go i may have to run out to a theater an watch the twin towers this evening other reviewers have likened it to the star wars epics and i agree along with the caveat that this has far more moral thread and emotional resonance add to this a wonderous sense of mystery dread true magic and transformation and there is the stuff of myth is these short hours of movie this dvd edition is worth it just the other day i was debating the merits of the extras found on most dvds with a friend his argument which is true sometimes is that the extra scenes and bits end up on the cutting room floor for a reason if the piece of art cant stand up on its own then thats a problem in the first place the edition has scenes that enrich the story fills in a few gaps and adds to the richness of the thing after watching youre either going to watch the whole thing again or dive into the commentary its not like you really have a choice 
it is really truly sad when hollywood double and triple dips with their multitude of movie releases first comes the theatrical version then the special edition then after everyone has spent all of their money out comes the special extended edition the way the film was supposed to be before it was tragically chopped to satisfy corporate suits and an attention deficit american crowd in most cases the scenes cut from films are of no consequence and in essence really dont do much for the over all picture and feel but in the case of the fellowship of the ring the extra and extended scenes really flesh out the main characters and make the film that much more enjoyable especially if you are a fan of the film and the book though still not an exact representation of the book the fellowship of the ring extended edition is an amazing masterpiece a true landmark in film making there is over minutes of extra and extended material all seamlessly integrated into the picture no tom bombadil is still mia and a couple of other things are still absent but certain characters and situations are largely fleshed out and make much more sense where as in the theatrical version things were made short and chopped the extended edition feels like a finished product and it is very satisfying to see the new material a great portion of the songs from the book are present though i assume they were originally cleaved out to appease more to the general public who may or may not enjoy song in their action drama fantasy film they do very well to complete the atmosphere and mythology of tolkiens world the extra material pushes the film well over hours and spans across two discs of course no special edition would be complete without bucket loads of special features and this edition delivers in spades count them discs of special features come with this wonderful edition chock full of behind the scenes shorts making of featurettes commentary and a whole host of stuff that will surely please the die hard fan all of this comes in a really cool box that resembles a leather bound book director peter jacksons gift of his extended version of the fellowship of the ring is a true treat and easily makes the theatrical cut obsolete i cannot stress enough how truly complete this film feels with the extra material while i do not agree with or different versions of a film i do feel that this version of the fellowship of the ring is well worth a double or triple dip now if we can only get the fellowship of the ring extended edition on blu ray 
i thouroughly enjoyed the extended edition of the fellowship of the ring the extended edition of the film includes about a half hour of extended or new scenes that are straight from the original text of tolkien the appendices cover the movie from its inception to its interpretation from text to screen to its intitial premier it includes nearly hours of details on all the intricacies of the fellowships filming it is excellent but this version of the film is only for those who enjoy extras as much as the film itself 
i have no problem at all comparing the fellowship of the ring to the original star wars i feel that the lord of the rings films are and will be the star wars for this generation even though george lucas is producing his second star wars trilogy right now those films absolutely pale in comparison to lord of the rings comparing fellowship of the ring to the phantom menace is like comparing a space odyssey to independence day the difference in quality is that huge fellowship of the ring is a triumph of film making and storytelling in every respect it is simply a perfect movie every detail from the script to the actors to the effects and production design to music and photography everything in this film is absolutely top of the line fellowship of the ring is a far far better movie than a beautiful mind and was far more deserving of the best picture oscar was a year that was filled with great films though such as mulholland drive the royal tenenbaums and memento but fellowship was undoubtedly the most important and highest quality cinematic achievement of this disc extended edition dvd is a must own for fans of the films or the books how do you improve on a movie that was already a top of the line five star classic well the extended edition does just that thirty minutes of scenes are added fleshing out the story and presenting more of the detail that is prevalent in j r r tolkiens books my favorite addition is the new opening scene featuring bilbo writing his book and talking about the meager lives of hobbits with these new scenes fellowship is pushed to a three and a half hour running time however watching this movie is no chore at all it is engrossing from the first minute to the last everything presentation wise is perfect the picture and sound are excellent this dvd has probably the most beautiful picture ive seen including attack of the clones the real treat however are the extra features two whole discs worth i have not made it through all of the extra material yet but what ive seen is very enlightening and entertaining the behind the scenes footage and interviews are very informative best of all are the four feature length commentaries by cast and crew members ive only so far listened to the cast commentary but it is a joy to hear this splendid presentation could not have happened to a better film the production of lord of the rings is one of the biggest most complex and most important film shoots in movie history and deserves to be documented as such i hope that the two towers and return of the king will recieve dvd editions as magnificent as this one fellowship of the ring extended edition gets my vote for best dvd release ever 
this is easily the best movie ive seen in years the scenery is a visual delight and the characters are well acted too ian mckellen is best suppoering actor nominated as gandalf while he is certainly good i think its the dimunitive hobbits that steal the show i read the book years ago in all the details i can remember this movie is an accurate retelling it should make tolkien fans out of some who havent been before though i wouldnt call it a substitute for the books themselves but it is a must see for those who are fans already and it can be considered a wonderful supplement to the original often i find movies based on books ive read to be visually disappointing but this made middle earth even more visually stunning than i had previously imagined im sure many of us will be eagerly awaiting the sequels 
prior to this film director peter jackson was obscure even among the anonymous wannabes of the film industry his resume consisted of a half a dozen indy films in the horror and comedy genres if you took the budgets of all his prior films together they wouldnt equal his salary for this franchise he now owns the second highest grossing film in history talk about a cinderella story this film was somewhat of a personal obsession for jackson it took eight years from inception to completion he originally pitched the idea to miramax who agreed to take it on and then balked at the cost of a two movie deal and backed out desperate to save the project he presented it to new line cinema and convinced them that if he filmed in new zealand used his own effects company and filmed all three movies back to back he could make three films for less than the cost of two they bought the project and gave him a record million budget for the three he completed the filming for all three films in months of continual shooting a record jacksons task was daunting he wanted to create a film with mass appeal that was true to the classic books considering the devoted following of tolkiens trilogy their preoccupation with the smallest trivia and the sheer volume of the works this was an almost impossible task jackson decided to lean toward the action adventure elements while paying homage to aficionados with scenes that compressed the intricacies of the various cultures and contained allusions to various pieces of trivia that only devotees of the books would understand the result is a terrific film that doesnt leave the books out of the screenplay the transformation of the real world into the fantasy world is nothing short of fantastic the combination of makeup set decoration costumes new zealand locations and special effects sets a new standard for this or any genre the attention to detail is astounding from the elf ears to the hobbit toes the ensemble cast does a fine job without any need for a superstar elijah wood is lovable and believable as the dauntless frodo wood has the perfect combination of childlike exuberance and steely resolve to play the ring bearer ian mcclellan who is a big ring fan himself is perfectly cast as gandalf with almost years in tv and films mckellen is one of the veterans of the cast he is a powerful dramatic actor and he renders gandalf with great range he is formidable and commanding in some scenes and tender and paternal in the scenes with frodo along with christopher lee years in film the battle of the elders is given enormous dramatic power viggo mortensen is awesome as aragon mortensen demanded to do all his own stunts and trained exhaustively at swordsmanship and other combat skills to make his fight scenes as realistic as possible in one scene he had a tooth knocked out and after a quick trip to the dentist he was back on the set later that day ian holm is wonderful as bilbo baggins holm captures the ageless hobbit with a youthful enthusiasm that belies his advanced age this film is really more the first episode of a miniseries than a film that stands alone by the end it is clear that we havent yet reached the middle even if you never read the books still at three hours it never drags it is a tremendous filmmaking achievement that redefines the fantasy genre and sets production standards that will be difficult to equal it is fabulously entertaining for audiences of all ages one cannot see this film and not be eager for the next episode to be released i rated it a it is motion picture history in the making 
its interesting to see how many people say things like quot get the extended version because it has more scenes in it quot or quot get the extended version because it has more extras in it quot well sometimes longer is better and sometimes not in the case of quot the two towers quot i would agree that the extended version was easily superior to its theatrical counterpart the extended version filled in many important plot elements and fully rounded out the middle movie most of the dangling plot elements were far better explained in this extended version however i cannot say the same for the extended version of the first movie i e the fellowship of the ring the extended version of the fellowship added very little new to the plot development with the exception of the lady galadriels gift giving scenes on the contrary the extra footage of the shire in the beginning weakened the much tighter and far better shire opening in the theatrical version plus with the various changes to the musical score the extended version of the fellowship of the ring just drags on too much i cannot recommend the extended version of fellowship over the theatrical version all in all my view on theatrical versus extended is summarized as follows the fellowship of the ring the fellowship of the ring theatrical version stars a very tight and well plotted opening for the trilogy the fellowship of the ring extended version stars moves far slower at the wrong times strong scenes from the theater version end up feeling weaker and watered down the musical score is weaker as well the two towers the two towers theatrical version stars rather disappointing due to too many unfinished scenes and the feeling that too many plot twists were left unexplained the two towers extended version stars fully fixes all of the elements missing from the theatrical version this one should have been released as the theatrical version the return of the king the return of the king theatrical version stars fully realized beautiful ending to the trilogy in spite of the lack of the scouring of the shire hey do you want to sit for another hour the return of the king extended version not yet released if it goes on too long ill have to build a bladder bag into the couch but its doable still there are a few loose ends which it may well address chiefly the house of healing etc once again though even an extra half hour is probably going to be too long but well see anyway thats my take on extended versus theatrical so far it really depends on each and every movie sometimes longer is better sometimes not 
great i now have the complete series and look forward to more of the same and cant wait to get them 
this is one part of what must be the most amazing cinematic work of all times it helped gain a whole new generation of tolkein followers 
certainly not but peter jacksons quot fellowship of the ring quot adaptation of j r r tolkiens the lord of the rings is a quot classic quot and not only in the fantasy genre peter jackson creator of such cult classics like quot brain dead quot quot bad taste quot quot meet the feebles quot and the fantastic quot heavenly creatures quot brought to life tolkiens fotr with the help of talented artists such as andrew lesnie cinematographer of quot babe quot quot doing time for patsy cline quot quot lotr the towers quot quot lotr return of the king quot etc not since the quot city of the lost children germinal dracula lost highway and schlafes bruder brother of sleep as there been such beautiful images composer howard shore the quot panic room quot quot ed wood quot quot naked lunch quot quot silence of the lambs quot quot the game quot quot esther kahn quot quot se en quot etc visual effects supervisor jim rygiel starship troopers last of mohicans multiplicity etc costume designer nglia dickson crush xena heavenly creatures the towers rotk and many more the result is simply outstanding visualy speaking weta is now equal if not better than some of the most reputated special fx company working today the opening introduction of the fotr of the quot last alliance quot gollums eyes the hobbits orcs the eye of sauron the bridge of khazad dum etc etc are perfect examples no more cartoony and non believable characters this film takes a step further the only average looking cg creations are quot the cave troll quot the quot balrog quot and quot galadiels transformation quot and to top it all this film also has quot emotion quot sadness nostalgia and great acting performances from ian mckellen who portrays gandalf elijah wood frodo ian holm bilbo baggins viggo mortensen aragorn sean astin samwise liv tayler arwen cate blanchett galadiel hugo weaving elrond orlando bloom billy boyd john rhys davies and sean bean boromir one of my personal favorite characters the adaptation while i dont think tolkien wouldve been proud well maybe he never wanted a film adaptation of his books anyway peter jackson has done a miracle of course purists will always complain about some characters and small details missing such as tom bombadil and the pace of some scenes are too fast but you have to keep in mind that the hour version of the fellowship of the ring is in fact much longer and more violent than the one shown in theaters p js r rated version of the fotr will only be available on dvd suggestions read j r r tolkiens the silmarillion quot fellowship of the ring quot the two towers return of the king the hobbit be sure not to miss the norse mythology also the quot ring of nibelung quot from richard wagner and quot thorgal quot from jean van hamme and try not to miss peter jacksons fake documentary quot forgotten silver quot 
i have read the lord of the rings but that was back when i was a teenager many moons ago so much of the long and complex story has long since evaporated from my consciousness from this vantage point i simply do not care how closely peter jacksons adaptation hews to its source material all i know is that the fellowship of the ring is obviously a landmark film perhaps the best large scale fantasy movie since fritz langs siegfried based on a germanic myth that tolkien also drew on for lotr incidentally fellowship was clearly a labor of love for everyone involved in its making and it shows in everything from the art direction and set design to the cinematography writing acting and especially jacksons impassioned directing its surprising to read that jackson says he prefers the theatrical cut because the extended dvd is clearly superior fleshing out several small points and adding several wonderful scenes that while not strictly necessary to the narrative add texture and feeling to the film as a whole very definitely the choice to make over the original version dvd 
combine a great story a huge budget and highly creative imagination and you get the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring this is an incredible movie the story is too complex to paraphrase but lets just say this by the time the third installment hits the theatres there will be pandemonium in the streets with everyone fighting to get into the theaters the story grabs ahold of you at the beginning and never lets go a truly epic film buy this movie its awesome 
unfortunately i have not read the lotr books i have read the hobbit however so had some vague idea about all this before the film and then i went to see it words also unfortunately simply fail me when it comes to describing it the film is faultless the cast are perfect headed by elijah wood as worried hobbit frodo and ian mckellen as wise wizard gandalf the storys praises dont need to be sung thanks to the legendary books that based it the music is rousing and passionate the ending is on just the right note to enfuriate you at having to leave and ensure that youll return for more and even at almost three hours i still wanted to sit and be told more peter jacksons direction is enchanting in one of the most picturesque epics of all time and it is an epic the finished trilogy will make the badly cast star wars prequels look like b movies yet it has so much more than visuals to offer everything comes together it pulses with atmosphere particular in the tunnel scenes when the orcs attack its nail biting stuff there isnt a moment of the movie that seems wasted it feels like so much more than a simple movie so much so that you simply dont want to stop watching when its over no doubt two towers will have just as well timed an ending the question remains will this dauntingly perfect masterpiece topple the matrix im not doubting it because although thats brilliant its basing most on looks and lotr could survive on cast and script alone its pointless even trying to descibe the film just please watch it it is the finest movie ive ever seen it is beyond perfect it is beyond critisism see it and be astounded 
when i saw the lord of the rings in the theater i was dutifully impressed with the production quality and the adaption of what must truly be deemed a masterpiece of the twentieth century i went into the extended version hoping that it would extend the vision and i was not disappointed from the beginning the movie offers a much better explanation of hobbits starting out with bilbo writing about his adventures there and back again a hobbits tale the only shortcoming is the introduction via knocks of the sackville baggins does little beyond explaining why bilbo was annoyed when gandalf shows up while this is not critical information to understand the stroy it better sets up the ordinary life of frodo prior to taking on his perilous journey as the adventure moves on we see a much more plausible enactment of events in bree an extended look at the wilderlands leading up to weathertop and greater character development of aragorn strider who will become pivotal in future movies the scenes in rivendell do greater justice to the setup of the fellowship which greatly adds to the epic and the moria scenes are extended to give a much greater sense of the person of gandalf and his sense of justice when it comes to gollum of all the pieces added none was more necessary to the epic at large than the wonder of gimli over galadriel the gifting of the fellowship while not important for this movie should play a much greater role as the epic rolls on this december as for the extra material for a true tolkien fan you really have to purchase both the extended version and the original release as the material presented is different in each version one of the nices pieces in this set is the notes on the locations that became different places in middle earth while not technically superior it is nice watching jackson and crew scout out the locations that make new zealand middle earth as you peruse the dvd set make sure to check out the easter egg included in the set if you deride the set for not presenting a trailer of the next volume in this epic you would do well to explore a bit before passing final judgement 
i read the complete works of j r r tolkein so many times i lost count each time i pictured in my minds eye a very similar version of what peter jackson has put on film i love the way he for the most part didnt re write the story in order to make the movie close to the detail that tolkein placed in his writings 
the extended version is a must for all sf f fans as well as those who love epic adventure not only is the story enthralling but the filmwork is probably the best that current technology can produce how do they films scenes where gimli the tallest actor in the lot is dwarfed by legolas and aragorn the cgi is pervasive but so seamlessly woven into the scenes that i challenge anyone to list all of the cgi scenes the extra scenes are vivid with details and go a long way in adding depth both to the storyline and to the characters a must for any self respecting film fan 
i am and i went and saw this on my birthday have already read the books times i was naturally looking forward to seeing this movie the movie had some very dark and creepy sections but i liked it very much i have a few complaints to remark about sarumans tower orthanc was supposed to be white i didnt think lothlorien was so dark a place the books describe it as being light the extention of the battle with the cave troll which i thought was unneeded however i had no problems with the extention of arwens part or the exclusion of tom bombadil i was thoroughly impressed with rivendell isengard especially with all the zoom ins through the forges and canyons the shire moria and the short scenes in mordor the sepcial effects were magnificent such as the spectacular fireworks at the beginning and at some times terrifying the hideous balrog the shrieking orcs and he ominous black riders the violence while being there was done tastefully and even rhe beheading of the orc was quick my favorite actor was wood as frodo and mckellen did a good job as gandalf as well sean bean made an excellent boromir and christopher lee looked just as i imagined saruman i give the movie stars and if you enjoy fantasy go see this but leave your younger kids at home i intend to buy the video when it comes out and to see the next two way to go jackson 
the american film institute afi was accurate while the academy was wrong this year the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring was easily the best film of that said we turn to reasons why it was so first of all it should be said that the film was amazingly true to its source material unlike one other major film which was pure fantasy disguised as biography and that was no easy matter the attention to detail was stunning especially when one went back to the books to review those details certain dramatic license was taken to accentuate this chapter and set up the next but littel was done that was not in the books somewhere it was also beautifully produced the academy at least recognized that new zealands chamber of commerce was handed a free ad campaign here it was a literate tale of course it had to be given its source how wonderful to be able to commend a film that may encourage americans to read and one that emphasizes literate speech across the board the film was very well acted with several performances that warranted recognition overall an epic version of an epic tale and time will show that this entry along with the other two that will be seen over the next two years will be considered film classics there is a school of thought that holds that the lord of the ring was the best novel of the last century and a solid case can be made for that claim in time a similar claim may be made for this master film version of tolkeins epic work bravo bravo bravo bravo bravo 
this fantastical film was nominated for a best picture oscar so it seems even the uptight academy members couldnt avoid giving it some nod of praise besides just the usual good cinematography and best score banalities but they werent brave enough to actually award it the prize though it certainly would have deserved it tolkiens literary work is without a doubt a sprawling masterpiece but anyone who has read the work and seen peter jacksons epic film knows the two are quite capable of standing independent of one another you dont need to read the book to know the movie is good and vice versa and that is how one should consider the film a piece onto itself yes jackson has managed to keep the spirit and integrity of the story which stays amazingly true to the book but it is not a direct translation the book sets a lazy pace and spends much time celebrating middle earths inhabitants with songs and legend the quest is the backdrop placed for us to enjoy the characters the film however is all about evil vs good and the bloody fight to preserve it jackson has managed to inscribe a new passion and adventure for our senses in a way that only a great visual storyteller could and in a way only a movie could lord of the rings far surpasses any movie released in and it is unfortunate that many equate commercial success with substandard movies or believe a movie needs to be drama based to be worthy of serious consideration the fact is the translation from literature to a credible intelligent film without losing any of the original substance is in itself remarkable add onto that the years of pre production impeccable casting filming post productions this movie deserved to win best picture for its unyielding dedication to detail and devotion to making it a reality the fact that it is a genre specific film is probably the only reason it has been denied its right to stand by the greats to make a movie that grand in scale without disintergrating the project into hollywood mush to create an entire world translated from imagination to an interesting visual reality to allow the characters to shine despite the intimidating scale of the backdrop and story is a testament to jacksons skill and direction this is a movie that connects with its audience and creates escape this is true storytelling that goes beyond clever camera tricks and overdramatic actors this is one of the best films ever made this is the type of storytelling magic that films were made for in the grand tradition of the original star wars triology and et and the matrix afi needs to revise their top list 
as a long time tolkien fan and a person who has read the trilogy three times i must say i was absolutely astounded and captivated by the new tolkien movie quot the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring quot i am very proud of the producers directors actors et al it seemed as if everyone had read the trilogy and understood their parts not just memorized lines form a script the scenes were amazing hobbiton has been brought to life in a way i really did not believe could be accomplished on film the shire lives and breathes and will inspire thousands of people to read tolkiens works this film series brings the world of tolkien to the big screen and into peoples homes like never before this is wonderful i had to sneak the books home and hide them under the bed amp pretend to be reading something else so my mom wouldnt catch me now teenagers can just sneak out for a night of magick and adventure i was a bit disappointed with the portrayal of the male elves they seemed to be a bit too quot human quot and less ethereal and wise than they are portrayed in the books however over all i believe this movie portrays the characters in the trilogy better than most people can imagine luckily the film is more fast paced than the trilogy and most of the important scenes are retained however i still believe reading the trilogy is crucial to understanding the film and who wants to wait an entire year for the next chapter so to speak this film will bring a whole new generation to the world of tolkien and hopefully a new generation of book lovers i am so impressed with this film that i have nothing negative to say whatsoever and this coming from someone whos wife quoted tolkien on our wedding invitations 
if i were to write a couple of words describing peter jacksons portrayal of j r r epic novel it would be that the movie is quot glorious spectacular innovative and on the edge of your seat excitement quot the camera directing special effects and engrossing cinematography of lord of rings is beyond words the film had been in development for over yrs so jackson carefully and effortlessly put his best effort for the film the basic premise of lord of rings centers on a hobbit named frodo baggins elijah wood who has the task of destroying the rings that has caused destruction across middle earth and the dangerous and fascinating journey he and his companions gandalf the grey ian mckellen strider aragorn viggo mortensen legolas greenleaf orlando bloom and others undertake to destroy the ring peter jacksons film of tolkiens j r r novel starts of by telling us of the numerous rings across middle earth that are held by dwarves elves and other creatures however there is one ring though that no one knows about that is in the hands of lord sauron an evil beast that will bring destruction to middle earth sauron organizes an unholy army composed of demons however he is met by the army of king thoden and prince isildurs harry sinclair ii army everyone is nearly wiped but in spectacular fashion isildur chops sauron evil claw thus removing the ring from him however one of the messages of the lord of rings is that the ring corrupts everyone who wears it the ring is a symbol of power greed and evil thus prince isildur comes under the rings evil power until the rings kills him and falls unto another unfortunate soul the next person to get the ring is gollum a hideous ugly thing after gollum the rings falls to bilbo baggins ian holm from the movie quot the fifth element quot a hobbit baggins is celebrating his plus birthday however during the celebrating gandalf discovers bilbo is hiding the ring and orders him to hand it over before this happens we are treated to truly magical effects during the celebration during one scene gandalf mckellan is smoking a pipe however the smoke turns into a really cool ship floating in air wow jacksons is already starting his special effects in grand fashion gandalf then gives the ring to frodo baggins wood frodo is not your typical hero however his pure heart and bravery will be shown during the course of his journey which is another of tolkeins message it doesnt matter how you look in the outside its the inside that counts and frodo has a heart and character bigger than life that echoes bravery intelligence and strength its no wonder audiences seem to love the hobbits they are small in size yes but big on heart as the old cliche goes quot its not the size of the man but the size of fight in the man quot frodo and his hobbit friends samwise sam gamgee sean astin then leave the village of the shire in hopes of finding help of destroying the ring aragon mortenson is the strider ranger who saves frodo and his friends from when he is pursued from ring raiders at a local inn a great line by aragon to frodo is quot are you frightened quot frodo responds quot yes quot then aragon responds quot not nearly frightened enough quot all the actors in the movie elijah woods ian mckellan gods and monsters xmen liv tyler who plays arwen the elf all give their best performances in fact no matter what good or bad movies these actors have done this movie will be the best movie they have ever been in frodo aragon and sam go to reiverdale house of elrod where the elves are and meet arwen und oacute miel the lovely liv tyler who has magical powers in one scene as she as taking frodo on her horse to safety a group of demonic ring raiders come after as they approach a river arwen says quot if you want him come claim him quot as the raiders come close using her powers arwen unleashes a tidal wave upon the unlucky foes its really a great combination of special effects and good scripting and directing jackson delivers one memorable image after another using the tolkein novel the elves of elrod decide on having a council meeting to address what to do about the ring at first everyone has difference of opinions as to who should keep then it is revealed that ring can only be destroyed at the mountain of doom however no one including the elves dwarves or strider volunteer to go to morod to destroy it then frodo whose heart and courage surpasses his height volunteers to go to the mountain inspired by frodo aragon sam gamgee gimli the dwarf john rhys davies legolas and rest of frodos hobbit friends decide to join frodo and thus the fellowship of the ring is formed this is not the first movie that has been put on the screen by followers of jrr tolkien however it is by the far the best quot the hobbit quot one of tolkein other works was made into animated film in the s by jules bass and arthur rankin jr two geniuses who are legends in animated cartoons for kids of all ages unfortunately quot the hobbit quot was geared for kids and so much of the intensity and story of the animated film was cut off from the film along with characters from the novel the effects for lord of rings were done by weta ltd the new zealand effects company jackson founded yrs ago the investment paid of jackson of course made the remaining sequels to lord of rings the lord of rings the two towers and the lord of rings the return of king and they were both as excellent as the first one althought i personally think the first has an edge that the other two seem to lack as the movie nears its end 
finally someone has realized j r r tolkiens masterpiece of literature on film it took decades and as many tries not only did they get the look and feel correct but the writing is near perfect all the right decisions were made what lines of dialogue to include what to compress for visual times sake etc and they remained true to tolkien which is wise since the more one strays from genius the worse off the end result especially noteworthy is that classic moment between gandalf and frodo in the mines of moria where frodo confides in gandalf his wish that none of this had happened and gandalf in him wisdom encourages frodo that he was meant to find the ring that his present sufferings are not in vain and are not going unnoticed but are serving a greater plan peter jackson the lotrs producers and ian mckellan who plays gandalf had better win an oscar by the time of the third installment of this series not to exclude the other cast members of this most worthy cast either elijah wood and his three hobbit comrads namely sean astin were born to play their respective parts indeed it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing any of the characters who else could convey saruman the whites sinister darkness with such believable and motivated evil as does christopher lee five minutes into fellowship i knew they had nailed this one it was that apparent the care and love and money that this baby required was all there pouring from the screen into my dazzled and misty eyes 
i simply couldnt wait for the four dvd version so i got this to tide me over and i do not regret it honestly i left the theatre thinking the movie was fine not great but fine having watched this dvd three times through now and twice through all of the extra material i appreciate it much more there are changes from the book which i just reread but there is very little to complain about it seems to me yes there is some bowing to the pressure of the modern audience more romance more prominence to the female characters but it is no more than you can expect given the realities of justifying hundreds of millions of dollars to produce these films its getting near the time when the four dvd set will be out and if youre going to buy that then just bite the bullet and wait otherwise pick up this version there is plenty to keep you content until the two towers hits theatres and well still be watching these films decades from now 
this movie has to be one of my top favorites it is positively a beautiful film the classic characters are brought to life through incredible performances from the cast and somehow peter jackson managed to capture the charm of the novels on film no matter how many times ive seen it or read it i still find myself in tears with the closing scenes the costuming is glorious and the scenery is completely believable the sets are middle earth and you are utterly lost in this story through the dramatic wonderful way it is told the dvd is great the sound is better than i could have hoped for and the picture is better than i had expected a wonderful carry over from the theater the special features are also a blast the minute preview of the two towers is great leaving you on the edge of your seat to see the next film which regretfully we have to wait for december to see a slight insight into gollum is given at least how he is created in the movie and even more great clips are waiting of course the trailers are great as is everything else on the dvd it would be an absolute crime against humanity to purchase the full screen version of this considering even in the widescreen it is hard to take in everything in any given shot go with the widescreen the full screen is so chopped it has a clostrophobic feeling to it and of course the vhs cant have as sharp of picture as the dvd and believe me the picture is great on this im looking forward to the extended version due out in november but this is a marvelous movie and a delightful dvd pick it up and allow yourself to be swept away into middle earth remember its a dangerous business frodo going out your front door 
this was the best film that i saw at the theatre last year peter jackson directed this film perfectly using the right cast and locations and sticking to the actual story the action scenes in this film are some the best that ive seen well worth your money 
i watched my first lotr special edition fellowship for the first time last night and i have to say it is way better than the theatrical more footage gandalf speaking in the black tongue which was in the book the only thing thats missing from the extended version is tom bombadil i was hoping bombadil would be in this but other than that more than perfect id give it infitive stars if i could this is a great extended version sometime soon ill buy the extended two towers and they show us which they didnt in the original that mithril comes from moria interesting footage of isildur putting on the ring and in the river it slips off his hand go extended it would be nice if they even only released the extended theyre so good if i write anymore ill exceed my thousand word limit farewell 
all of the extra footage is greatly enlightening and really opens up the actors to you it is very interesting how you are able to get such a good idea of who they really are after hearing them all speak about it and see all of the friendships that they formed and the great experiences they had i was a little envious that i couldnt have been in the movie the extra footage also reveals all of the enormous amount of work that went in to this fantasic film of epic proportions the movie is just as amazing as it was in the theatre and the extra scenes are fantastic some of the scenes i cant understand how they were able to take out because they set up parts of the following movies i was a little disappointed that there was no tom bombadil but after seeing all the work that was put into the making of this film i am just appreecaitive that they made it at all it is absalutely brilliant and a deffinite must for any lord of the rings fan if there was anything higher than stars i would give it to this film it is two thumbs way up high 
i have about dvds but i would sell the great majority of them to have this movie on dvd it is without a doubt a great film and i cant wait to see the extended version my birthday is this month and for months ive been telling my wife that this is the only gift i want the two towers this december 
yes i am one of those i have my head buried in the ground i read the hobbit but did not continue on with the box set i own so heres my hand slap it i have learned my lesson well countless fans of the series have shamed me for not reading the books holly do you have any idea what you are missing out on the series of a century so here i hide i went and borrowed a vhs tape of the movie and after watching minutes of the fellowship of the ring i drove staight up the rode from my house and purchased it on dvd its that good the movie reminds me of many favorites i have seen over the years the neverending story legend or even the dark crystal i am entranced i am still recovering from from jaw pain as my mouth hung open while i watched the dvd three times in a row i coudnt get enough of rivendale the shire or the orcs and goblins so now i am part of the in crowd i plan on reading the entire series the minute i finish writing this review dont expect a new review anytime soon 
everything to be said for these films has already been said so let me say this the biggest issue people have with these movies is p j cut out too much simplified characters didnt allow characters to develop etc yes im sad that faramir was crooked and tom bombadil didnt make it and gimli tried to be funny and failed lets say someone tried to make a accurate version of lotr do you know how long it would be long i would love that but the longer it is the more expensive it grows pj had a limit of hours was as long as he could go when you have to cram a page book into hours things have to get cut simplified changed for clarity if every minor character had been left in non fans would have been hopelessly confused and bored when youre trying to please the fans the non fans the box office and new line cinema its a pretty tough juggling act with everyone pj had to please he did a pretty good job before you decide he did everything wrong keep in mind that nothing is perfect and we cant always have exactly what we want if we think we can were being jusssst like ssssomeone we all knowsss arent we 
intro first of all i would like to point out that this dvd is spectacular the widescreen that is and a movie of this calibur deserves it second i would like to point out the length of the movie yes everyone knows its about hours long and if you dont then now you do and most will be a little bored if youre not familiar with this movie or j r r tolkiens works the book was long so the movie is too if you are a total action nut then maybe this isnt the movie for you you have to understand the beauty as well and at least have matured your movie expectations beyond fast and the furious and matrix plot the plot of the movie is well unique if you are familiar with the prequel to this movie book the hobbit then you are at least somewhat aware who gandalf and bilbo are and why they have such a long lasting friendship also youll be familiar with the magic ring bilbo discovered when he was younger if you watch the hobbit but anyways the plot of this movie switches the view from bilbo to frodo his grandson this movie fellowship of the ring is the first in the trilogy of the lord of the rings and dont expect everything to be wrapped up in just this volume although a lot will be explained without ruining too much this movie is about discovering the true purpose of the magic ring that bilbo discovered o so long ago i would rate the plot top notch for fantasy and extrememly well put for any other plot line the scenery in this movie is to be noted it was filmed mainly in new zealand by peter jackson so there is a lot of beautiful mountain ranges and such to be seen youll hardly believe its just on one area of the planet a lot of computer generation and blue screening is used as well to make hobbits and dwarves look smaller than their environment and peers but this is high rate computer generation a rare thing today so you wont notice and itll keep you guessing on how they did it dvd ok now that i got through most of the plot even though it would take me a few pages to go through everything i wanted to now i should mention the dvd itself i myself bought the widescreen edition which is superior to the full screen edition in almost every aspect you get to see more of the screen and its not shrunk down to an annoying level to make viewing difficult the menus on the dvd are magnificent and i couldnt have thought of a better one myself but there is one minor minor beef with it though on the first disc the feature disc there is an extras option in the menu but when you select it you are given a message saying please insert disc which kind of makes you wonder why they even put it on the first disc to begin with i dont care really so its no biggy extras the extras arent really super abundant but the ones that are there are pretty cool and are worth mentioning there are a few tv specials that are pretty interesting and a lot of little clips that tell how they made the movie also some actor interviews and some trailers people complain that there isnt a two towers trailer but you can see just about everything the trailer has to offer in the behind the scenes of two towers preview two towers is the next movie in the trilogy if you didnt know overall overall i would only recommend this dvd if you are just a fan of the basic edition of the movie why do i say this well even though the movie is hours long they still removed a lot of essential stuff from it if you are a hardcore fan of the movie that needs all of the cut scenes and discs full of extras including the two towers trailers then i would wait for the extended edition that is coming soon the extended edition will be hours and will bear total discs to get its point across that this movie definitely gets what it deserves on home video the widescreen edition is only for people that want the short version as long as it is of lotr all in all get the extended edition in november 
ive never read tolkiens classic book the lord of the rings but having seen the movie im really looking forward to reading it this surely is a sign of an excellent thoroughtly enjoyable movie the fellowship of the ring is the first part of the trilogy but i simply cant wait another few years to find out how this fascinating story will conclude even though it lasts for practically hours the whole movie just seemed to breeze by the audiences attention is gripped from the very first moments as the scenario is set it includes a spectacular scene as the forces of men seek to protect middle earth from the forces of evil its going to go down in cinematic history as one of those truly spectacular moments yet it continues to have startling settings throughout the film that are really breath taking from scenes in forests to gothic castles from cute hobbit villages to the dark underground mines there are just so many amazing scenes the effects are incredible too the detail and make up of the dark soldiers and warriors to the computer animated effects of trolls and fire breathing monsters it really is a visual feast i have heard some people say that the opening film is a bit chaotic in that the viewer is bombarded with hordes of strange characters and that some may be confused by the introductions of strange new worlds and all their own particular nuances i have to say i felt this was far from true the movie moves along at a reasonable rate so that its easy for the viewer to become familiar with all these characters and worlds and yet it doesnt delve into over complicated detail each of the characters in the fellowship is developed enough to become pretty interesting even better are some of the people they meet on their journey in particular the part played by cate blanchett there are no weak performances christopher lee is scary self elijah woods is truly excellent in the part of frodo baggins funnily enough liv tyler gets a very prominent billing in the credits yet she doesnt have a very prominent part in the film maybe she becomes more important in the second one there is no point in me trying to divulge the story as so much happens plus it would sort of ruin some of the films many surprises the one thing i did feel was that the ending was really building you up for the second movie taken in itself it would seem to be a pretty weak and unresolved ending but then this really whets the appetite for the next part as i said i cant wait that long to see what happens so ive just got to read the book this is one of the most specatcular movies youll ever see i bet its sort of like what star wars was like for the people who first saw that way back in the s unmissable 
i remember reading on a home theatre website that lotr was going to be released in a theatrical version first followed by a directors cut later on upon reading that i was furious im here to say now that if you can serve up my words on a platter i will eat them it still kind of bugs me that i almost bought two versions of this film but the extended version does add so much excellent backstory and detail to the main film that i admit it was well worth the wait not one person that ive shown this film to has not liked it this is truly epic filmmaking and should be not necessarily budget or special effects wise but in vision directing and acting the baseline of what constitutes a quot good film quot i cannot recommend this film any higher 
superlatives fail me it took j r r tolkien fifteen years to write his opus the lord of the rings lotr of which this particular film covers the first third the fellowship of the ring fotr it took peter jackson a new zealand native five years to bring tolkiens work from ink and paper to the visual feast of film condensing lotrs words to three movies now finally fotr has arrived in the theaters for the christmas season of anticipation is huge lotr is one of the most widely read books worldwide as is expectation tolkien purists are an exacting demanding lot and while casting decisions and early imagery releases seemed to conform to that of the text several interesting and disturbing revisions changes also arose leaving some sighing with relief and others gnashing their teeth at the prospect of a deleted tom bombidil or a beefed up love story between arwen and aragorn as someone who has read the book four times i have to say that my expectations were probably as high as any especially after watching the marvelous trailers for fotr thus i joined an eager audience on dec th to witness this long awaited event excited and extremely nervous and luckily i left my expectations at the door the tone and dialogue of the prologue gripped me immediately and though my inner purist had a couple gripes where was gil galad the emergence of sauron mace in hand dashed my hopes and doubts with a brutal swing and upon entering the shire all reservation was lost the vibrant colors and earthy textures of hobbiton the stunning design the deft characterizations all pulled me in and for three short hours i was lost completely and utterly lost in this marvelous film afterward i reeled out of the theater with a dozen scenes fighting for dominance in my memory through it all i realized that this was near enough to the perfect adaptation for tolkiens work and having watched the movie a second time ive come to the conclusion that peter jackson has not only faithfully reproduced all that essential to fotr he has also improved on the book in several important ways i do have a few nitpicks as well but they stem more from the suits at new line than the man behind the camera what works pacing purists may disagree but the pacing of the original book was rather flawed conflict tension is minimal and the hobbits seem more content to eat and sing than take the ring seriously anyone who has read christopher tolkiens the history of middle earth will discover that tolkien himself had no strong idea of where lotr should go thus the long wanderings in both story and prose before the other elements of the story come together heck in the first couple drafts the ringwraiths didnt exist frodo was named bingo and strider was a hobbit with wooden legs named trotter given the enormous amount of exposition at the start of the film jacksons decision to excise tom b the old woods the barrow wights and the dawdling therein was a necessary one film and writing are two different mediums one must remember and what works for one might not for the other and vice versa that said jackson did an excellent job of balancing the relevant information character introduction exploration and action all the while tossing in the odd tidbit for the hardcore tolkien fans proudfeet expanding the moria and amon hen sequences helped raise the overall tension tremendously another improvement on the source material tolkien was never much one for sweat and sinew action only the lothlorian segment and a few of the traveling scenes are cut too close to the bone script it took two years and three participating individuals to properly condense tolkiens epic into a script format the end result is a marvel capturing the key dialogue of the book while making important and seamless improvisions on the material mostly for the sake of humor and character development character development a massive improvement on the source material tolkien didnt so much write characters as he did archetypes the movie gives them depth emotion conflict and nobility above and beyond the text the entire cast of the movie is superb yet even better is how each actor inhabits his or her character through speech and facial expressions sean bean expresses the pathos of boromirs inner turmoil viggo mortenson manages through subtle gestures to show aragorns doubt strength and resolve ian holm is bilbo pure and simple in fact all of the hobbits are well cast and seem to be true comrades not actors pulling together for a paycheck and the twin forces of ian mckellen and chris lee as warring istari blaze through the mm gandalf and saruman in character and conflict are flat out fantastic the score ill be brief here as i plan on reviewing the score separate suffice to say it is an elegant subtle piece highlighting the tensions and echoing the imagery without ever really calling attention to itself it mirrors the peaks and valleys of the movie without exception the true mark of a successful score well done howard shore the nits not many apparently new line told jackson to bring fotr to three hours so as to guarantee a return profit and not scare away the uninitiated with an extreme viewing length thirty minutes were cut from the final directors cut the sum and whole of my nits extend from these forced cuts the film does feel rushed in certain places and the butchering of the gift giving scene in lothlorian is almost unforgivable but hope is to be found in the upcoming dvd where those minutes will must be restored in conclusion fotr was one of the most satisfying film experiences ive ever had a rich majestic interpretation that compliments and adds flavor to the original work and this is only the beginning folks the fact that jackson handled fotr arguably the most difficult and slowest book of the three this well shows that the two towers and return of the king should really be something a mere year will tell but anyone who loves epic film and or tolkien should not be disappointed less than five stars would be an injustice 
i decided to hold off reviewing this beloved epic until i have seen it in its entirety and now that i have i confidently and enthusiastically cry out a big wow for the most impressive epic film ever made every single aspect of this film is infused with peter jacksons director ingenious and exquisite vision the colossal production is very evident throughout the trilogy and the mesmerizing special effects are exactly that mesmerizing filming this epic in one shot was perhaps the most brilliant idea peter jackson had for this film over the past three years every december fans take off from where we left off the previous year without feeling a discrepancy here or there in the characters the landscape or pace its as if we were suspended in the no time zone for a year after year ready to experience the magic of the ring the ensemble cast is magnificent as well i cannot pick favorites even though i loved sam gamgee for that every single actor did an outstanding job depicting his her character and together they played an ethereal symphony beethovenian in caliber j r r tolkiens characters represented the full gamut of human nature and peter jackson was able to recreate that on the screen with stark detail from the peace loving innocent hobbits to the evil and sinister orcs lies the perpetually confused unpredictable man the epic in a way represents the microcosm of life a perpetually peculiar battle between perceived good and perceived evil fall from grace confusion dilemmas hard decisions community strength courage and triumph are some of the many underlying themes of this universally adored work of art some people have dismissed this film as a fantasy flick but in reality it is an epic with an incredible impact like that of ben hurs spartacus and gladiators combined this film is one of my all time favorites and i do recommend it to all 
with all the additions to make the special edition of the movie this is well worth getting additionally all the extras are fun and entertaining as well even to the video commentaries that can be listened to as the movie plays 
id forgotten that film was an art form especially since hollywood churns out so much brainless garbage however this is no lame excuse for a movie everything is immaculately conceived produced presented and edited the artistry of the set costume prop designers is overwhelming the attention to deatil is enriching and the cast do marvelous work with a fabulous epic the movie doesnt follow the book perfectly but i actually thought the revisions made the story more not less clear the books can drone on and on so it was awesome to get a feel for the emotion and excitement perhaps because we live in such a visually centered culture but i needed to see the story to finally fall into it this move is amazing an event actually anyone who cant see that this is a wonderful movie is either looking at it from a perspective that i simply cant understand or way too picky tell the tolkein heads that give this less than stars to do better than this if they think they can an instant classic
there are alot of reasons why lotr tfotr is the ultimate fantasy epic of our times its the deepest darkest and most intense epic movie ever made behind the two towers ive read the book several times over the years and i definately can say that this movie almost pulled every image that i came up with out of my head and put them onto the screen the whole movie has a dark and engaging sense of adventurism intensity and desperation that alot of other fantasy movies lack simply because lotr is so complex and multi dimensional that it would be almost impossible to surpass for eons to come i personally recommend getting the collectors gift set if you can find it as it offers so much more than the vhs edition and it also doesnt wear out as easily as the vhs get this movie and get teh gift set for the best purchase ever 
i saw this movie in the movie theater and i was on the edge of my seat the whole time this movie was intriguing and excellently acted you see some veteran actors like ian mckellan christopher lee hugo weaving and some new faces like gorgeous orlando bloom as legolas huge props go out to viggo mortenson as aragorn cate blanchett as galadriel sean astin as sam elijah wood as frodo liv tyler as arwen and dominic monaghan as merry and whoever else i forgot to mention the graphics and costumes used for this movie were nothing less than amazing i dont even want to imagine how long it took to do all the orcs uruk hai goblins and hobbits as well as the others probably half a day well it was worth it for all the awards it raked in and all the glowing reviews it was given the battle scenes are breathtaking and necessary to show how easy it is to be corrupted by great power if frodo could just waltz into mount doom and destroy the ring there would be no story and there is no easy way out like that some people say this movie is an escape from real life no a lot of your characters represent the modern world sauron represents satan and how he so easily corrupts people the nazgul and orcs show what happens to you when you allow yourself to be really corrupted by evil the fellowship represnts the small but faithful followers that eventually triumph in the end men represent the weak minded people in our society and the elves represent the cynics and pessimists that have to learn to pull their heads out of their butts and trust people the dwarves are power hungry bullies all bark but no bite like of our world sam is the best friend everybody wishes they had and arwen is the loving future wife every man wishes they could find if i had to find somebody who was the most like god it would be a toss up between aragorn and gandalf aragorn represents the powerful leader that rises up once more to triumph over darkness and gandalf symbolizes reincarnation and the strong willed followers that would be willing to even die for the cause of good this is probably why i like this trilogy so much because you have characters you can relate tonow let me take a moment to bash this one idiot reviewer named mike young who had the balls to compare this great flick to dungeons and dragons hey mike dungeons and dragons is a flagrant cheap rip off of lord of the rings there isnt even a basis for comparison d d was created by some high school nerd in the s and doesnt deserve to be in the same league as lotr if youre so hell bent on dungeons and dragons fine but dont go bashing this movie just to shoot your mouth off about a stupid game and movie that havent even won any decent rewards much less grossed the sales lord of the rings has think about that to summarize this movie not as thrilling as return of the king but better than the two towers i have no regrets about buying this dvd or the others and i believe this will still be a great movie for years to come 
if you have read the hobbit and the rings trilogy you must be missing the world of middle earth the newly released movie quot lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring quot will take you back everything is here frodo samwise merry pippin and all the rest and the visuals are just the way you imagined it would be early in the movie gandalf approaches bilbos home and you recognize it from your minds eye as he approaches everything else matches rivendale moria and the rest you probably read the book more than once you will see the movie more than once also 
this is one of those films that you just have to have on bluray its so visually stunning and seeing it in full hd in the living room is almost a requirement the extras disc is actually a dvd but thats fine i really bought this just for the movie of the three lord of the rings films this is the best with a great story set up and character development for the price you cant beat owning this 
in my younger pre christian days i was one of those early s lotr fetishists and there were enough of us around to outnumber all the fell hordes of mordor who who regarded tolkiens meisterwerk as something of a spiritual map ive outgrown quite such an un nuanced belief in tolkiens grasp on eternal truth in fact the last time i read the book i was a little dare i so much as whisper it even in the well lit halls of rivendell cringed by the political incorrectness the imperialistic assumptions the sheer darn chauvinism of the narrative literary fashions move on and tolkien is an increasingly dated form of cool but then the same could be said of shakespeare lotr still ranks as my favourite novel of all time and it shows every sign of being the most enduring piece of classical literature to come out of the english speaking world in the th century in a generation that is steeped in sword and sorcery imagery it is so easy to forget that allowing for his largely unacknowledged debt to wagner tolkien invented that whole industry single handedly in the light of all this pseudo spiritual baggage i was highly sceptical that anyone could ever translate the essence of the tale into another format previous attempts in the animation and rpg media had not helped to inspire confidence after all it was reading tolkien that taught so many people what used to be quite a rare feat of visualising fantastical landscapes and creatures for themselves middle earth was almost designed as a solipsistic bolt hole from reality how could anyone put visual clothing on it for others of course the secret of jacksons success is that the world of fantasy landscape creatures has become a mature global industry there is now a little noticed but very real consensus among the book reading film going and game playing public as to what lonely mountains evil fortresses and all manner of hobgoblins should look like this consensus has been nurtured and built up by illustrators film set designers graphic artists computer programmers and the like over the last thirty years or so through a broad conformity that like radioactive half life has transcended their individuality it has even in a manner well understood by literary historians re shaped the way the book will be visualised in the imagination of people who first read the book far earlier most of these die hard fans of the original book will be unaware of how much flesh has been put onto their original private visualisation of the story by these external inputs but it is axiomatic that we visualise the unfamiliar strictly in terms of what we know it follows that the original individualistic numinous wholly other and possibly acid tinged landscape that existed in the minds of many older readers has been gradually and subtly been supplanted by the more mundane and concrete imagery from a generation of picture books calendar and poster artwork films and computer games all that middle earth has been waiting for then is for someone to come along with the technology the budget and the elephantine ambition to sum up thirty years of this cross media artistic consensus and flow it round a simplified story line lifted from tolkiens books thus the original inspiration for the genre and its entire progeny are joined together we have come full circle as far as the fantasy industry is concerned the creative cycle is complete this may just be long winded wibble but it may help to explain why so many filmgoers including people who like myself have been reading the books over and over again for decades came out of the theatre wondering how jackson could have read their minds so accurately in one sense of course it is all a psychological trick in a nutshell the creative media have been telling us for so many years what a magic world looks like we have all forgotten what it looked like when we were left to picture it for ourselves but then again all artistic appreciation is guided by social convention much of jacksons phenomenal achievement lies in how he has tapped into that collective consciousness how in other words he has held a mirror up to our cultural soul in consequence as a theatrical release this film is just about the most roundly satisfactory watching experience i can remember the three hours go like a flash and i am looking forward to all night lord of the rings complete sessions once all three episodes are on release i am less convinced that the films vast visual and sonic impact can ever be conveyed in home video format particularly on pre wide screen kit however in the balance i am optimistic this isnt just a visual spectacle it is a finely scripted theatrical work using an abnormally large amount of the original authors own dialogue the stripped down story line of the movie works well in its own right both as a self contained epic and as feeder to the larger trilogy to come the casting is a major achievement all by itself the acting performances are all with the exception of one or two senior elves exemplary ian holm bilbo and sean bean boromir are particularly intense and moving as the characters with the most internal torment to convey that much at least will come across in any format if you ever liked tolkien or fantasy art generally this will be one to buy and keep 
just an incredible piece of film making have to say im not a fan of the swords and wizards genre not a sci fi fan either so i went in wanting to not like it but it won me over perfect casting perfect visuals an engrossing story line a great movie dont listen to the people who tell you its boring its long or that its a star wars rip off i keep hearing this um this was written just a few years before star wars go see it let yourself go and enjoy a great ride 
im always skeptical of directors cuts most of them merely add a few minutes of scenes that should have stayed on the cutting room floor and seem like they were added just to put a few more minutes onto the running time but this is one directors cut that i would love to see in the theatre the added scenes fill out the story line add dimension to the characters and are beautifully produced just for the dvd they blend in seamlessly to the original cut and are full of gems such as the opening scene where bilbo gives the audience a short primer on hobbits showing wonderful shots of hobbiton not seen in the theatrical release it also has many scenes of song and poems that are reminiscent of the books and add flavor to the film i highly recommend this dvd and i only hope that we will see more directors cuts like this in the future 
i had been looking for this in full screen and found it here it was in great shape and it came very fast 
the fellowship of the ring just plain took my breath away it far exceeded my expectations especially with the crop of books to movies that have made it to the big screen in the past years considering that a theatrical release is first and foremost expected to earn back the cost of production and marketing i fully expected most of the storyline to belost in bringing this incredible tale to the big screen you can just imagine my complete surprise at how truly faithful this screen adaptation ended up being as i re read this story again i see the wisdom in why certain portions of the novel had to be selectively left out as one reviewer also noted leaving out tom bombadil did nothing to diminish the story and yet some liberties with the story were of course inevitable and although i didnt agree with some of them they were ultimately in my opinion excusable chiefly because of the sheer scope and how truly magificent this epic turned out choosing new zealand was an absolute stroke of genius nowhere on earth today anyway can you find scenery that could compete with the imaginative brilliance that tolkien brought to life in his description of middle earth if this country indeed looks like what i saw on the big screen this is a place i need to visit i simply cannot say enough about how well this epic was made from the totally believable image of the hobbits being so much smaller than most other races to the entrance to moria which isvirtually a clone of the depiction found within the pages of the book and on rare moments when i could hear conversations between characters that i recalled are word for word the same in the novel i went back and checked just for the fun of it hands down the best film i have seen this year if not several and recommend it highly to any and all fans of these masterful works of fiction as in all things there will be those die hard fans who would rather see nothing if not an exact replica of the stories which is impossible for so many reasons that cannot be written here but for those who can appreciate whattolkien wrote and how a task of placing this image on the big screen is really one major difficult job will end up not just loving this movie but also look forward to the two towers which comes out december kudos to those responsible forthis visual treat i am thrilled that it was done so well andultimately so faithful that alone is tribute enough to the memory of tolkiens fantastic adventures 
ive never read the lord of the rings trilogy i must confess ive tried a couple of times to read the fellowship of the ring but i just couldnt get into it going into the movie i was worried that id be confused and unsure of the plot this worry grew when the theatre did a trivia game before the movie and everyone in the audience seemed to know everything about the books my worries were completely unfounded the film opens with an outstanding introduction a kind of prologue a friend told me that this discusses the details of quot the hobbit quot the book that comes before the fellowship of the ring the prologue was wonderful it told me everything i needed to know but also took my breath away in three minutes i understood everything i needed to know to get into the story the rest of the movie was unbelievably beautiful sad suspenseful and action packed i couldnt believe how easily the film switched tones one minute exciting the next sad and the next introspective in fact one aspect of the film that i wasnt expecting was the amount of suspense i actually jumped a couple of times in my seat the acting was awesome something somewhat rare for a fantasy film quot willow quot anyone and the special effects were seamless it was hard to tell what was computer generated and what was real the ending left me wanting more even after hours and i cant wait for the next film the last five minutes seemed so simple yet they almost brought me to tears i must congratulate peter jackson for creating such a vivid world in my mind the scenery the characters the story they have all come to life for me much more than they could on paper not the best movie of all time and possibly not even the best movie of the year but still a out of highly recommended for ages and up due to the frightening scenes 
ive never met him but peter jackson must love his fans more than any director in the world he certainly loves his subject matter with this dvd set jackson and co have given us what could very well be the most comprehensive dvd release ever made like the movie itself it is a labor of love and it comes through i bought the first dvd release and at the time i was whining about the studio targeting weak willed fans like myself who would buy both versions like helpless crack heads or more accurately like ring craving gollums watching them both side by side you can tell that one is a studio release while the other is a directors release while jackson may be avoiding the term directors cut like the plague i cant think of a more accurate description jackson put a ton of work into the extended version amassed a plethora of special features then wrapped it in a beautiful package and released it at a modest price the extended version of the movie is very nice its hard to say it makes the movie better because it was already one of the greatest movies ever made but it does give you more of the same more greatness cant be a bad thing i know a lot of chowder heads that actually didnt like fellowship because it was too long doubtless these individuals would be better served watching adam sandler movies or taking a little nappy if they didnt like it before they will probably loathe it now the additional footage does slow the pace down some what but anyone who ever read the books knows that the pace was never as frantic as portrayed in the film i think fans of the books will be best served by the extended cut there are details now included that many crybaby purists can now wipe their eyes and stop sniveling about i thought the movie was fantastic as it was i actually know someone that complained about bill the pony not being featured more bill the pony i kid you not frankly if bill and tom bombadil have to be sacrificed to make room for what is included it was not in vain ill admit that i havent completely explored all the features on this disk but anyone claiming to have done so this soon after the release is either lying to you or fooling themselves it is an incredible amount of information ive watched quite a few of the documentaries and they are excellent some of the more technical ones like the one on digital grading are very interesting but its the ones with the cast and crew telling stories that i found most interesting and down right entertaining one of the things that everyone in the cast talks about is how there was as much fellowship off the screen as on and you can really tell some of the stories and behind the scenes stuff is laugh out loud funny you can tell everyone had a good time making the movies and usually when people are having a good time it comes through in their work im usually not interested in the off screen hijinks of movie stars but the cool thing about this cast is that many of them arent really stars and some are actually new to film making they lack a pretentiousness and snootiness that they hopefully will never pick up with their inevitable fame and fortune the history of the books and the author was also pretty interesting even if its been better told elsewhere the huge gift set comes with the national geographic special on the lord of the rings and its pretty comprehensive ive only seen snippets of it but i have every intention of owning it the documentaries do go into the themes of the book and tolkiens dislike of allegory the books are meant to be timeless belonging to no particular age or social situation undoubtedly this is their greatest strength and one that jackson has gone to great lengths to translate its wonderful to think we have two more movies to go there is so much information and entertainment wrapped up in this first expanded edition set that i cant fathom having all three on my shelf while im not surprised that the first film was snubbed at the oscars nor will i be surprised when the other two are snubbed for best picture i think time will show these movies to be the greatest single cinematic piece ever created we are watching history in the making 
j r r tolkiens beloved lord of the rings comes to life on the big screen in peter jacksons excellent adaptation this movie is superior from begining to end although it runs right at hours the action and suspense held my attention throughout and left me wanting more the actors ian mckellen as the great gandalf the gray elijah wood as the young hobbit frodo viggo mortensen as the swashbuckling aragorn sean astin as frodos companion sam and ian holm as the aging but wise bilbo give riveting performances throughout the film the special effects are top notch especially the battle with the balrog of moria and the numerous encounters with the mysterious orcs anyone who has read the beloved tolkien trilogy knows the story of the ring and it is accurately told in the film the ending is left wide open for the sequel the two towers which i am eagerly anticipating watch this exciting film which should rank as one of the greatest fantasy films ever and experience the wonders of middle earth 
the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is triumphant proof that despite frequent evidence to the contrary it is possible to adapt excellent books into equally excellent films of course at the heart of any good film is a good story and this is provided par excellence by j r r tolkien in a time before recorded history the peaceful inhabitants of middle earth are threatened by the reappearance of a long lost ring in which resides the life force of the evil dark lord sauron seemingly by chance the ring comes to young hobbit frodo baggins who must destroy it by throwing it back into the fires from whence it was forged in his quest he is joined by a wizard two men a dwarf an elf and three hobbits representatives of the free people of middle earth whom together form the titular fellowship this film is monumental in scale but it is director peter jacksons attention to detail and the all important and sadly oft forgotten humanity involved that really makes it a masterpiece although the black faceless ringwraiths the orc and goblin hordes and the claustrophobic darkness of the mines of moria are certainly frightening the moment when the viewer truly realises the insidious evil of the ring is when kindly bumbling uncle bilbo baggins becomes for a split second only a raving demon in its presence the outstanding cast has made it easy to become involved with the characters and the computer graphics wizardry of isengard and rivendell et al is astonishing and almost seamless ultimately any film which after almost three hours can leave a viewer exclaiming no it cant end there i want to see what happens next is well worth watching roll on the sequel 
this is one of the best movies i have and will ever see the acting was great and very believable elijah wood he did a lot better than i thought he would this movie in not disappointing in the slightest way i have seen it three times with my friends and family and i have read all of the books so trust me i just hope that the next two movies will be just as great as this one 
i loved this movie in my top five of all time as i saw it times in the theatre i was skeptakle after reading the book about how they would be able to pull it off but they did it i do not know how but they did it is different than the book in many aspects but all the plot lines and themes are kept in tact peter jackson did a wonderful job adapting the screen play and then putting it onto the big screen i have seen the trailor to the two towers and it looks equally as impressive the actors were briliant the special effects where like a james cameron film and the sets were beautiful and finally the score was moving great music it really added an extra punch to some very poingant scenes it can get a bit violent at times so you may not want to show it to your kids if they are too young but that is your judgement i just wish it was december so that i coulds see the next one 
there is not much more to say about this masterpiece except with regards to the dvd release there will actually be seperate offerings version everything already listed on this site plus a dolby digital surround ex sound transfer version release date nov my birthday is the must be a sign hours of original behind the scenes footage not contained on the st edition minutes of additional footage not just a supplement or rough cut extra but actual scenes that had to be trimmed for its theatrical release due to time constraints and my favorite part an honest to goodness dts discrete sound mix a dolby digital ex mix will be included also this will be a massive disc set with the first two discs consisting of what will be a hour and minute film and the last discs will contain the hours of extras rd release also nov th a special collectors edition box set with argonath bookends and all the extras contained in the nd edition plus additional extras to be announced at a later date this is the one i fully expect the fans to snap up how couldnt you if you call yourself a true fanatic of this film to the casual admirers i would suggest the first edition to the average admirer who considers sound important the nd edition to the obsessive the box set is a must thank you the studios are finally embracing the dts discrete technology matrix is servicable also but still not as effective and this is a film that shouldnt be experienced any other way 
i am a lifelong fan of the quot the lord of the rings quot and as such im sure i wasnt alone in fearing that a film adaptation would ruin the magic of the story i neednt have worried as peter jacksons first installment the fellowship of the ring does a remarkable job of transferring tolkiens work to the big screen yes tom bombadil is absent and arwen is given a greater role to offer something for female fans but the essence along with almost all of the substance is there in the extended edition the viewer is treated to an additional half hour of footage there is more exposition on hobbits at the beginning of the film the battle against the goblins and cave troll in moria was extended and a few other vignettes were added however what long time fans will be most pleased to see is galadriels gift giving scene the whole scene is beautifully conceived and executed and sam and particularly gimli reveal new aspects of their personalities through it now for the specifics of this set discs amp comprise the film and commentaries for those of you who havent seen the film yet the director peter jackson chose his native land of new zealand as the location of middle earth i cant imagine that he could have made a better choice while there is a great deal of cgi in this film for the most part it is used to supplement rather than replace the landscape for instance a ruin might be inserted to imbue with history an otherwise gorgeous but perhaps disconnected landscape as a result the cinematography has a feeling of being grounded of being real that one would never get from a george lucas effects extravaganza the film begins with a history of the ring of power drawn from not only the lord of the rings and the hobbit but the silmarillion and other of tolkiens writings as well while not true to the form of the novel it does a superb job of imbuing the rest of the film with a real sense of history in fact throughout the film it is jacksons ability to ground the film in an alternate reality that makes it so successful the viewer doesnt feel so much like they are watching fantasy as they are watching the history of some remote time i havent listened to all of the commentary yet at almost hours it will take a while but the pieces i listened two were for the most part interesting and lively which is surprising considering how dry such features can sometimes be one thing that struck me is how much passion everyone associated with the project has for it it really comes across that this was a labor of love which goes a long way towards explaining why the film was so successful discs amp are without a doubt the best collection of behind the scenes special features i have ever encountered from the start which is an absolutely brilliant history of tolkien and his works all the way through to the final post production tweaks the viewer is treated to an in depth but never dull look at the creation of middle earth i rarely watch of the behind the scenes footage on other discs because it has a tendency to be dry and geared towards the real film nut in this instance though there is enough substance to satisfy even the most voracious film historian while not being overwhelming to the layperson furthermore all of the features are always firmly rooted in the context of the fellowship of the ring the documentary never strays into theoretical jargon or technical challenges rather it focuses on how the film was made and the obstacles that were overcome in addition to the tolkien biography that i already mentioned and which is the best i have seen anywhere i particularly enjoyed the features on the cast and the costumes the cast feature does a remarkable job of showing how the primary actors really gelled into a real life fellowship of their own and the costume feature is absolutely brilliant as i shows the overwhelming volume of costumes and particularly armor that was required the make middle earth come alive finally there is a national geographic documentary on tolkien and the lord of the rings included although it is separate from the boxed set its actually a pretty good documentary in and of itself but it is really overwhelmed by discs amp there is no possible way that they could have covered the length and breadth of middle earth to the same degree that said there are some interesting moments particularly tolkiens fascination with the finnish epic the kalevala the fellowship of the ring is the superb first installment of what is destined to be a classic trilogy of films while not always exact in its correlation to the book it nonetheless does an excellent job of capturing the key components of tolkiens work honor duty and above all friendship at the same time the dvds really raise the bar for what constitutes special features aside from spectacular picture and sound there are hours of fascinating features that should answer just about any question you could come up with about the film or its production 
it seems almost impossible but peter jacksons film of the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring achieves the very sense of the first book of in tolkiens trilogy in addition it covers cleverly the events of the hobbit by having bilbo baggins begin the film writing his memoirs on the eve of his farewell party in the shire this is just one example of how the screenwriters were able to merge so much expository information into the limited time available during a film the scenery is nothing short of amazing this is the shire looking like a fairy version of pastoral england filmed in new zealand however and the hobbit lodges are cleverly constructed the camera and sets trick your eye into seeing the hobbits as halflings next to the normal sized gandalf the wizard later on in the film computer graphics help to create monumental battle scenes against the orcs and wraiths the only problem is that these scenes tend to drag and even though this is a magical story fifty or so orcs against the nine of the fellowship seems a bit hard to accept on the screen and it is all too apparent that the filmmakers chose to slow the pace down when they went for a trilogy rather than a single film for the entire lord of the rings cycle this makes the second half of the film on the second dvd a bit slow and dreary especially as it is filmed predominantly in gray tones rather than the bright colors of the shire you will need a bit of sitzfleisch patience to sit through the second half this is just quibbling however the script and the actors are amazing the special effects and computer graphics dramatic and true to the book elijah woods as frodo never fails to capture the screen with his unearthly looks and fine acting sir ian mckellens gandalf is just right he doesnt dominate frodo but supports him ably we are treated to a host of marvelous cast members from liv tyler as arwen sean bean sharps rifles as boromir cate blanchett as the unearthly elf queen galadriel hugo weaving the matrix as elrond well i could go on but the cast is just perfect in every choice the fellowship of the ring is a monumental achievement in film and will win over even those who are not fans of tolkien now to the extras the bio of tolkien is a must see his childhood in birmingham england and his education at oxford give important background into how he was able to create such a complete mythical world with language alphabet and sagas his moral take on the ring as a symbol of humanitys choice to follow evil is enlightening the interviews with the script writers is equally interesting all in all disc from vision to reality is an important adjunct to viewing the film i wasnt a particular tolkien fan though i read the books as a child i really now am interested in tolkien and this film did more than justice to a monumental classic 
the fellowship of the ring is the first film in the lord of the rings trilogy it tells the story of frodo baggins a hobbit from the shire frodo is given a ring by his uncle bilbo this ring is the mythical one ring that the dark lord covets and once held he knows that the ring is in the shire and that a baggins has the ring the wizard gandalf sets frodo on a path away from the shire so that the sauron the dark lord cannot regain the ring and overwhelm middle earth in the process frodo comes in the company of elves dwarves and men in his quest to destroy the ring in the fires of mordor this is the opening chapter of the epic tale this dvd is the extended edition what that means is that peter jackson the director took his theatrical version of the film and reinserted approximately minutes of additional footage back into the movie some scenes are snippets and extensions of existing scenes but others are entirely new scenes this extended edition is as peter jackson says an alternate version of the film i feel that it is a much stronger and richer version of fellowship it feels more complete and because of the additions it is closer to the text of j r r tolkien besides the extended edition of the film which i feel is superior to the theatrical release we are also given two bonus discs of special features these are various documentaries of nearly every possible aspect of the making of the movie one bonus disc is about how peter jackson and crew adapted the book and was able to make it into a movie the second bonus disc is how peter jackons vision of the film was crafted into the finished product we saw on screen there are or hours of bonus material and watching all of the bonus footage i was stunned by the amount of work that went into making this movie all the information that you could possibly want to know about the making of the movie its on the dvd these are no promotional pieces but rather a detailed look at the filmmaking process if you are a fan of lord of the rings this is a must own dvd if you loved the theatrical version youll still want to check this one out it is a subtly different movie and it has a richer feel to it as far as dvd sets go this is one of the best 
 when peter jacksons movie came out i was instantly enthralled and so grateful that tolkien had been filmed by directors producers and actors who loved him as much as i do i didnt think it was possible to improve upon the theatrical release but now ive seen the extended edition and now i know that it is not only possible it has been done first the basics the platinum series extended edition collectors gift set comes with five dvds and a set of bookends representing the argonath the bookends are lovely but obviously meant for paperbacks one of the dvds is the national geographic special on new zealand and on the sources of tolkiens literary creations in england and elsewhere a treasure in itself then you have two dvds with the movie and two appendices make up the remaining two dvds ordinarily i dont care much about the extra material that comes with dvd releases but here the material enhances the story immeasurably the first appendix covers the story itself with a nice short biography of tolkien and much material about how the film was structured and planned there are a lot of nice shots and video clips showing story boards and early plans for the movie the second appendix covers the filming itself with a lot of fun material about what the actors and technicians went through for a period of more than a year it was interesting to see that the actors had generally the same personae as their film character the hobbits were fun loving and rollciking while viggo mortensen was a more serious solitary fellow of course all of this introductory material is as nothing compared to the main event the extended version of the film itself i think there are about more minutes of film in this version all of it is worthwhile and i dont want to spoil the magic for those of you who havent seen the new stuff suffice it to say that the delight you felt when viewing the theatrical version will be intensified immeasurably my particular favorite among the added scenes is a quick shot of some elves traveling through the shire on their way to the grey havens nothing so encapsulates the enormous depth behind the books and now the film as well youll find the same enchantment through every scene whether new extended or not 
 p from start to finish this film held my attention rare in and of itself the portrayals of gandalf by mckellan and frodo by wood are thier best performances to date peter jackson did an excellent job on this film everything looks as it should as i imagined the shire the faire city mount doom all of it pacing was good color was great music was just right am i gushing yes so what i want people to know that this film while intense in places is no more violent than saturday morning cartoons and much better written the death scenes were done tastefully with a minimum of blood and you felt thier loss as it should be i recently picked up a screening disc of this film and will probably watch it again a few times before the retail one is available why because i really liked it 
i should confess at the beginning that as a child of nine i read the lord of the rings my aunt read the hobbit to me when i was six or so and then introduced me to tolkiens longer work some years later i loved the book as a child and as an adult have returned from time to time to this bit of quot comfort literature quot in which a grown up can certainly find new things i had expected to be disappointed with peter jacksons film not because i am some sort of tolkien purist but because as i get older and know more of the world it seems harder to find real wonder in film the first star wars movies created the contemporary notion of the quot blockbuster quot spawning summer after summer of over hyped junkfood cinema for every raiders of the lost ark there are dozens of films like independence day tomb raider and armageddon that promise the world and deliver an empty experience during the five minute prologue which explains the history of the ring i feared endless esoteric exposition and tedium my concerns were misplaced the opening scenes with ian mckellen and ian holm are touching and immersive one feels one is seeing old friends reunited in some fantastic world rings only got better after that revealing itself to be one of the most impressive bits of movie making i have ever seen the film reminds me of some of the great epics and adventure movies of the past flicks like star wars king kong raiders of the lost ark and lawrence of arabia virtually everything about the film works very well acting cinematography special effects and editing all serve the story and the development of the characters nothing is wasted and one cannot help but be impressed with jacksons work on rings jackson has gone to extraordinary lengths to faithfully adapt the book while creating an excellent film and all the major themes from the novel are there he should be applauded for this not picked to pieces i am annoyed by tolkien fundamentalists who seem to think that every word written in rings is somehow sacred they should be very thankful that jackson has made the changes that he did changes that are faithful to the complexities of the story yet create a very effective movie i suggest that tolkien purists not see the film if the changes will bother them 
i never thought a superb adaptation of tolkiens the lord of the rings would ever appear on the screen yet peter jackson has accomplished the impossible offering a splendid adaptation of fellowship of the ring which remains true to j r r tolkiens vision even if it sacrifices nearly a tenth of the plot he does an admirable job emphasizing the trials and tribulations awaiting frodo baggins and the rest of his company elijah wood is a memorable frodo baggins orlando bloom is fine as legolas john rhys davis is a splendid glimli replete with all of his taciturn manners yet along with elijah wood the acting accolades go deservedly to viggo mortenson as strider aragorn and especially ian mckellan as gandalf who deserves an academy award nomination for best supporting actor other excellent performances include those of sean bean as boromir sean astin as samwise gamgee christopher lee as saruman the wise liv tyler as arwen and cate blanchett as galadriel yet there isnt one false note shown by any of the actors since they all do admirable jobs bringing the denizens of middle earth to life some have criticized raising arwens liv tyler stature as a character in the film since she is hardly mentioned in the novel yet jacksons instincts are correct since she will play an important part later in the saga as aragorns viggo mortenson lover i also appreciate the films emphasis on sarumans christopher lee treachery which is only hinted at in the text i have seen fellowship of the ring twice it is a sumptuous visual feast for the eyes as well as a nail biting swashbuckler of a film it harkens back to the great film epics of the s s and s with its own epochal sense of film making its been the most enjoyable three hours of film i have seen in a long long time unquestionably despite jacksons and his co writers liberal adaptation of tolkiens tale it remains the finest adaptation of a literary classic i have seen the film is graced with an admirable film score by howard shore easily one of our foremost film composers i sincerely hope it earns an academy award nomination for best film score i look forward to seeing fellowship of the ring several more times before it ends its american theater run hopefully that wont be any time soon 
long time ago in ancient times middle earth was troubled by the evil power of dark lord sauron who caused various wars on the world for many rings for forged for many kings and lords but sauron crafted the one ring to rule them all after he was defeated his legacy and spirit lives on within the ring for it is a cursed object that can corrupt those that wield it including a poor soul named smeagol a k a gollum voiced and played by andy serkis that has taken over him for years until a hobbit named bilbo baggins ian holm took it away from him and had his adventure years later after the events of his battle against smaug he is celebrating his th birthday in a peaceful area known as the shire owned by halfling beings called hobbits and after the party he leaves the ring to his nephew frodo elijah wood as he goes off to rivendale for a long vacation retirement to be with the elves longtime friend of both frodo and bilbo known as gandolf the grey ian mckellen who is a wise and powerful wizard later finds out the secrets of the ring and discovers that sauron is back in mordor sending out armies of orcs goblins monsters and soldiers to make another major world on middle earth frodo goes on a quest with his friends samwise gamgee sean astin pippin billy boyd and merry dominac mongahan to destroy the one ring as they head all the way to rivendale where they must learn on where to destroy it nd joins up with more new friends such as aragon viggo morgenstein elfen archer legolas orlando bloom boromir sean bean and dwarf gimli john rhys davis to go on the quest for many years j r r tolkiens classic timeless fantasy adventure novels have been considered unfilmable as even said so by tolkein himself for studios have tried to bring lord of the rings to the screen in united artists got the rights as they wanted to have the beatles be the hobbits with john lennon as gollum and david bowie as gandolf with stanley kubrick as director as he denied it and considered it unfilmable then in ralph bakshi worked on getting the books to the screen with rankin bass doing the prequel called the hobbit released in then bakshis lord of the rings was released in to decent box office and mixed reviews as it covered only the first books but was unfinshed since bakshi wanted to do another movie but based on return of the king as he denied doing it so rankin bass decided to complete the unfinished animated lotr with s return of the king then in new line aquired the rights to have tolkeins books as movies for peter jackson was announced to write produce and direct each movie since he is a huge fan of tolkeins novels from till work began on lotr from writing the scripts designing costumes film location scouting set designing creature designing and make up effects to animatronics especially casting in till filming on all three movies started even on the amazing visual effects by weta i believe peter jackson has made a brilliant beginning to a masterful cinematic trilogy in the vein of the classic star wars movies the casting is just brilliant as i couldnt imagine anyone else but elijah wood for frodo and the legendary ian mckellen is just right the part of gandalf as well as his rival sarumon the white played by christopher lee co starring liv tyler as aragons elfen love interest arwen hugo weaven as her elfen king father elrond and a cameo by peter jackson himself the acting is just phenomenal and i also love the absorbing music score by howard shore who created his greatest score in his film history its been a wonderful labor of love for peter jackson who had a great cinematic task of bringing three books to the screen in glorious grand scale as i gotta thank you peter jackson for doing the impossible and doing tolkein and his fans proud this blu ray has brilliant flawless picture and awesome sound quality with great extras like trailers to this movie tv documentaries on this movie tv spots music video to enyas may it be song preview to the next movie and aragons quest game trailer 
i thought that it was the best movie that i have gone to see insome time and i have seen it at least times and will see it asmany times as i can before they take it out of the theater and i do have my name on the list for getting the movie on video when it comes out 
time and time again i have tried to sit down in front of my computer screen and write a review for this movie time and time again ive found myself sitting for hours staring blankly at the page before me trying to find the words to tell you how i feel about this movie to tell you how this movie changed my life and helped shape me into the person i am today the words never come because i never had them to begin with ive never been able to explain just what it is about this movie that touched me all those years ago in the front row of a crowded movie theater so i wont even try i wont try to explain the beauty and awe this film evokes from its viewers or the sense of peace one feels when watching it i wont talk about how the script is one of the most brilliant scripts ever written for a motion picture and i wont try to explain how lovely the musical score is all i will say is that this movie and the books it was based on changed my life in a very profound way it made me interested in reading which in turn planted the seed for my passion for writing it inspired me to create to learn to expand my view of the world to many this is just a movie nine hours of entertainment just like any other movie but to me its the panicle of success for film making one that puts to shame trilogies likethe ultimate matrix collection the matrix the matrix reloaded the matrix revolutions the animatrix orstar wars trilogy widescreen edition with bonus disc and that laughs at classics likecitizen kaneandseven samurai this to make it short is simply the best film ever made in the history of mankind 
as a self proclaimed tolkien enthusiast my friends usually use a different adjective its hard to separate the book from the movie and judge the movie purely on its merits and not the stark and sometimes disappointing differences the biggest example as it is for most fans of the lord of the rings is arwens amplified role watching her take frodo across the ford was hard to watch because her defense of him greatly diminished frodos strength in the book frodo himself struggling against the wound given to him by the ringwraith beat the nazgul to the ford and with great courage raised his sword against them in defiance also no whisperings of arwen brought the river crashing down on the nazgul as they attempted to cross that was the work of elrond and the figures of the horses the came out of the froth of the waves were gandalfs added touch this may seem like a minor point but it isnt tolkien was showing us the strength and resiliency of frodo and in a more general sense that of the diminutive race of hobbits thats the last ill say about the differences well maybe there were others some bothered my greatly others less but on to the film the construction of the shire was masterfully done when i saw the film in the theater im not ashamed to say that a tear formed in my eye they had done such a marvelous job of creating hobbiton that i felt i was actually seeing it as opposed to having read about so many times it was beautiful and moving since this is a fantasy one thing is more important than all others the magic it has to be believable and the people or beings who employ it must also be believable that is where the brilliance of ian mckellan came in without him the movie would have been much less than it was and i would imagine that most people either dont or cant comprehend why that isnt meant to be an insult its just that not many understand how essential it is that the magic be believable elrond seemed too harsh and im not comparing hugo weavings portrayal to my expectation for the lord of rivendell and the scene where frodo accepted the burden of taking the ring to mordor too short and therefore difficult to follow i saw the film with many people who had not read the books and they all had many questions regarding that in my mind almost all of my problems with the differences between the book and the movie were resolved once the characters entered moria i was absolutely blown away there was only one moment where i doubted that i was under a great mountain and that was when frodo and aragorn were standing together on the broken staircase falling forward i saw the blue screen effect otherwise balins tomb the tome gandalf read from and mckellans delivery the immensity of dwarrodelf which was the name that men gave for the underground city of moria the orcs crawling out of ever crack and crevice like crawling spiders and then finally the balrog were splendid creations every tolkien enthusiast that i knew was anxious to see how the balrog was rendered in the film tolkien himself gave very little description of the creature with the exception that it was winged and that it was of fire and shadow and that it was quite large i dont know one person who was disappointed by the balrog nor by the scene on the bridge of khazad dum again mckellan displayed his brilliant talent and jackson and his team brought the scene to life more than any other in the film for many who had never read the books it was a shock to see the balrogs sword shatter on gandalfs after all for all they knew according to the film that is he was an old man in a battered hat who leaned upon a thorny staff dabbled in fireworks and pipeweed and was inferior to saruman although he was most certainly not that was my biggest personal peeve when the light shone from him like a halo enveloping an angel they saw a small part of who he really was the frustration that i felt when i left the theater was mostly resolved with this extended version after all arwen is still in the movie but the additions that were made one example being the elves singing a lament to gandalf in lothlorien vastly improved the texture of the work and brought it closer to tolkiens intent it needs to be noted that jackson succeeded at something that very few people could have the lord of the rings was be one of the most difficult books to adapt to film and yet he pulled it off disparities notwithstanding im anxiously awaiting the extended version of the return of the king which i should be watching in about three and a half hours i cant wait to review that and talk about how the specific additions theyre making improved that film grin 
set in mythic middle earth a young hobbit named frodo baggins inherits a magic ring from his elderly cousin bilbo the dark lord sauron lusts for the powers that the magic ring holds knowing it will enable him to enslave the people of land in his effort to thwart sauron frodo recruits the fellowship of a wizard an elf a dwarf and others on a mission to destroy the ring by casting it into the volcanic fires in the crack of doom however the ring unleashes its own power as a result of the struggle this movie deserves an a 
this movie is truly a masterpiece you can believe me you should hear it from most people an awesome translation from book to movie peter jackson is brilliant not to mension the person who wrote the book colin thiele who is about ten times more amaising so far this movie beats all other fantasy movies by about so much money was poured into this movie at a great cost the movie includes huge structures amaising acting not one person i think was out of place in the movie fasanating creatures the movie portrayes the feal you have for the book in the best possible way although some parts where cut out i guess they would have had to the costumes were all designed brilliantly just how you would have imagined them in the book and a lot of metal was created just for the movie it includes an awesome soundtrack enough to give you the fealing of doom the biggest attraction to this movie is the scenery it goes from sunny grassy town shires to great forests huge empire buildings elvish lakes and firy pits it is another huge world packed full of orcs goblins humans elves and of course the mighty bellrock possibly the best movie i have ever seen i recommend that you see it you will deffinately not regret it 
i am utterly speechless all my life i have tried to picture what the lord of the rings would look like if it were brought to the big screen some days i envisioned actually directing it myself yet i knew that this was an even farther stretch of the imagination and it would take a great deal more than just dreaming to make it come true when i heard they would be comming out with the lord of the rings to the theatres i groaned and thought to myself that the one thing in the world that hollywood had better pay great respect to it would be these set of books well done peter jackson well done the casting is astounding i could not have thought of a better person for any of the characters i wept when beoromur died i cringed when galadriel transformed into that thing i rejoiced and whooped i clapped when the orc was killed i wanted to hide and close my ears when the ring wraiths appeared it was perhaps the best movie that i have seen in years take a back seat star wars there is a new kid on the block buckle up world middle earth has come to life and we are in for one hell of a ride 
i am writing this for those of you who are turned off by the idea that the film is incomplete and only the first part of a series of three movies consider that when star wars hit the scene and became an instant success no one was complaining that the movie was incomplete and left some cliff hangers that would not be resolved until the second movie was released star wars clever marketing as a return to an old fashion movie serial allowed us to forgive them and so we would have to wait for resolution to plot we waited years before the second movie was released and then another years for episode vi jackson however has done a great service by filming all three films simultaneously so that the second part of the lord of the rings will be released this december and part the following year so dont be dissuaded by going to see the film now i wont repeat all the praises that have already appeared just serve to remind you that december will be here before you know it 
there are not enough words to describe what peter jackson and his team have made to bring to life one of the most amazing stories ever told there are thousands of thoughts impressions reviews and many kinds of things said about tolkiens wonderful story in my opinion his tale is not jus about good and evil but a recreation of the story of christianism where there are martyrs willing to sacrifice symbols to be feared and proteceted at all costs a company of friends almost like apostles making a pilgrimage to a distant land where evil is supreme peter jackson was brilliant choosing to make three movies in one and to film them all at once each part of the lord of the rings has a depth that of its own and to condense the story in only one movie would be a disastrous crime either the story would have to be mutilated or the movie would have to be twelve hours long with three movies there is enough space and time for everything in tolkiens imagination to be brought to life and which is better accurately the visual effects are simply fantastic the balrog being the most amazing one worked on to the last and smallest details new zealand is a wonderful country and the right choice for the photography and photography effects like the famous scene of the two stone figures guarding the entrance of the river the casting was appropriate also a blend of old and proved talented actors and the new generation of stars of medium shine ian mckellen is again superb as gandalf cate blanchett and liv tyler are the beautiful ladies of the elven viggo mortensen and elijah wood do their parts very well mortensen and tyler also learned how to speak the elven tongue for the shooting of the scenes its a shame that the fellowship didnt win the oscar because its a fantasy movie a beautiful mind is very inferior in all aspects 
at last a massive epic action fantasy film that doesnt rest on special effects alone the most inspired aspect of this film is not the locations digital effects or cinematogaphy its actually the casting a truly inspired element that for me has elevated the film into the hall of quot greatest adventure films of all time quot well done peter jackson for choosing actors none of us would have ever considered for the roles and directing them in such a way where timing of dialogue and movement makes the film come alive with intensely human effects in fact the casting is such a perfect match in every case i cannot even imagine anyone else playing these marvellous characters thankfully these films are all shot back to back so were guaranteed the same cast throughout the trilogy especially aragorn legolas boromir and gandalf who bring these roles to life in such passionate detail each actor realizes the story is not just about good and evil it is more about the sweet and righteous corruption of power the quality of these actors most of whom come from the stage allows them to illuminate this dark side of the rings so omnipresent throughout the books yet still maintain our sympathy and interest especially those actors who play boromir and aragon inspiring oops now im repeating myself so ill finish this film deserves six stars 
this movie is amazing when i first saw it i was blown away by it the three hours flew by like five minutes the cinematography acting music script you name it i loved it the two things i will praise mainly are the facts that the characters are almost exactly as i pictured them when i read the book and i admired that the movie shows men being close without being afraid because the books are all about the closeness of these characters this is defentainly one i will buy on dvd 
many fans of tolkiens novels fall in love with the hobbit but seem to have some difficulty reading through the lord of the rings trilogy while tolkien maintains the same style lotr can be a tasking read because it moves more slowly is interjected with many poems songs and adds to the list of names a reader has to keep straight and even though we have all been burned by favorite books being botched on film this is not the case for peter jacksons adaptations of the books in many ways lotr was meant to be put into film the visual addition really helps the books extras gain perspective and if nothing else glorify tolkiens ability to create such a fun scene on paper the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is the first book in the lotr series and is set in the third age of middle earth though the movie begins introducing the significance of the rings created by the dark lord sauron during the second age the rings were divided amongst nine men seven dwarves and three elves but sauron also casted the one ring which holds power over all the others and permitting him control of middle earth sauron was believed to be destroyed when isildur sworded the ring from saurons hand in battle but his life force lives on the movie goes on to explain how the ring came into the possession of bilbo baggins or likewise as bilbo retires the ring becomes frodos but upon gandalf the greys discovery of the ring frodo is dispatched with sam gamgee to remove the ring from the shire while being hunted by the nazgul along the way two other hobbits merry and pippin join their party gandalf then meets saruman the white in isengard saruman betrays gandalf trapping him atop the tower saruman then begins to breed an army once the four hobbits reach bree they encounter the descendent of isidur aragorn who aids them in evading the nazgul though frodo is stuck by a mortal blade arwen and elf princess and old flame of aragorn finds the hobbits and leads them to rivendell where elrond the elf king heals frodos wound in rivendell frodo also encounters the aging bilbo who passes along the sword sting he carrier in the hobbit a freed ganalf joins a council in rivendell where it is decided that the one ring must be destroyed by buring in the place it was forged mount doom those who will carry this burden frodo merry pippin sam aragorn gandalf legolas elf boromir man and gimli dwarf become the fellowship of the ring the remainder of the movie follows the fellowship and gollum through moria onto the elf city of lothlorien and onto parth green possessed by the rings powers boromir frightens frodo into continuing on alone though sam has followed along the two disc widescreen version features the films theatrical version the two towers minute preview cast interviews online content three production documentaries welcome to middle earth the quest for the ring and a passage to middle earth enyas may it be video and more 
the movie is wonderful with excellent sound and picture quality on the transfer the documentaries are a bit repetitive but welcome to middle earth has some great moments with the son of the man who published the books originally the best documentary by far is passage to middle earth so i recommend watching that one first the smaller docs that originally appeared online are also a delight to watch but some of that delight wanes when youre selecting them one after another after another theres no bloody play all option overall this should be the perfect edition for non die hard fans theres plenty here to keep people busy and a lot is learned about the making of the movie if you cant afford or dont have the patience for the extended edition then this is the version for you and its not a bad option at all 
an incredible adventure that captures the imaginations and makes you laugh and cry you will enjoy all the characters and miss them when they are gone and the special effects makes you believe it is all real peter jackson did an amazing job and the cast is perfect a real gem of a movie i think everyone should own it 
 three rings for the elven kings under the sky seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of stone nine for mortal men doomed to die one for the dark lord on his dark throne in the lands of mordor where the shadow lie one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them in the land of mordor where the shadow lie this movie is a must see classic it has great acting except for frodo wonderful story and sweet action this movie is most certainly my favorite movie i have read the book it also is a classic and the movie stays true to the book the thing is though at the end of the movie it jumps from the end of the fellowship of the ring to the begining of the two towers book but it is still easy to follow along the one ring falls in the hands of frodo and gandalf the grey hes a wizzard tells him to bring it to the prancing pony and he will meet them the hobbits pippin merry sam there things dont turn out so well for gandalf and they meet strider aragorn and he starts leading them to rivendell but on the way they meet som trouble they run into the nazugul or ringwriaths beings of darkness clothed all in black they have no visible face there in rivendell the hobbits meet gandalf and the fellowship is created gimli the dwarf legoles the elf gandalf the grey aragorn boromir pippin merry sam and frodo from there they try to go over some mountains but saruman who betrayes the good side tries to bring down the mountain that doesnt work so the fellowship goes through the mines of moria in balins tomb inside moria they meet some orcs there is a ferousios battle between many orcs and the fellowship it has to be the best battle scene in the movie then they get overwhelmed by too many orcs and they flee then a couple thousand orcs surrond them but get scared by a demon from the shadow a balrog gandalf and the balrog have a showdown and gandalf wins well sort of the balrog pulls him down into the shadows with him gandalf falls and the fellowship flees then they meet up with the kind elves in lorien then head towards mordor which is where they need to go to destroy the ring by going down the great river they hit the banks and are attacked by orcs the fellowship is broken here and sam and frodo go on thier own towards mordor to destroy the ring boromir falls trying to protect the other two hobbits and the hobbits get captured aragorn gimli and legolas go after the orcs to get back merry and pippin the hobbits that is where the movie ends it is a great five star masterpiece and a must see no movie collection is complete without it im sure we all thank peter jackson for this wonderful movie 
having just seen the film i can highly recommend this movie to all fans of tolkien and fantasy films alike the film remained highly true to both the books and illustrations of tolkien while taking some artistic license for the sake of viewability but not much visually almost all of the film is stunning majestic and highly memorable it also helps bring certain elements of the books to life that i personally had overlooked or forgotten for example the transformation of sarumans tower from majestic to horrific through the destruction of the terrain and smelting casting for lord of the rings was excellent christopher lee as saruman was a brilliant selection as were those cast for other major parts including the hobbits especially frodo gandalf gimli and legolas there were some elements missing from the books that probably should have been in the movie one of which is the exchange between strider and the innkeeper who only remembers his name because people shout it at him all day long another element that seems to be missing is the change in attitudes between gimli and legolas as they go from being natural enemies to the most unusual of friends through the trials they face in the fellowship of the ringbearer this element seems sadly overlooked other elements that were written out were probably due to time constraints and are wholly understandable after all the film is three hours families may be intimidated to take small children as this is a rather long story some of the gore is unsuitable for younger viewers including but not limited to intense scenes violent swordfights including decapitations and horrific elements that could give children nightmares older children will enjoy this film and the depiction of a struggle of good against evil is not marred by the use of adult language or sexual scenes making this film relatively tame considering its pg rating visually this film is more in the classification of quot crouching tiger hidden dragon quot as opposed to quot star wars phantom menace quot which is what everyone apparently wants to compare it to it lacks the speed and pace of a star wars movie and is much more in keeping with the feel of epic sweeping fantasy like quot crouching tiger quot one nice comment is that the film does not use either bullet time photography or martial arts something that has become quite popular since the advent of the matrix the movie is true to the period depicted definitely recommended 
i went to see the fellowship of the rings and i was blown away by the story and visual effects i couldnt wait for it to come out on dvd so that i could own it so i bought the theatrical release being the non patient sort that i am i should have waited for this one the added bits to the story are important and they dont seem to increase the length of the movie like some directors cuts do they are melded seamlessly into the movie and improve the flow of the movie its too bad that movie studios dont like it when movies get too long because this is the version that should have been released in the theater when two towers comes out im not even going to bother with the theatrical release ill just wait for the extended edition 
my largest complaint about the original release of tfotr was that it was obviously created by a horror movie director other than the shire and rivendell everything beautiful was cut and minimized and way too much time was spent showing uruk hai crawling in the mud it lost way too much of the magic of middle earth galadriel seemed vile lothlorien was a chilling uncomfortable place very unlike the world tolkien wrote about but the extended version does much to rectify this the added scenes show the charm of the characters they show the beauty and warmth of lothlorien and galadriel and there is no reason any of these scenes should have been cut to begin with if i were trying to cut the length of this movie id hack out unnecessary scenes that had nothing to do with the plot such as the moria staircase scene or the pep talk to lurtz scene the added scenes are far more important to the development of the plot characters and world of middle earth than other scenes that peter jackson was obviously just more attached to as a horror movie director not trying to badmouth p j he did a really great difficult job overall and in the end he did put together this very nice extended version this extended cut is very natural the added footage isnt just stuck in there like some extended movies ive seen it is sewn into the tapestry of the film and new dialog and music add to the film as well not just minutes longer but truly minutes better 
now that the inevitable hype upon its initial release has subsided the time is right to properly appreciate and marvel at director peter jacksons classic masterpiece for masterpiece it most certainly is and my personal hope is simply that the forthcoming sequels live up to what has gone before firstly however it is pertinent to dissect the various criticisms that have been levelled at the film from some uninformed quarters to slavishly emulate jrr tolkiens original work would be virtually impossible the book is far too detailed to allow such an undertaking but what has been delivered is a superb adaptation that maintains the sprit of the original publication indeed the original novel suffered from more than its fair share of padding and the removal of sojourns such as the groups meeting with tom bombadil do not detract from the overall tale the screenplay in presenting the story does indulge in poetic licence but within the parameters of the overall theme so to those who moan its not like the book use a little commonsense eh likewise the anti climatic ending anyone with even a modicum of intelligence will appreciate that this is part one of a trilogy an ongoing story so if youre more disposed to a crash bang wallop finite ending then youre probably better off watching the latest arnie release yes it certainly leaves the viewer hankering as to know what transpires next but all will be revealed in decembers forthcoming the two towers and finally as to the whole star wars vs lotr debate for my money there really is no comparison effects wise star wars may have been ahead of its time on original release but please take just a moment to consider the simplistic storyline and shallow characterisation before even contemplating the remote possibility it could compare on any level with lotr so what is it all about at the beginning of time nine magical rings are forged that bestow upon the various races within middle earth the power by which to rule but a further secret ring is also forged by the dark lord sauron that has the power to bind all nine together and thereby plunge middle earth into a future of darkness and despair under his domination fate decrees that a young hobbit frodo baggins eventually inherits this magical ring and who then undertakes to destroy it and therefore eternal darkness once and for all within the fires of mount doom the place it was originally forged and the only location where it might be destroyed so begins his perilous journey from within the comfortable safety of the shire to the evil domain of mordor assisted by a motley collection of fellow hobbits elves dwarves and gandalf the wizard all the while insatiably pursued by the terrifying agents of sauron so the adventure begins as we witness the intrepid band on their journey and all that they encounter on their way to the outskirts of mordor wherein the ring must eventually be destroyed ian mckellen is absolutely outstanding as gandalf the wizard the personification of the paternal grandfather wed all like the focal point of wisdom and guidance and his omission from the recent oscar winners was a grave misjudgement of the academys behalf all round the casting is inspired but it is slightly disappointing that both liv tyler and cate blanchetts contributions are little more than cameo roles this should be resolved however in the sequels the imagery is breathtakingly stunning and the choice of location principally new zealand genuinely inspired wonder in awe as the camera sweeps into the depths of the mines thousands of feet deep or soars above the glorious landscapes and the obligatory special effects are the pinnacle of the art at three hours duration the film may appear lengthy but i for one remained absolutely captivated throughout and i defy anyone with a smidgeon of imagination not to be enthralled likewise faultless save for a few of those annoying humorous interjections hollywood seems unable to resist entwining into plots lord of the rings is simply a thoroughbred classic in the real sense 
i think this is one of the best movies ever its definitely my favorite of the lord of the rings trilogy this dvd limited edition is amazing there are tons of great extras i usually never watch the extras on movies b c i usually just dont care this is a different story the effort that went into making this masterpiece is mind blowing there are extensive interviews with the director about the location selection and cast selection its awesome to watch the making of this colossal movie if ou are going to buy this movie the limited edition is probably the best way to do it 
if you want a non tolkien fans response to quot fellowship of the ring quot fotr look no further if you are anything like me you have long heard of j r r tolkiens tales of fantasy and magic but youve never developed an interest in reading them as it turns out reading the book is probably not a good idea before seeing this movie as you can see the other reviewers who have read the book complain about the film omitting this scene or that little tidbit found in the book they generally give the film good marks but these nagging omissions are ever present for them i was not labored with this knowledge as most people know film is a different medium than literature you can take two chapters to describe the local scenery in a book but you cant spend an inordinate amount of screen time on scenery or the audience gets bored that is why it is a mistake i think to compare this film to the book treat them as individual pieces of work respect them as such and you will not have a problem as someone whose knowledge of elves orcs and wizards was confined to the pages of dungeons and dragons books which i believe was inspired by tolkiens novels i had a familiarity with the kind of world quot fotr quot would offer however i was not prepared at all for the way this film grabbed me the basic story involves a hobbit named frodo who is entrusted with a golden ring that has the power of pure evil in it the one ring has corrupted many souls in its long life and frodos quest is to keep the ring safe and out of the hands of the monsterous beings seeking it out after all the fate of the world depends upon him protecting the ring if the ring falls into evil hands only death will follow this is no cheesy fairy tale this is a story with teeth big nasty sharp teeth with fangs that will strike at any moment it is sweeping in scope frightening in its tone and the hours fly by like you would not believe you will care deeply for frodo and the other characters as they face incredible dangers deal with hidden temptations and struggle to fend off the powerful forces of evil you will feel the fourth wall melt before you as you are literally transported into middle earth with the characters and with every setback with every failure and with every misstep you will feel like you are taking it with them it is a stirring film of immense grandeur and spectacle and i recommend this film like none i have seen in quite some time it is an epic the likes of which has never been done so successfully before and i cannot wait for the next film to be released 
now that i have all three extended editions i will go as far as to say the fellowship of the ring is my favorite entry into the lord of the rings movie trilogy it is obviously not to discredit the other two films by any means the return of the king is extremely comparable in emotional content and comes a close second the two towers is exremely important to the story and its exhaustive production merits its support however the fotr seems more entertaining and is full of wonderful cinematic expression we see a story and character development that has few rivals it is important to be welcomed to the characters properly and all are introduced well under peter jacksons direction as well as fran peter and philippas careful script handling not to mention the additional scenes are the most poignant or necessary of all three ee dvds as it goes without saying the extra features for the dvd were and still are absolutely amazing to behold in quantity and quality any relevant or trivial facts about the filming of fotr are crammed into two supplementary discs in addition to the two discs containing the actual extended film four seperate commentary tracks complement the movie itself the absolutely vital stuff is covered by pete fran and philipa and they are actually fun to listen to and can have a laugh about their work the in depth production work behind the scenes span the next two tracks with multiple people responsible for the work the cast of fotr share the last track and is a favorite the hobbits have fun remembering the process and enjoy a joke or two the two wizards ian mckellen and christopher lee are more punctuated on how they tried to interpret their roles for the movie the video and audio are on par with the best demo reference material this dvd is what home theater systems were made for hardly a video artifact to find the colors are bright where they need to be and somber where they need but all of it is clear and sharp and may i add of all the trilogy fotr uses a more expansive pallette than tt and rotk glorious hobbiton pastures contrast dark bleached mines of moria the sound is awesome and should be taken advantage of your subwoofer will beg for mercy when sauron explodes in the beginning prologue dialog is crisp and of course the music by howard shore demands your attention the real highlight of the ee dvd are of course the two appendice discs as if the film itself isnt long enough youll spend hours pouring through the extras two or three sittings may be required by some the extras just may make some appreciate the work put in by the production crew and cast granted a generous budget made it possible but it makes me proud to know weta did not waste any of it by any means of the imagination anjd this is true of the whole trilogy not just fotr for under it is a must have the trilogy is maybe a cornerstone of film history and fotr is in my opinion the flagship of the series and remember the other two dvds are equally impressive productions to have as well 
i personally think that lord of the rings is the best adventure story of all time when you watch this movie it makes you think your in another world this is what great adventure movies are supposed to do the storyline of the lotr is quite complicated but here is a simple version a hobbit named frodo comes across a ring of extrodinary power which a dark lord sauron wants to find to enslave different species if not all the only way to destroy the ring is to throw it into the fires in which it was created the problem is that the fires are in the heartland of the dark lord saurons territory how could a movie with a plot like this possibly be bad i know of some action fans who dont like this movie but never fear the two towers succesfully has more action but with just as much adventure before seeing this movie i didnt know much about lotr but after ive become a huge fan so overall great movie 
i dont care what other people think lord of the rings should have won best picture not a beautiful mind beautiful what the lord of the rings was an excellent movie in all aspects it didnt fail in music scenary acting script or plot the movie was long and that made it better i dont understand why directors think they can make a good action film in an hour and a half it just wont work i love adventure movies and movies that take place back in time before i saw this movie i havent seen a really good adventure movie in a long time so this was really enjoyable i recommend it its a masterpiece 
when the the fellowship of the ring came out in theaters i greeted its arrival with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation i love the books and i was hoping that the films would not underachieve and do an injustice to tolkiens vision as the earlier animated film had done when the galadrial narration began i knew that there was nothing to worry about the opening battle sequences were phenominal but it was something else that convinced me that these movies were something special later in the opening as gandalf and frodo rode into the shire and the hobbitt children accosted them wanting fireworks the images on the screen brought tears to my eyes later as the black riders attack frodo their screams were bone chilling and fear inspiring this was tolkien realized perfectly while some parts of the book have been omitted overall the the fellowship of the ring is an excellent movie peter jackson was excellent in his direction what also stands out in this movie is the excellent performances by the cast ian mckellans gandalf was perfect capturing the right mixture of compassion wry humor and strength that the wizard needed i found the performances of elijah wood and sean astin as frodo and sam to be the most compelling in this first film viggo mortenson captures dead on the majesty of the exiled hidden heir of gondor orlando bloom is fine as legolas john rys davies is able to inject a perfect mixture of petulance and bravery in gimli christopher lees saruman is the perfect evil foil for the fellowship dominic monaghan and billy boyd first begin to shine as merry and pippin and bring some humor to the film finally sean beans boromir is perfectly cast he embodies the arrogance courage despair and strength of the son of gondor when he is killed giving up his life for his friends it is one of the most powerful moments in the film on par with gandalfs sacrifice against the balrog in a film that astounds with its imagery and sound whose story is legendary it is the ability of peter jackson to capture the human themes of the story that make the fellowship of the ring and the lord of the rings trilogy such a remarkable series of films the fact that a film as original and ground breaking as the the fellowship of the ring did not win best picture and best director is proof of the idiocy of hollywood 
with the many many reviews written concerning this movie there is little for me to add i saw the movie in the theatre but being deaf had to wait until this came out for me to really enjoy it i read the trilogy four times when i was younger they could not have done a much better job bringing this to screen and i can hardly wait until the next part of the trilogy thank heavens peter jackson had the intelligence to wait until the technology was such that he could make lord of the rings as it is written mckellen as gandalf is superb elijah wood has an unbelieveably poignant face and mannerism i never thought much of him as a child actor but then maybe it was the choice of scripts he got and the directors his sadness at having to do such a hard task alone is enough to break your heart again those of us with hearing loss enjoy films best when they are in letterbox format the captioning that we need is then not interfering with the beauty and plot on the screen i plan to wait until all three movies are out and then i will get the boxed version with all the outtakes one thing i must bring attention to is for once all the outtakes the specials etc are captioned so i can enjoy them with my hearing family members i really wish members of the directors and film communities would figure out that captioning of all parts of the dvds make it worth while for us deafies to buy the blasted things i was horribly disappointed with the grinch since only the film itself was captioned i still maintain if a beautiful mind had not been in the running lord of the rings would have won much more at the oscars a truly beautiful movie karen sadler
well the movie has definitely lived up to the hype prepare yourself for a cinematic feast a true ensemble cast fantastic adaptation unbelievable score cinematography to die for eye candy for special effects the list goes on and on if it doesnt garner at least oscars it will have been robbed i am running out of superlatives it was that good hours is a long film but it really doesnt seem that long the only thing missing is tom bombadil for some reason everryone cuts him out ah well it is a must see at least times on the big screen and dont settle for pan amp scan on video either 
i think that peter jackson deserves all the cudos he can garner for these films casting was amazing every character completely believable and perfect for the part the scenery was absolutely beautiful and perfectly filmed i was amazed at jacksons succesful attempt to stay true to the original story true some prime characters were left out and i did miss the return to the shire and finding men had taken over but for the conventions of movie making some things must fall by the wayside and i think jackson did a supurb job weeding out what little he did all three of these films are high on my list of watch again cant give them a high enough rating 
i couldnt have asked for a better onscreen presentation of this wonderful book there are a few changes only a few that were made to give the movie a little more continuity but for the most part its perfect the cgs are very well done not only are they well crafted they are well placed not overusing technology just because you have it the acting is wonderful and the photography is breathtaking i cant wait for the next two movies 
i am one of those people who has read quot the lord of the rings quot trilogy at least once a year for more than thirty years i consider it the greatest work of literature of the twentieth century the writing shows an complicated world and makes you believe it is so real it could be history the movie series is incredibly good it is completely true to the central themes of the book trilogy and can be completely enjoyed by someone who has not read the books the special effects and capture of scale for the foot and under hobbits with tall men elves and dwarves are visually stunning some liberties were taken with the book and some of the characters are changed considerably arwen but the story is very true to the central themes the trilogy of movies will become the standard of comparison for future entertainment the richness of middle earth is captured in the movie the effects come close to what you see with the minds eye and that is high praisethis was a set of movies made by someone peter jackson who loved the books and wanted to bring them to the screen in a way that was worthy of j r r tolkien if you like a good story with good special effects get all three of these as soon as they are available get the expanded edition and see the story as envisioned not shortened for theatrical release a hour movie makes sense on dvd where it would not in a theatre the quot how we did this effect quot sections are quite entertaining as well 
having read and highly enjoyed the books i was eager to see the movie when it first arrived in theaters and it did not disappoint the theatrical release of this first installment of the famous quot lord of the rings quot trilogy was everything i had expected and more jackson added his own touches while still managing to remain remarkably faithful to the books no easy task when this extended edition came out i was first to pounce on it and the impossible occurred it was even better than the original release so much was added it was phenomenal mostly its just thirty seconds here a couple of minutes there though there are some quite heavily extended portions as well but even the tiny things added so much color and life to this already brilliant piece of cinematic art i couldnt help thinking quot ack how could they ever have left this out quot it is an absolutely incredible piece i was immensely impressed the other thing i highly enjoyed was all the extras on the other two disks the secrets behind the effects and the making of the film itself it was fascinating to see the inner workers of this movie i loved every one of them i sat there for hours just watching the entire thing reveling in the mysteries of film making and marveling that someone could be that clever and faithful to their project you really learn to appreciate the awesome amount of work that went into this film after seeing this one i dont think ill ever be able to watch the original theatrical release again 
this was a gift for a family member and they loved it i also enjoyed it as well thank you very much 
what can i say that hasnt already been said full complete character portrayals beautifully filmed a classic and a treasure 
given the major competition that is out there for the lord of the rings i think it is helpful to point out those who have not read the trilogy will fare much better watching the fellowship of the ring than those who are uninitiated watching harry potter and the sorcerers stone in fact this may well be one of those movies where the novices will enjoy it more than those soaked in hobbit lore and the history of the rings elijah wood is a credible frodo although there are almost as many shots of him looking worried about what is happening as there are close ups of the ring i might be able to recognize the skin patterns on woods hand in my sleep ian mckellen as would be expected makes the most of playing gandalf the grey bringing a most human dimension to the role while avoiding chewing the scenery except for those moments when the wizard unleashes the full force of his power cate blanchett is a rather cold galadriel missing the spark that should take our breath away just looking at her but ultimately the performances are almost incidental to the rest of what is happening in this film while much is to be said for the stunning set designs of which the mines of moria stand out even above the elven havens of rivendell and lothlorien equal measure must be given to the enchanted new zealand landscapes the visual spectacles hinted at in the trailers are revealed in all their glory throughout the entire film the fight sequences hold up well against the current contemporary standard albeit without any wire work surprisingly with all the swordplay involved it is legolas with his bow and arrows that stands out during every single battle the orcs are suitable horrendous and numerous and the balrog certainly exceeded my expectations but what really makes this film work is that the hobbits seem hobbit size and after the first time you see frodo and gandalf together you never give it a second thought in terms of the controversies that exist i think omitting tom bombadil was a wise editing move the film is almost three hours long as it stands and there are plenty of other characters in the tale who refuse to take up the ring and the burden from frodo and buffing up arwens role does not bother me a bit tolkiens world is clearly male dominated the lady galadriel and eowyn being relatively minor figures in the tale despite their respective powers and i can appreciate the idea that arwen should be more than the elf babe who shows up and marries the king at the end now she will be a worthy consort who offers the hero encouragement and support along his journey i have more second thoughts about merry and pippin being more so the comic relief than sam than i would either of those overall the movie is extremely faithful to tolkiens vision the door to moria is just as it appears in the book down to the proportions the maps the elvish runes the lettering on the letter are all precisely and perfectly rendered even more importantly the key lines are all preserved from i will take the ring though i do not know the way to fly you fool 
i fell in love with the books as a child and have seen the cartoon version but this is much better they did a great job following the books as a whole rather than as each individual book good acting and well directed i love the cinematography beautiful sets 
the lord of the rings is my favorite story i have the books of course and a lot of figures and even an audio version that i never listen to when i saw the prior lotr movie the animated one i was extremely disappointed it didnt do the movie justice its hard to satisfy an audience that adores the book any deviation from the book is a negative and there are a few deviations from the book it cant possibly live up to the impact the book had on you but this movie comes reasonably close to putting the book on film i would have made a few changes but peter jackson somehow never asked me to give my opinion one change i would have made remember the scene where the four hobbits in the shire are hiding from a black rider whose horse is sniffing around right near them i would have made that scene a lot scarier i would have made you feel the tension and fear a lot more that is supposed to really set up for the viewer what is at stake here and they failed to do that the hobbits nonchalanted it too much they also could have helped by using music or sound of some kind to scare the bejesus out of you that scene required that kind of treatment i also would have differentiated merry and pippin more from each other while it is true that we got the point that pippin was the meatball of the two merrys maturity didnt show at all and they physically resembled each other far far too much merry was supposed to be the toughest of the four hobbits despite his merry name and he should have been given a personality of his own rather than just playing the role of the utterly unimportant of the four hobbits i loved what they did with sams hobbit girlfriend in the shire she was so adorable strong and free exactly what the movie needed she gives us a reason to love the hobbits the movie actually did a lot better than the book than tolkein himself did at fleshing out the character of rosie sams girl it is a shame that time constraints apparently forced peter jackson to leave tom bombadil out of the movie altogether bombadil and goldberry are wonderful tolkein characters and this story isnt complete without them in the book didnt the chase scene between the black riders and frodo play out differently i dont think that in the book arwen saves frodos hash when she races towards rivendell with an unconscious frodo draped over her horse doesnt frodo stand up to the black riders himself rather than being carried like a sack of potatoes i suppose peter jackson made a decision to give arwen and liv tyler a more heroic role having her save frodo it emasculates frodo though because it doesnt allow us to see him take charge of a battle scene and stand up to the black riders himself which as i mentioned before should have been set up better by making those villains more terrifying how many chances did frodo have to do a battle scene with fearsome enemies hes usually just bearing the ring and keeping sam and gollum from killing each other i think his most macho hero scene was taken from him and given to arwen the problem is i have seen the movie a few times its been years since i read the book and im not sure that arwen didnt save frodo did she or didnt she i would have cast or directed elrond differently in the book he was an elf lord of immense power and interest but in the movie he really didnt come across nearly as powerfully he seemed a bit like a minor general and a has been and tolkein didnt paint him that way i prefer him more powerful we also dont really see the transition for gimli in the movie from despising elves to loving galadriel i dont think it would have been that hard to make us see his transformation better the version of galadriel that i saw in my minds eye from the book was gentler softer prettier less dangerous looking than the one on screen and a lot more likely to provoke adoration in a mans heart the battle scenes particularly in the mines against the hordes of orcs come off a bit phony because they make you wonder how so many orcs can be killed while not one casualty is suffered by the fellowship at the hands of the orcs of course we are constrained by tolkeins writing and after all the orcs failed to seriously wound any of the fellowship but if i had directed this movie i would have done something about that to bring a little more realism to the scene make it less of a good guys always win and never get hurt conclusion to the orc battle i didnt picture saruman as christopher lee i pictured him as a shorter and shiftier man a sweet talking salesman type with shifty eyes in the movie he resembled gandalf too much one gandalf is enough i pictured him as a short overweight shifty and treacherous man capable of being cowardly towards sauron bullying towards weaker foes and shifty in his dealings with gandalf seeming to be a degraded wizard who still has a lot of tricks up his sleeve peter overplayed the physical power of the elves making them just as large as men when it was important to make them no more than about feet tall and very thin the orcs too should have been elf size gimli should clearly have been a hell of a lot more powerful than legolas but the way the movie was done legolas was the big strong one and gimli was of slight importance this is a fantasy and they should have gone to the trouble of shrinking the elves and orcs making sarumans orcs almost man sized all things considered this movie does do justice to the book its a wonderful movie thanks peter for a job extremely well done 
i just received my lotr dvd gift set and it is just wonderful i love the added minutes it really fleshes out the story filling in details that were missed in the original theatrical release the bookends are weighty and i cant wait to watch the national geographic dvd included with it my only slight concern is that the box label states theres a free ticket to see quot the two towers quot but the ticket coupon expired at the end of dont let this keep you from getting the set but if you were looking forward to a free screening of quot two towers quot that time has passed 
after i saw this movie it really did leave me wanting more though its just under hrs it is perfectly paces it contains good battles and alot of visuals the reason i compare it to harry potter and the sorcerors stone is that they came out around the same time theyre both fantasy films i saw them both and are both based off of books i thought the harry potter movie was really good until i saw fellowship of the rings this movie im serious is xs better then harry potter its just so beautiful and the actings good and everything is really good the harry potter movie was good but it just doesnt hook me like this lotr did i never read the books either but ive read the harry potter books my bros have read the hobbit and lord of the rings trilogy and my bro really didnt notice much difference from the book and the movie one noticable difference is the character of arwen which is a male in the book not a female whereas harry potter was changed quite a bit but still remained pretty loyal to the book harry potter is more for kiddies whereas lotr is more for whover i duno if little kids could really sit through it or if it would be wise since there some pretty gory scenes in battle but for me it was hands down the best fantasy film i ever saw and now one of my favorite movies go see it and enjoy it its worth the movie totally god bless 
lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring was a powerhouse of an ensemble film featuring an all star cast fantastically detailed sets an almost insane attention to detail and gorgeous cinematography its no wonder that while only released in it immediately vaulted to the spot on the new afi top listing while other classics like doctor zhivago dropped off the list completely i should caveat first that i grew up reading and adoring the lord of the rings trilogy i re read it probably once a year i absolutely adored aragorn and all of my daydreams were about me as aragorns loyal companion in the books you see arwen hardly appears shes a footnote in an appendix this first book is all about men men and more men i suppose galadriel shows up at one point to pass around presents but thats about it so when i went to see the film it was almost a religious experience the weathertop scene where the hobbits are calling out strider in panic had me shiver these were my dreams coming to life the attention the weta workshop put into every scene is legendary they literally had the book open and were reading the pages to know what to do they hand carved proper dwarvish ruins along all surfaces of the caves in the mines of moria viggo learned to speak elvish and lobbied for more dialogue in the language they tended to the gardens at hobbiton for a full year so it had a lived in look yes they had to cut out some of the book heck the movie was already hours long i do not mind that at all and i also do not mind that they gave arwen a part up until now we had one female that was it one i realize the book was written in the dark ages of but still surely there could be more females involved even with the two whole females in the movie they never even interact they are both there solely to be foils to the menfolk still one cannot blame jackson at all for that the responsibility for that goes back to j r r tolkien some purists were already upset enough that arwen got to speak in the movie i imagine a hostile rage would have erupted if more than that occurred so absolutely i adore lord of the rings and i own all the different versions on dvd i highly recommend watching it it is glorious in its own right and so much of what it shows and says has infiltrated its way into modern culture watching tv reading novels or going to movies can often involve an expectation that you get the references involved 
great price very pleased with purchase and would highly recommend to anyone as you can see im a movie buff and this this is a great movie 
this movie is great the acting story characters special effects everything i highly recommend this movie to anyone watch it i know you will love it 
peter jackson captures both your heart and your imagination with the film version of lord of the rings the first in a series of three films which promises to bring the j r tolkien classic to life on the screen lotr was the foundation for me in a lifetime of love affairs with books first read in at the age of it changed my tastes from childhood readings to adult fare it swept me up in the powerful imagery of tolkiens vivid vision of an alternate world i fretted all year at the thought of the film and was pleased at the choice of director and that no stars with names that are household words were to be featured in the roles i could not resist seeing the film on day and in all hours i was captivated by the screen i attended with a friend who had never read lotr and was able to realize how well jackson has succeeded in helping the film exceed expectations of lifelong tolkien fans as well as introducing the epic to those who are unfamiliar with the story the cinematography and special effects are quietly brilliant the use of the unspoiled territory of new zealand was a marvelous choice the shire is particularly well captured in the film as is the lair of saruman who is chilling in his role of a brilliant genius turned evil possibly his best techniques of the many used in the film was the way he conveyed the evil lust that overcomes those who are tempted by the power that possession of the ring entails seeing bilbo baromir and galadriel all succumb to the need for the ring through the eyes of gandalf and frodo was chilling and better conveyed visually here than in the book jackson does not let the special effects overwhelm your sense of story much as lucas did in the first star wars trilogy the music is perfectly adapted to both story and cinematography and was a highlight of the film for me jackson captured the spirit of the story the teamwork and love that grows between comrades faced with insurmountable odds in particular he makes the odd looking frodo elijah wood very slowly into the character that many noble men and women will place their trust in frodo and samwise sean astin excellent in his role friendship is real and transcends the screen the larger than life roles of gandalf and aragon strider ian mckellan and viggo mortensen were well cast and memorable both actors became their roles and both captured the sense of honor that those who protect the endangered hobbits on their noble quest must have mckellan particularly although nominated for a supporting actor role made gandalf his own heres a role that could not be recast successfully again mckellan is the ultimate gandalf jackson has succeeded in directing successful characterization on the screen and sacrificing some bit players from the book to the texture of the main plot there is no question that this film succeeds on the level of epics and we are fortunate in this decade to be able to keep it alongside crouching tiger while waiting for the saga to continue to unfold bravo 
peter jackson had a good idea when he relased the special extended edition of the fellowship of the ring some of the additional scenes make the movie more compelling for instance frodo and sam watch a group of elves go off into the after life and sam feels sadness in watching this also the scene that shows merry and pippin fighting the urak hai spelling alongside boromir before he is pierced by three arrows is more compelling in the original theatrical release theyre just standing there watching him die making it look like theyre cowards so i was glad to see this footage added to that combat scene finally the hours of additional background information provided in discs three and four give you an appreciation for what peter jackson and his crew had to do to bring this storyline to the big screen in summary the special extended edition of fellowship of the ring is first rate and i hope this carries over to the other movies when theyre released on dvd 
do i rely need to say anything about these films lol they all are just epic adventures to me i love these so much the action acting is on point in all so dont miss out on any all must be owned watched even tho they super lonnnggggg films omg longest movies ive ever watched amz has all very very cheap xmas time is good time to get them here etc on a super sale blu ray ever ha
it is more engaging and less likely to bore the viewer sadly in cutting the film down to a length more suited to the theater jackson eliminated so much humor most of all detail and story that it editing it must have been a heartbreak for him thankfully with the dvd edition we get to see his complete vision one down note the dvd rom features are not available for the macintosh this is a rather stupid oversight particularly given the prevalent use of macs by creative people who might be drawn to the art and techniques behind the making of this film it would be great to have an explanation for this flaw 
rarely do you run into a dvd version of a movie of this level peter jackson set out to provide fans of lotr with a treasure to keep for life with an extended version of the movie provided in two of the four discs that thoroughly complements the story we saw in the theaters but it was no mere putting the deleted scenes back in the added material was the result of uncovering a whole additional layer of footage that was left out for time reasons but with the same quality of the rest of the movie just having been edited out because it was not critical for the purposes of telling the story yet id argue that it complements it in such a way that i cant conceive the movie without these moments now as for the features then again the movie lent itself to a very broad array of things to share unlike a star wars episode where most of the action took place in the digital world lotr had a bit of everything that it made use of shots in the open leveraging the beauty of new zealand live action in full size sets detail shots of miniatures cg characters thrown into real sets virtual sets with real actors virtual characters in virtual sets and even a virtual camera in a virtual set where real actors would be superimposed the fight of the fellowship against the cave troll in moria theres a wealthy and health mix of technology and art in the movie in a way that maintains a balance that can satisfy all tastes plus theres all the culture of each of the races of middle earth poured into all the components that make up the story garments armor weapons makeup architecture etc to materialize this infinitely rich tapestry that tolkien wove with his words some five decades ago all of this is shared with the viewer in generous detail to satisfy even the most demanding lotr fan i am now on to quot the two towers platinum series special extended edition quot and you 
 the fellowship of the ring is the first of the lord of the rings trilogy and i would recommend that you watch them in order in this movie we see the origin of the one ring and how it comes into frodos possession we see the formation and breaking of the fellowship this movie will introduce you to middle earth there are breathtaking scenes in the movie when the camera pans around and captures the beautiful settings of middle earth peter jackson did a great job in envisioning the realm and choosing the location for it we first see hobbiton where the houses have flower patches and old fences the roads look worn and made through decades of travel and the old mill spins with the laziness of a quiet town it made me believe i was there and his wonderful creations that we get to explore with the fellowship rivendale the halls of moria lothlorien and the passage down the anduin it lets us see the vast living world that is middle earth tolkiens work is not faithfully followed certain characters are missing as are some songs that are memorable from the book but the movie does not let us down and it is a good screen adaptation i love that the elvish language that tolkien created is spoken and the casting is excellent this is much better than the original release the movie has an extra minutes added which will help you flow easier to the second film and the great bonuses included in this package include the making of the film interviews with all the stars drawings and interviews with peter jackson and the rest of the people responsible for producing this classic as well as a good look at where the film was shot in new zealand behind the scenes stories and incidents that happened during the filming this is the dvd to buy 
can i say something else about this film i dont think so anyway the point of this review is the dvd of the film and this delivers big time wonderful package and a great presence in your shelf 
it is humbling to try and think out a review of this film when i last looked there were some reviews posted and no doubt many more coming what can i say that has not been said before and probably better than i can all this for the momentary honor of having reviewed something that has touched me deeply think reviews and the overall rating is stars what an astounding accomplishment what more evidence does any need that this is something to treasure i actually avoided this film when it first came out because i could not believe that it would measure up to the lord of the rings that lives in my mind after years of reading and rereading nor was i sure that i was comfortable sharing in a theater what had become an intensely personal experience alas this was my loss at least in this modern era i can have that experience via this most excellent dvd along with countless pieces of information on the making of the film i was in high school when i first read these books but it was not until years later when the paperbacks came out that the ring began to work its magic on me years later the film has renewed that experience what is great about this film is not that it is a reasonably faithful rendering of the books or that actors bring their characters to life beautifully although both these statements are true what is great about this film is that is captures the intent of tolkiens story which was far more than the telling of an incredible task when the ring first appeared in paperback it came into the hands of a generation of people who desperately needed a legend of their own in a world gone crass and commercial where people were being bent by an inexplicable conflict the lord of the rings promised that if we were willing to pay the price the balance could be restored that the source of good was truly just as inexhaustible as that of evil forty years later this film succeeds in recreating that lesson and restoring that image if peter jackson had to turn and twist things in order to keep this film within reasonable viewing bounds he left out nothing important i missed tom bombadil and the barrow downs and sauron and arwen have considerably extended parts but what jackson has done is put a great deal of effort into making sure that what he did do felt right in many cases his imagery was far in excess of the product of my poor and worn out brains as such this is a film for which to be grateful for me this is a great gift a fond memory revisited 
this film was one of the greatest movies ive seen pure entertainment i never read the books so i wasnt sure what this film was really going to be about besides the ring but this film was escellent i was kind of dissapointed when my favorite character died but other than that i loved the movie and i think im hooked as soon as this film gets put on dvd ill be the first to buy it must see movie and as the oscars showed lord of the rings is truley great 
if you thought the fellowship of the ring theatrical version was wonderful wait until you see this i love j r r tolkiens books and the movie is one of my favorite films of all time but this special extended edition is even better more character development more humor more references to the book and more backstory the great thing about this version is that instead of tacking in irrelevant deleted scenes to the dvd the scenes were completely integrated into the original version of the movie with additional music composed by howard shore what you get is a much fuller and more fulfilling version of the film and changes the focus from being frodo centric to a layered story of middle earth and its creatures there are sprinklings of added footage all over the film sometimes if you blink youll actually miss it everyone in the fellowship has added scenes but the characters who receive the biggest boost are aragorn viggo mortensen and galadriel cate blanchett you see more of aragorns backstory as well as a warmer more endearing side to his character while galadriel appeared fearsome and grave in the original version the elven queen is kindly and compassionate in this one my favorite new scenes are the hobbit heroes in the green dragon inn having fun and a good brew with their fellow hobbits new characters such as gaffer gamgee and ted sandyman are also introduced elrond and aragorn in gilraens aragorns mothers grave and a warm and endearing scene in lothlorien with gimli and galadriel as well as aragorn and galadriel of all the locations the shire and lothlorien get the biggest boost the gift giving scene is back in and we see and hear more of lord celeborn marton csokas and haldir all this and we havent even began to look at the fantastic extra features and documentaries there are too many to mention hours of extras in fact i would suggest that you take in these behind the scenes documentaries a handful at a time as there is a lot of information to absorb my favorites are the features the fellowship of the cast a day in the life of a hobbit and cameras of middle earth in disk they show loads of cast and crew interviews many of them candid and funny esp those with dom monaghan viggo sean bean and billy boyd as well as informative and sometimes hilarious behind the scenes footage and dont forget to locate the easter eggs as well the mtv movie awards spoof of the council of elrond and the fan trailer of the two towers if you plan to own only one dvd this year and especially if you are a lord of the rings fan you must get your hands on this dvd it is an absolute gem even if you own the theatrical version of the fellowship dvd this one is a must have both dvds are completely different in the movie version as as well as extra content this truly is a wonderful christmas present from peter jackson and new line to the fans and one that you will keep coming back to in years to come 
i am so in love with lord of the rings and am so glad someone was selling the extended version for me to buy because i am a poor collage student who cant buy a brand new one 
magical mesmerizing mystical and purely delightful i love the way this classic tale was transmitted to the big screen the hobbit houses alone are worth the price of the movie if you loved the books then i guarantee youll love this movie something that i dont often say im looking forward with great anticipation to the next installment 
how long has it been since we last saw a quality sci fi or fantasy film most of the time whenever hollywood makes a film about this genre it gets muddled up with special effects or gets too hyped up for its own good now along comes director peter jackson the frighteners with his unique vision of this classic tolkien trilogy the lord of the rings i must admit that i had reservations about these films but after seeing both the threatrical version and the extended edition i much prefer the ee for the simple fact that the films make more sense with those scenes added back into the film peter jackson has done a wonderful job in the way he handled this movie keeping true to the spirit of the original novel and treating fans of this trilogy with the respect they derserve there is a special feature in this first set that i got a real kick out of the lord of the rings mtv version spoof that appears on the first disk jack black amp sarah michelle geller are hilarious in that little bit and this film with all of its special features comes very highly recommended 
peter jacksons fellowship of the ring is an awe inspiring rendition of tolkeins timeless epic it is one of those rare films that brings tears to ones eyes even while it makes one want to cheer which the audience did in several places including the end my only problem with the film is that i was led to believe that peter jackson shot it in new zeeland clearly jackson found some way to get a camera crew to middle earth and somehow get some of the original participants in the war of the ring to recreate the events they actually lived i do not believe that for example we see ian mclellan playing gandalf i will wager that gandalf is playing himself mark r whittington 
take it from someone who has seen the movie twice this is one of the best films of the year at hours long not minutes as the first review says it goes by in an instant leaving you speechless at the end after all youve just seen with great performances all around especially by sir ian mckellan and christopher lee expert pacing a triumphant and rousing score great special effects and make up and the most epic feel of just about any movie ever made the fellowship of the ring stands out in this dismal year of movies as one of the best of the bunch 
i got the lotr on dvd as soon as it was released and have since watched it from beginning to end at least or times after seeing it in the theatre originally then this extended dvd version came out its wonderful the reinserted scenes were so appropriate to the storyline and the emotional investment of the characters and audience that i can only imagine the nightmare it was for both director and editor to cut them in the first place it is absolutely worth every extra dollar to see the movie as it was originally filmed in the expanded dvd edition i have since seen the two towers in the theatre three times and i will buy the dvd as soon as its released as well 
wow this extended version dvd is definitely an exceptional buy i was disappointed with the regular release version when there were no directors commentary or other good extras and then heard about this dvd set i had to get it and was not at all disappointed i first thought the extra footage was mainly for fans of the book but i think anyone that is into the movies will find the extra footage worth watching theres a whole extra introduction at the beginning on hobbits that is charming and of course the extended gift giving in lothlorien but even more there is more interaction of the characters and story development that explains a lot more while it does change the pacing of the movie somewhat this should not be an issue if you are watching at home on your own time then we have the commentaries i havent got through all of them but they are well done and give you a lot of great information on the making of the movie particularly how jackson created the illusion of the hobbits being so small and even more why they felt certain changes from the book were necessary you have two whole more dvds full of documentaries and extras tons of images and of course a look ahead to two towers i was tickled to also get a free ticket to the two towers but that expires if you havent bought it yet its too bad the whole movie couldnt fit on one dvd but thats a minor nit theres so much here and of course the movie itself is a masterpiece that its only natural that it would be one of the largest dvd sets released for a single movie and just think by the time the last movie comes out well have twelve dvds to deal with the whole series 
the lord of the rings quot the fellowship of the ring quot is an epic struggle if you will relying on million dollars for all three films with each film rounding at three hours wouldnt it get a little tight to fit it all into the budget having a lower than average cast a director never even attempting a major blockbuster before and being based on a very popular book where expectations skyrocket wouldnt audiences share enough gratitude even if they hadnt seen the film firsthand quot rings quot is an astonishing ground breaking surprise the lord of the rings opens with a fearsome monstrous battle introducing the ring and the past behind it the epic lifts off immediately with sword and sorcery action and obviously magnificent special effects we are then introduced to the hobbit elijah wood ian mckellen and ian holm when frodo wood accepts the ring from his uncle bilbo holm the fearful and epic journey begins bringing you into the most magnificent world ever visualized creatures and demons await them at every turn the group of nine struggle to reach mordor where the ring must be destroyed this film is the best fantasy film of all time i have to say that bigger than quot star wars quot and quot the wizard of oz quot this renown and triumphant vision of the classic story is power packed with stylized fun and adventure to rock your mind i literally was on the edge of my seat the film is honestly that good it is probably the best film of the year quot rings quot is obviously off to a magnificent start and i cannot wait for the two towers to come out this film is too good everything is perfect it is so good you dont even realize youre in the theater for three hours the scenery is the best the action and special effects follow continuing the promising film is obviously the wonderously powerful story and the powerhouse performances that sizzle on the stove what created the biggest craving for my mind when watching the film was its ending i completely forgot that there really cant be a conclusion because the two sequels follow the film just kind of ends which kind of left me in a state of wonder the thirst for more is left with me quot rings quot doesnt allow you any guess into the next adventure which builds a lot more anticipation the dramatic scope of its sincerity and promise of near perfection fills the glass immediately with this first installment there isnt a shred of doubt in my mind that the next two pictures will rise and be as glorious as this first film whatever level or scale of genre youre looking for with this film you have it the film is an instant classic i loved every glorified minute of it the action and emotion is there ive never read the book and i dont think ill want to for the first time my fear is that the book may undergo the film fantasy takes its toll being the biggest and best ever and the lord of the rings is a promising treat to being superior to its word and absolutely and perfectly satisfying to the entire audience quote quot the lord of the rings is excellent one of the best of the year everything is perfect nothing falls short or sinks below expectations action adventure visual effects amazing performances magnificent story to film transformation and emotion rule the screen topping star wars and the wizard of oz quot rings quot is the best fantasy film of all time i have no doubt that the sequels will be as disarming and powerful as this film renowned rewarded and revolutionized the lord of the rings is a brilliant adventure drama that left me in a state of awe my anticipation and excitment grows awaiting the next film to come in december quot 
occasionally a controversy arises in advance over whether hollywood can do a book justice in the movie version in the case of lord of the rings make that three movies new line cinema gave new zealand director peter jackson hundreds of millions of dollars to film the entire j r r tolkien trilogy these were shot simultaneously in jacksons native new zealand the first the fellowship of the rings was released last christmas and is now on video and dvd the second will open in theaters in december the third in december so far jackson has triumphed while some purists have complained about certain elements of the movie for example about the lessening of the hobbits roles in fighting the forces of evil most fans seem quite pleased the movie has been a huge hit both here and abroad which indicates its appeal goes far beyond the books rabid supporters the lord of the rings is an epic tale about courage and the dangers of power it takes place in a time long ago in a place called middle earth which both is and is not of our earth it is peopled by far more than mere humans beings there are hobbits and dwarfs elves and goblins wizards and assorted strange creatures once upon a time a great but evil wizard forged powerful rings in the fires of the mountain of doom the mightiest of these he kept for himself but he lost it during a great battle one day a hobbit named bilbo ian holm found it and kept it now he has decided to pass it on to his favorite nephew frodo elijah wood there is great danger for frodo because the wizard will stop at nothing to get it back with the help of another wizard gandolf ian mckellan and others frodo begins a long and treacherous journey to where the ring was created for that is the only place where it can be destroyed the movie is a visual feast computer generated imagery techniques have truly come of age when you mix these cinematic tricks with the naturally awesome and exotic landscapes of new zealand the effect is magical some but not all of this is lost on the small screen for the lord of the rings is designed to be seen larger than life one of the movies great accomplishments is the way it seamlessly matches the small and large characters you would swear that elijah wood is a midget in real life and ian mckellan a giant the cast is superb especially notable are mckellan as gandolf holm as bilbo and wood as frodo these actors will forever be known for these roles also mesmerizing is kate blanchett in her fairly small role as queen galadriel the lord of the rings will not please all viewers it runs three hours the characters travel on and on and on in much the same way peter otoole was forever trooping across the desert in the classic lawrence of arabia also because this is the first in a trilogy it doesnt have a true climax it simply ends with the main characters planning their next moves i personally cant wait to find out what they are 
i have waited for years to see a version of the lord of the rings which lives up to the grandeur of tolkiens book after the disappointment of trying to sit through ralph bakshis animated version i was leary about ever watching a version of the lord of the rings however when i first heard that peter jackson was working on this film i started to look into it to see if it was going to be well worked i was astonished to see that the production team for the lord of the rings was working as extensively as they were most often fantasy films are treated in such a way that it almost seems as though they are thrown together in a rush not so with the lord of the rings not so indeed this movie is the product of much work and good work at that the only day i ever skipped in my senior year of high school and my whole high school career for that was the release day for the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring it was well worth it though i was completely swept off my feet by the magnificence of this film most importantly the fellowship of the ring follows the plot of the book very closely it is most important in this movie because it sets the ground work for the other two movies which were filmed at the same time as the fellowship jackson and his team most logically sorted the story and included all that was necessary in order to make the movie full while not completely overwhelming this movie is characterized by a high sense of adventure when i read the fellowship of the ring i get the same feeling i feel that i am right on the paths of middle earth along with the fellowship watching this movie i was engrossed in middle earth in the same way also howard shore composed a most excellent soundtrack for this film it fits the mood of the story excellently and enhances the its mood making it even more enjoyable indeed this movie is such a great buy that i bought both editions when the first regular edition came out i bought it on vhs because i knew that eventually the extended version would be released having bought the extend version on dvd if you can still find a collectors edition boxed set buy it i can without hesitation say that it even surpasses the original the added footage does not drag the movie down and make it more boring and weighty instead the movie flows even better and gives a fuller picture of tolkiens work also the copious amount of commentaries and other extra features are well worth the extra cost though overwhelming to try to watch them all since there are so many there are few movies in this world which are and a half hours long there are fewer of those movies which i can bear watching lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring was not a chore at all to watch i have spent many hours of my life perhaps days watching and re watching this movie if it were logically possible i would give it stars out of since that is not possible i am resigned to giving it out of stars i recommend it to all 
im going to be brief for a change the theatrical version of quot the fellowship of the ring quot was beautiful and easily the best adaptation of the book that i have ever seen until now the extended edition only adds about thirty minutes to the overall running time but those thirty minutes make an amazing difference little details that were glossed over before are added more depth is given to the characters more time is devoted to events that will have significant impact in the second and third films basically put this version is hard as it may be to believe truer to the book than the theatrical version just because it has a little more time to invest on those all important details oh and the fact that those of us who are stuck on vhs finally get a widescreen edition is a nice touch too i highly recommend this film to anyone who loved the theatrical release but felt that too much was left out this movie goes a long way toward fixing that also if there were some things that those of you who havent read the book had trouble understanding the extra details in this version may help clear things up thats all from me 
this set is just all around excellent you get the deleted scenes put back into the original movie and i think everything ties together quite nicely you also get to watch the interviews with the cast amp crew about location how props and costumes were made and what made the movie really work and finally you get a national geographic dvd that explains a lot about the backstory of lord of the rings a good example would be the various languages amp dialects and how they were created oh i almost forgot the statues are splendid the detail and weight of them both is truly outrageous 
i am a huge lor fan i have read the books like three times and i know that makes me look like a dork but when you like something what can you do and no movie will ever come close to what the books have because the books just have so much detail but this movie did a damn fine job of covering the really important and entertaining parts of the fellowship of the ring i would like to point out how angry i got sitting in the theators and listening to people here and there complain either about how long the movie was or just not getting the storyline well of course you dont get it its based on a very long and complex book with an enormous cast of characters and plotlines if youre not a science fiction fantasy fan then obviously you wont like this movie but if you are or if youre very open minded and like to see fantasy based action movies this is definitely a must see the only complaint that i have about fellowship is that i wish more of the story could have been put into the film but that would have made the movie obscenely long which i would not have complained about but some people might have seriously folks pick up the book give it a read then watch this movie youll enjoy the film that much more even the small story changes are forgivable and make the movie more entertaining the cast is amazing the battle scenes will blow your mind and the flow of the movie will just keep you engrossed but you have to like fantasy just a reminder there 
ive been waiting for this film a long time i had my doubts when i first saw the ending but have since made up my mind that this film is one of the best films ever the directing was beyond my expectations i anticipated lyrical beautiful directing as david lean did with lawrence of arabia but instead peter jackson made the lord of rings a cross between gladiator and saving private ryan elijah wood did a great job holding his own in this film ive notice that ebert and roeper said the film was too long but it didnt seem too long to me hours and minutes is not that long if the movie is good ive seen almost every movie in and at first it was a toss up between a beautiful mind and lord of the rings for best picture of the year but i thought about it while longer and i must say that lord of the rings was it for me that year a friend of mine asked me whether lord of the rings was better than star wars but there is a fundamental difference between the two movies and because star wars is a sci fi epic and lord of the rings is a fantasy epic there is no comparison i am not about to say that lord of the rings is a better movie than star wars besides peter jackson took this saga from a book and george lucas created star wars on his own i have not read the book yet so the ending took me by surprise mr jackson said hes going by the book to make this film and ive only seen the animated version im not going to spoil the ending for anyone 
the epic starts here it was hard to fathom the lord of the rings ever becoming a live action motion picture two horribly failed attempts to animate the story both failed so miserably the funding was pulled before they could be completed proved the work was too big too complicated and too adored by readers to be translated less than perfectly on top of that tolkien created this thick complex world and languages that could not easily be shown or translated to the screen but peter jackson did it from the grand opening shots of the shire to the showdown with the balrog this is a moving stirring emotional spectacle a masterpiece the episodic first installment covers the handing over of the one ring from hobbit bilbo to nephew frodo neither of whom know the rings powers or origin a dark force sauron who forged the ring of power to control the lords and kings of man elves and dwarves existing only as a powerful spirit a great fiery eye sauron searches tirelessly for the ring that can bring him back to form and power when wizard gandalf figures out the nature of the ring in an abiding duh moment he hurries frodo who is quickly joined by fellow hobbits merry pippin and loyal servant samwise away from the shire so that gandalf can figure what the enemy is up to plot a course of action and find a way for frodo to be released of his task of baring the desperately hunted ring of power he fails being capture by turned evil wizard saruman and does not meet up with frodo at the designated place and time frodo and friends being pursued by dark riders the kings of men possessed by the one ring and now ring wraiths is taken under wing by stryder a mysterious vagabond who seems to know more about frodo that frodo the journey takes them to rivendell one of home of the elves and master elrod a council of man wizard dwarf and hobbit is convened and nine go forward to destroy the ring by carrying it into the stronghold of sauron and casting it into the fire from which it was forged the quest take frodo and company to the top of a mountain nearly brought down by saruman to the mines of moria where the entire population of dwarfs mining it have been slaughtered and the fellowship must face an impress army of thousands of orcs a cave troll and the satan like balrog in the end the story concludes by not solving anything but leaving us open for the next film the ride is breathtaking the sets are amazing the costumes acting directing music and sound are all dead on perfect peter jackson never lets the camera stop moving and knows how to film action in a personal and involving way that is rarely seen this grand operatic quest is on a scale never before seen and the dvd and dolby or dts sound are brilliant theres nearly an over abundance of commentary tracks here nearly everyone involved gets one the actors and director writer are the hands down best and worth the four hours to listen to never mind the theatrical version that was great this is grand a must have 
confession i am modern man and as such am frequently very representative of my generation skeptical and dismissive irreverent and difficult to impress in the past i would be hard pressed to admit satisfaction without finding some grievance with anything let alone a hollywood blockbuster but heres the deal peter jacksons fellowship of the ring is as perfect as the hollywood adventure gets i would defend any and all of the changes that were made in adapting tolkiens opus in a blood fight against any jrrt geek who shall step forward fellowship this first part of the trilogy more than towers and rotk begs for contraction it is longest in the number of pages and approximately years falls between the beginning and the end ive heard complaints at the lack of tom bombadil and the barrow wights and i have to tell you that the bombadil section of the story is the most easily omitted mainly because he dominates the one chapter or so and then never comes up again the main point of bombadil is the insertion of some more singing and to dish out magic weaponry this really isnt worth ten minutes of screen time what i love about this movie is the speed and sense of urgency that moves things and yes the result is that a lot of moments of the book get cut this movie has kept the focus solely on the movement of the ring to mount doom this is the best way to do adventure on screen make sure that the characters have major life or death objectives that they continue to pursue some express that the movie omitted the sense that the fellowship had a decision to make over whether to go to mordor or gondor it was not an omission something that they accidentally forget it was a change and a damned good one i love the suggestion that the ring is going to mordor period this is the doubtless objective that drives the film that makes it move well if there was a lot of hesitation and the sense that they were just going south and making the decision later then were left with aimless location driven drivel phantom menace anyone theres been disdain for the fact that frodo tells aragorn hes going by himself to mordor and aragorn accepts it i cannot put into words how genius i think this move is primarily because in the book aragorn figures it out quickly anyway and here were spared a boring scene where they all stand around scratching their heads secondly i always felt it was peculiar that aragorn in the novel wants to protect frodo and yet when he figures out that frodo went off and that boromir tried to take the ring possibly scaring him off that he does not go after him it seems like cowardice because he himself proposed the idea that he go to mordor with frodo and sam and that the others go to gondor in the film frodo gets to look him in the eyes and aragorn knows that he is going off for the right reasons then theres those that gripe about the extended role of arwen probably feeling that its been hollywooded up by adding more of the girl and romance but isnt it queer that aragorn marries arwen who does so little if it happens exactly as the book the audience will end up liking eowyn more as a stronger character not that aragorn has to love the stronger character its just that by showing more of what george costanza would call relationship aragorn aragorn out of the context of the quest or war it doesnt just add more arwen it adds dimension to the future king adds humanity which honestly isnt in the book at least one fan review says something to the extent that many fans take great offense to the fact that glorfindel was eliminated what they dont understand is that in a movie it can be hard to throw in extra characters with extra names mainly because the names are frequently missed their not written down for you to see every few lines after all since glorfindel doesnt ever come up again why burden an audience thats already taking in a lot of info with his presence i feel that the reason some fans are so attached to these small characters glorfindel bombadil lobelia lotho is because theres something lacking in some of the power players in the books my examples are aragorn saruman and to a lesser degree gandalf tolkien creates aragorn and gandalf as almost arrogant know it alls and though he often says that they show mercy or compassion or love or kindness he doesnt show them do it this by the way is a frequent symptom of fantasy and other genre type writing the film has taken bold moves to flesh out these characters and show them as tolkien meant for them to be saruman in the trilogy is an almost sniveling and pathetic villain his power and the power of his voice are stated repeatedly but the few times he shows up there is a real weakness the film has vastly improved on his strength and created a saruman that far exceeds my imagination in venom and charisma in summary i think the great characterization of major players is well worth the expense of the likes of glorfindel and bombadil now it may seem that i am bashing tolkien in my defense of the movie but well maybe i am and im sorry its not that im a jrrt detractor or dont love his works its just that i have experienced lots of different fiction and seen it adapted and frequently characters and dramatics are slighted in a condensed form here that is not the case at all not that lotr is not a staggeringly fantastical work of imaginative power its just that well faulkner it aint 
great movie with lots of action i put it on the level of star wars in terms if movies you can never watch enough times 
in case youre been living under a rock for the past year this is the first of movies adapting jrr tolkiens lord of the rings trilogy for the big screen this is a review of the platinum edition dvd which i purchased in the gift set this is the definitive edition although in his commentary the director does threaten to fix it all up yet again so start saving now for all you tolkien fans there is an extra half hour of movie added which contains most of the character bits and fun stuff that you found missing in the theatrical release it includes the full lothlorien gift sequence which you should force your friends to see before they see the two towers the director and writers commentary track is a delight they tell us why they decided to keep some bits and discard others its clear that all of them have a deep knowledge of the books and related works and made their choices to be true to the themes of the book while changing the exact details for cinematic purposes i havent yet listened to the other three commentary tracks but im looking forward to it the gift set includes a national geographic dvd and a pair of bookends the dvd is very interesting if you want to learn more about the life of jrr tolkien and the influences on the story the bookends are fun to look at but dont seem to be heavy enough to hold up books all that well you may want to save your money and get just the platinum edition dvd instead of this gift set i dont regret it but i dont think its a terrifically good value definitely a keeper i wouldnt plan to find this dvd available used very often 
now some hours after watching this movie for the first time regained my breath and i think i can reasonably analyse the merits or flaws of this movie because while i was there ther was only joy emotion i was watching middle earth in front of my eyes i was watching aragorn gandalf frodo and others played by convinceable actors who clearly gave their best i was watching a movie clearly made by a director tht respected and loved tolkiens work and also was wise enough that he must cut some parts to not kill the project commercially the point as i see is it doesnt matter at all if some things wer left out if the movie is better for who read or for whom not read the books the great quality here is the spirit the pace the tone of the movie they are perfect the special effects has substance and serve the history the cinematography is beyond comments an oscar for sure here the history if you consider this is fantasy is perfect jackson you had a difficult task in your hands and you handled it with skill beyond limits i salute you p s for me the movie was too short i would stand in that chair for six hours with pleasure thinking better i would watch the three movies in a row without problems i can hardly wait for the dvds that surely will be released after 
this is the first part of the epic that is the lord of the rings i must be totally honest when i first read the books i was totally lost i didnt know what was going on then i finally saw the film and was blown away of course i only saw the mere fragment of the film that was the the theatrical version and to add salt to the wound i saw it in full screen sadly this was how i would see the other two films as well but soon i decided to rent the return of the king extended edition but there were no copies left so i decided to start from the beginning i rented the fellowship of the ring having read only scripts of the extended editions it was a thrill to see them played out before me in reality after getting the box set for my birthday it was a thrill to watch the documentaries for the first time having only seen most of the documentaries on the two towers here are the specific reasons why i loved the movie the scenery is so breathtakingly beautiful it looks so organic unlike other epics that take place on planet earth the costumes and the sets look so authentically middle earth even the landscape of new zealand looks more like middle earth the performances from the cast are amazing all of these characters are practically channeling the characters from the book thanks to this movie years later i was watching the aviator starring cate blanchett galadriel and i was thinking galadriels playing katherine hepburn my favorite performance out of all of these talented actors is christopher lee as saruman he is the main reason why i tried to rent the return of the king extended edition the documentaries are fascinating unlike most humdrum making of documentaries the special effects are amazing again it looks so real its a great movie buy it 
seeing quot the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring quot for the first time in a theater in was an awe inspiring experience for me but seeing the special extended version on dvd with thirty extra minutes made the film come to life even more director peter jackson whose directorship of the film was superb did an equally superior job in restoring those thirty extra minutes of film which were completely seamless and exquisitely scored with extra music just for this version equally deserving of praise are the fine actors whose performances breathed life into j r r tolkiens vision of middle earth as well as the many people who worked behind the scenes in set decoration cinematography special effects and editing the story begins with the wizard gandalf ian mckellen coming to pay a visit to his long time hobbit friend bilbo baggins ian holm bilbo has lived a very long life for a hobbit thanks to a small item in his possession a ring its not just any ring though it is the most powerful ring of power created hundreds of years earlier by the dark lord sauron that bilbo found in a cave when he traveled far outside of the shire himself unknown to most the being living in middle earth sauron has returned and wants his ring back and the ring wants to be with sauron gandalf convinces bilbo to give the ring to his nephew frodo baggins elijah wood frodo initially doesnt understand the power of the ring but is soon forced to leave the shire to prevent saurons dark agents from finding it and him traveling with frodo is his friend samwise sam gamgee sean astin who promises gandalf that he will remain with frodo until their mission is over frodo and sam are later joined by two more hobbits peregrin pippin took billy boyd and meriadoc merry brandybuck dominic monaghan frodo only wants to take the ring to a place where it will be safe so that he and his companions can return to the shire but fate places a much more difficult burden upon him to assist frodo in his quest are gandalf his three hobbit friends the humans aragorn a k a strider viggo mortensen amp boromir sean bean the elf legolas greenleaf orlando bloom and the elf gimli john rhys davies other very memorable characters include arwen liv tyler galadriel cate blanchett saruman chistopher lee and elrond hugo weaving overall i rate both the regular and special extended editions of quot the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring quot with a resounding out of stars it is no wonder that the film was nominated for oscars and of those it won for best cinematography best visual effects best makeup and best original music i highly recommend the purchase of either edition on dvd but especially recommend the special extended version with its deeper telling of the story 
when i went to see this movie with my son i thought i was in for a long snooze how wrong i was this movie grabbed me from the start with amazing cinematography special effects acting and a storyline that is compelling beyond imagining all this and a group of characters who are kind of like the justice league of the comics dont let the three hours daunt you as it is the easiest three hours you will ever spend the hardest thing about seeing this movie was that i had to wait almost a year for part viewers that are seeing this for the first time are lucky because part is already out on dvd more good news is that all three films were shot together so the actors dont age between films keeping the continuity that said lets talk about the story balbo baggins a hobbitt has a ring that tries to draw in men to the dark force kind of like the dark force in star wars balbo nearing the end of his life passes the ring to frodo frodo now the keeper of the ring has to battle the urge to put the ring on he wears it around his neck he is visited by a wizard who tells him that the only way to defeat the dark forces is to travel with the ring to their land mordor and cast the ring into the fiery depths inside mordor frodo sets off from the shire with the wizard and three of his hobbitt companions along the way their band is joined by some of the most memorable characters in film history that includes a troll an elf archer and a man the band battles zombie like demons dragons and magic on the way all the while the dark forces continue to tempt frodo and anyone who comes near the ring to put the ring on at one point and i am not sure if it is in this film or in the second film the wizard says that if frodo were to put the ring on mankind would be lost as good as this film is the second film is even better 
i thought there was nothing that could make this movie better i thought that it would be pointless to buy the extended version because the original was already a masterpiece in my mind i was wrong very wrong the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring special extended version is worth every penny the thirty additional minutes really enrich the film more character development is seen and the background story is more clear than ever before its almost like seeing the film for the very first time you start to think to yourself how in the world could they have left this out of the movie this is how the movie shouldve been in the first place but it wouldve probably been a pain to sit through a and a half hour film in the theatres i am glad that peter jackson took great care in releasing an awesome and impressive dvd set that does the film justice the picture is outstanding a lot more crystal clear than the original version which was already really good i am also happy to report that the sound is much better no more will you have to fumble around with the volume control you can actually hear the talking a lot better that was a previous complaint of mine with the original version it would be quiet during the talking scenes and it would be very loud during the action ones you were constantly fooling around with the volume controls which took away some of the enjoyment of watching the film i can assure you that this is much more impressive you can also watch it in dts which is something to experience if you can it doesnt stop there there are two additional disks with bonus materials such as interviews sketches documentaries and more audio commentary is included as well i thought that the documentaries were highly entertaining and interesting they are really worth checking out very very impressive i could go on and on but whats the point if you loved the original version get this one as soon as you can you will not regret it for one second i assure you the additional minutes or more really do enrich the movie that much more you will never go back to the original again that is for sure this can very well be the dvd collection you have been waiting for dont miss this amazing opportunity this is lord of the rings as it shouldve been i am very pleased and i am sure i will never watch the original version ever again a all the way 
when i went to see this movie i thought that most of the scenes would be stretched out and the movie would be too long i was completly wrong in every possible way go see this movie here are the pros and the cons pros amazing cast including elijah wood sir ian mclellan sir ian holm sean astin cate blanchett and liv tyler great plot develpoments no scene is stretched out everything stays in porportion and is always exiting though the movie is hours the exitement and adventure makes it fly bycons if you have young children some parts may be too scary for themthis is one of the ten best movies of it is exiting fun and has a great cast i sugest if you liked the book any of the actors or actresses or just want to see an amazing movie i suggest this is the one that you see
this film is true hardcore fantasy no cyberpunk or technology just good old fashioned hack slash amp wizardry i caught this movie the first day it was released and am so glad i did yes it is hours long but any epic is going to be lengthy this film does the book justice the one thing i was impressed with was the fact that it wasnt quot watered down quot for the kiddies it is rated pg and there are some violent fight scenes that dont apologize when people or orcs get killed i was thoroughly impressed with the way they were able to digitally manipulate the hobbits so that they were able to use average sized actors yet they were still about feet tall and you couldnt tell there was any manipulation clever i totally agree with another reviewer who said this movie beats star wars i am a star wars fan and also say that this film does so much more for me than george lucas ever did of course im a dungeons amp dragons fan so that sways my vote a little i was pleased with the casting also i thought some roles would be compromised with the likes of liv tyler but none of the big names became pre madonnas i was pleased to see ian holm as bilbo and an openly gay ian mckellan as gandalf it just brought back so many memories if youre remotely interested in the fantasy genre you owe it to yourself to see this film and the next two chapters in the trilogy once theyre released 
i must admit that the first time i saw lord of the rings i fell asleep assuming that my falling asleep meant i didnt like the movie i didnt attempt to watch it again until i saw this dvd set and figured it was a great value for the price wow what i missed im glad that i never actually saw the original theatrical version because this extended version of the film is true to the book i knew and loved as a kid while dvds seems like a lot to watch and you probably wont watch them all in one sitting there is just so much out there to see this was truly one of the most ambitious theatrical projects ever taken on and the extra dvds provide so much background on the story the people involved in making the film a cast and crew of thousands and the intricate attention to detail in every sword costume and setting there are extensive interviews with the director the producers stars artists and screenwriters and they all give their take on why the story and the film were so important for a few dollars and a few hours more you really can get a fuller experience from the first installment of the film and it makes the second film that much more enjoyable cant wait for the third installment overall a great investment and a must for any fan of this amazing cinematic experience 
 the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring one of the most anticipated movies of all time one of the most famous and best books ive ever read one of the best ensemble casts since magnolia one of the best new zealand directors out there this movie had a lot going for it i was careful not to get my hopes up too high with this film because i was afraid i would get so excited i wouldnt like it no chance of that this movie was amazing and thats one of the only words than describe it the fact that this movie was made in new zealand worked on a personal level for me because im from the country and know how much of a quiet country it is but it is clear to the world now that my homeplace holds many beautiful sets and secrets the scenery of the mountains hills and towers made me appreciate my country more than i could imagine thanks for the tribute peter jackson to tolkien and to one of the most brilliant places on earth on the subject of peter jackson i have to say that there is not another man director or not out there like him jackson had the courage to bring up the well known tale of the fellowship of the ring taking a whole lot of risks and time of his he wrote directed produced and even made an acting cameo in the movie the man put so much of his heart and effort into this film and it establishes him as finally the best director from new zealand and one of the best around who ever lived okay on with the movie this is not a review of new zealand the films design and structure was excellent the sets were truly magnificent from the fiery keeps of mordor to the quiet beautifully strung together holes of hobbiton and the shire the special effects were really something else taking us to a whole new dimension in the visuals and fx stage the movie is very artistic and perfected to the very last detail all the effort that was poured into the film has certainly paid off it looks and feels in the atmosphere sense of things fantastic as for the acting the cast was really something to treasure i was looking forward to seeing how the characters turned out elijah wood in his first major leading role is charming and believable as the brave but inexperienced hobbit frodo sean astin plays along wood as samwise gamgee frodos best friend astin is a very heartfelt player and i felt his characters decisions were worthy and respected the performance and the character dominic monaghan and billy boyd are fantastic and the hobbits who play mostly in the movie for comic relief liv tyler plays arwen the brave elf daughter of lord elrond a cheesy hugo weaving tyler doesnt have much screen time in the book she appears for about a half a page but she was definitely picked correctly she had the great deep voice for speaking elvish and the beautiful eyes and face to bring across her character viggo mortensen is in my opinion one of the most underrated actors of his generation he was excellent in a perfect murder and even better in this ian mckellen brings across the major best performance though as the wise and elderly gandalf no one couldve played gandalf like mckellen and im still not quite sure why he just has a certain presence as an actor like nobody else in smaller roles christopher lee who reads the lord of the rings books once every year is particularly evil and well cast cate blanchett is stunning yet again though i felt her scene where she transforms is a little unnecessary orlando bloom is defines cool as the elf archer sean bean is very developed and subtle john rhyes davies kind of annoyed me but had a good accent and ian holm my personal favourite supporting actor bar mckellen was adorable as the tiny bilbo and used neat acting techniques also andy serkis has the perfect voice for gollum and peter jackson makes a neat cameo as the first creepy person the hobbits come across in bree the movie keeps the atmosphere and tense and evil as the fellowship take on their brave journey the production overall was just fabulous and the swooping camera shots and amazing artistic techniques kept me on the edge of my seat the script for the movie is also very powerful the scenes were frodo wood and gandalf are just talking and discussing the ring were very subtle witty and enjoyable the characters were developed a lot more at the council of elrond scene and the characters were introduced nicely and quickly but the sense of humour never faded although this is a very seriously written film the continuous evil creatures the fellowship comes across are very imaginative youve got orcs bigger orcs a brilliant and giant cave troll a demon with a whiplash and my personal favourite the ringwraiths past kings who track down the ring for the lord of the ring sauron the ringwraiths provide more atmospheric touches than anybody or anything in the movie their black hoods are evil their voices are whining and creepy their movements most scenes with them in are effectively done in slow motion are scary and quick and damn even their horses seem evil i think ive said about enough of this film now i could go on for days and days but ill stop now before i get carried away if you have not this movie then get out and do so right this minute it doesnt matter if you have or havent read the books the movie will engage you all the same and probably persuade you to read the books if you havent already i conclude this review with a whoop a clap a cheer and big bravo for one of the true modern greats i cant wait for the next two films my grade a 
a cinematic version of tolkiens the lord of the rings ranks up with the hope that lucas will indeed make another star wars trilogy and i think i can safely say this is one of the most anticipated films in the movie industrys long and checkered history you would think its movie paradise considering lucas has been in the midst of another star wars trilogy and lord of the rings has finally got a cinema deal live action but phantom menace proved something of a disappointment mesa jar jar binks and i think quite a few people will enter into the theatre with a certain amount of trepidation theres a reason for that three animated tolkien films have been released with very problematic results the bakshi release is just embarrassing the film is both incoherent and confusing rankin amp basss two movies are fine for little kids those two films are tolkien for saturday morning cartoons they proved my introduction to tolkien and for that i am thankful but the movies still fail to capture the grandeur of tolkiens imagination there are two things to consider here about a work of literature although all good literature has a polarization effect on its readers this work has a gigantic legion of followers which are extremely dedicated to tolkiens vision i count myself a member of this camp the other camp cannot figure out what the big fuss is about and why they should care about the novel now theres a reason why all this is relevant to the film had peter jackson gone to far either way the film would have fallen apart appeal to much to the fan base and you loose the general movie goer appeal to much to the movie goer and youll lose the fan base so when the fan base learned of peter jacksons decision to film all three films at once an unprecedented move in movie history most of us really wanted it to be good but were just simply afraid weve already been burnt would it be so bad that it would alienate both fan base and those who are just looking for a good movie not only does peter jacksons film work its glorious beautiful has all the myth and grandeur of the book jackson a tolkien fanatic could have gotten so involved with bringing out the extremely detailed world tolkien gave us that the pacing would suffer or wed lose patience with all these obscure details which would alienate the regular movie goer not only does he not alienate the general movie goer but he entices the fan base so much they cant help but fall in love with his vision of tolkiens world the only real flaw is how rushed first section of the movie is although i can understand cutting the old forest and tom bombadil the way they handled getting the hobbits out of the shire was unacceptable there is not that sense of camaraderie between the hobbits that there is in the book there is no quot conspiracy quot and merry and pippin just join without any questioning from sam and frodo while jackson does a good job at building the hobbits characters and establishing their personalities i couldnt come up with a good reason why frodo and sam would just let merry and pippin join them the prancing pony is worst there is no questioning from the hobbits about aragorn proving himself there is no scene about him asking them to trust him and the whole sequence feels much too rushed sam only questions aragorn while theyre actually out of the inn and traveling thankfully however that is the only real flaw the rest of the things the script changed tightening elronds council the expansion of arwen cutting sam from the galadriel mirror sequence tempting aragorn with the ring etc i can see why they did it for dramatic tension i also liked the way they handled elronds council because that could have ruined the movie like it did with bakshis they had established and covered much of the material in that chapter elsewhere by means of voice over prologue and actually showing the viewer what is happening especially with the isengard sequences and as a result lessened the screentime of that scene and helping with the dramatics of it as for the controversial expansion of arwen i tend to agree with the film makers in their decision to enlarge her role by making her part of the ford sequence it introduces the character and establishes her in the viewers mind and the relationship between arwen and aragorn is more fully explored as for their romantic interlude in rivendell not only do i agree with that but think it should have been done in the book tolkien did not know who strider was when he was first writing fellowship and did not go back and change the scenes to further explain the romance between arwen and aragorn and by not including a scene in rivendell to establish their love for one another lessens by far the impact of their union in part iii and for once this romantic scene is actually an improvement on the book as for her role in the flight at the ford for the movie they made the right choice though the book is still preferable in achieving the balance between fan base and the more causal fan this film is a spectacular success making a movie out of a book the size of fellowship the fact is you will have to condense tighten rearrange and make changes for dramatic tensions the mediums are different and you cannot have a direct translation from a book to a film despite of what they cut the movie still clocks in at three hours which is very generous the real problem with this film as others noted is its going to be a full two years before we finally get to watch the return of the king in the end we get a movie that stays true to the spirit of the book this is what we tolkien fans have long been waiting for thank you so much peter jackson and your cast and crew 
im not going to get to into it just give it a chance its easily one of the best movies ive ever seen a great story shown really well in the film it hassome really good action scenes great special effects ive already seen it times and i wouldnt mind seeingit again if your bored one night or have nothing else todo give it a chance youll probably like it if your readingthis your atleast somewhat intrested 
any edition that you get you are getting spectacular hobbity goodness so dont stress too much over it lord of the rings is quite a concept originally brought forth by j r r tolkien decades ago unfortunately his book was pages long which is a daunting read thankfully his book has been brought to the big screen for more of a mainstream approach and where more people can enjoy it if nothing else it is easier to enjoy the l o t r movies are not short by any means but if the other option is reading over a thousand pages i choose the movies besides you will probably enjoy yourself so much watching the movies that they will not seem so long if you want him come and claim him said by arwin as she bravely protects the dying frodo on horseback she then draws her sword ready to do battle even though she is outnumbered and up against the nazgul now there was a moment there are more touching moments in the lord of the rings trilogy and many more battle scenes if you have not already seen it what are you waiting for 
true moviegoers have come to know a familiar desire in these days of gross commercialization and cross promotion that an anticipated new film will live up to its hype well quot the fellowship of the ring quot doesnt just live up to its hype it stomps all over it hype becomes a devalued word useless when confronted by a movie this good it is hype proof while its shattering the need for one word it is reincarnating another epic it is a word that has come to represent such ignoble qualities as garishness largess of being over done and over long but quot the fellowship of the ring quot restores the original sense of the word it is historic legendary heroic and grand director peter jackson an intimate artist who just happens to be painting on a large scale here retains most if not all of tolkiens story while shedding a lot of superfluous background information he finds the middle ground between not pandering to those familiar with the book and providing enough background for those not familiar with the book the information presented is necessary and relevant to the story being told but also alludes to the wealth of knowledge laying underneath tempting those who see the movie to go out and delve into the book for more which is really what a good film adaptation should do and jackson known for his keen cinematic eye does not disappoint in fact he exceeds all expectations bringing to the screen a visual aesthetic that is both original and personal he constructs several visceral and kinetic if a bit confusing battle scenes the confusion works however in that it brings a real sense of danger to the scenes the scenery he or rather grant major created was breathtaking when it needed to be and foreboding when necessary but always real textured and inspiring the shire was quaint and wondrous rivendell was majestic and picturesque mordor was vile and perilous jackson for all his skills with visual aesthetics never lets it trample on his characters most were fully drawn with real emotion and motivations legolas didnt say much but when he did it spoke volumes boromir a conflicted man whose purpose to the plot is paramount was handled well with the respect and care the character deserves gandalf the grey who has become the archetypal omnipotent wizard could have been portrayed as just that but that would not have been true to the character like in the book gandalf is not all powerful especially when confronted by in one memorable scene the formerly good now evil wizard saruman gandalf is a flawed man but wise enough to know how to overcome his weaknesses for the good of the fellowship and frodo baggins the little hobbit entrusted with the ring begins life as a wide eyed innocent but we watch him grow and learn of the magnitude of his task sensing along with him the fear and obligation he comes to know but the one character who made the most seamless jump from book to film was strider he was my favourite character in the book and my assessment of him hasnt changed in his celluloid form in fact the film strider may have even more depth as his key background information which in the books doesnt come till much later is revealed early on it doesnt take away from the flow of the story as far as im concerned because jackson handles the release of this information with a skillful touch i was worried that rumours of broadened female roles in a cheap attempt to widen the films appeal would be true rest easy friends theyre not arwen and galadriel even though theyre played by big name actresses appear enough in the movie so that they register but not so much that theyll anger hardcore tolkien fans some characters however left something to be desired gimli the dwarf was all gruff exterior with no inner machinations to speak of he has one line in the mines of moria that while funny seems terribly out of place pippin and merry acted more like the two stooges than loyal fellows however they did provide the film with some much needed comic relief and will get many opportunities to grow in the next movie of the trilogy any criticisms leveled at these three characters however do not detract from the movie at all it should also be noted that all of the characters were perfectly cast any reservations i had about say sean astin as samwise or liv tyler as arwen were quickly put to rest and some choices like ian mckellen as gandalf viggo mortensen as strider or even elijah wood as frodo were nothing short of perfect inspiration quot the fellowship of the ring quot is not for the casual moviegoer it demands your attention and at times that you do some homework before viewing its a movie epic in scope but aware of the importance of its small details the musical score by howard shore and the cinematography by andrew lesnie were always spectacular but never intrusive and even though it runs a hair under three hours youll wish that the filmmakers had given you more they will dont worry although youll need some time to once again be able to produce adrenalin and experience awe and if the next two movies are anywhere near as good as this one well were all going for a wonderful ride 
this is an absolutely mind blowing and stunning work of unspeakable proportions with the directing of peter jackson and a near perfect cast quot fellowship quot is brought out of the book and brought to life on the big screen and what a movie this isnt just your typical fantasy movie this is an experience and its just the beginning of whats to come later on the extended edition makes either the platinum extended edition or the collectors gift set worth every penny bringing out new scenes not seen on the regular edition of the movie a definate classic for the ages well done peter 
considered both as fantasy adventure and as an adaptation of a beloved literary classic peter jacksons film of quot the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring quot sets new standards for cinematic excellence everything about this film feels exactly right from the casting to the screenplay to the special effects the last are amazing putting to shame anything george lucas has come up with and yet they always serve to advance the story unlike lucas theres never any hint that jackson is merely playing with his toys jackson shows great respect for tolkiens text but not slavish devotion certain characters such as the lovable tom bombadil and frodos poisonous aunt lobelia are missing and tolkien would be chagrined to find that the little poems and songs he loved to write are nowhere quoted but if jackson gives short shrift to tolkiens whimsy he more than makes up for that by giving us tolkiens intensity pathos and moral vision absolutely undiluted above all jackson never forgets that tolkiens chief emphasis was always on the characters he created jackson casts wonderful actors to play those characters and again unlike lucas he actually allows them to give performances how wonderful to find the great sir ian mckellen a uniquely commanding and charismatic actor as gandalf or the charming and touching elijah wood as frodo you can go straight down the list viggo mortensen as aragorn sean astin as sam ian holm as bilbo cate blanchett as galadriel and find nothing but perfection this is one of the very few big budget blockbusters that unqualifiedly deserves its success and all we can do now is look forward with excitement to the release of quot the two towers quot in and quot the return of the king quot in like the books they came from these three fillms will be cherished by future generations 
the lord of the rings trilogy is a great series for kids and adults i like the characters the plot and the action i had the other two movies in the series so this one completes the trilogy 
i was worried that peter jackson might botch the trilogy up simply b c his previous two films didnt work for me so as the opening of the first lotr film got closer and closer i was really starting to wonder see i knew that comparing this to star wars that the fantasy genre would go nowhere in movies if lotr bombed fortunately i was wrong about jackson and the quality of the movie so i am gladly eating my hat fellowship begins the tale of the struggle between good and evil in which the evil lords ring which is imbued with a great deal of his essence is lost after good wins through a series of incidents frodo baggins a young hobbit inherits the ring but finds out that it must be destroyed or the world will end in fire the extended version includes extra footages like more fight scenes with the uruk hai a scene of merry and pippin dancing additional shire material in the beginning more with the fight at moria a bit more travel time and sequences at rivendell and more backstory about gollum but the true treasure of this four cd set lies in the commentary of the creative team did you know that galadriel is a great aunt to arwen so when she talks to aragorn about his relationship with her its more of a big deal than we think theres lots about the makeup of the hobbits and especially the hours spent on the feet and makeup details of how the orcs and other fantastic creatures were made especially about the rock troll did you know that some of the people passing by the hobbits at the prancing pony were acrobatic women on stilts how many times they rewrote the prelude which introduced sauron the makeup and design of rivendell why it was set with nature and many open causeways to the elements how the director got some of the most famous artists who did renditions of tolkien to work on the set how the cast was chosen it goes through the whole movie with commentary by the director and writers and then another run through with commentary by the actors why the prologue with the battle against sauron kept being taken out and then being put back in how the director told ian mckellan i e gandalf to compare frodo volunteering to taking the ring to having a son who just volunteered to fight in the wwi trenches how sean astin hurt his foot the cgi and how it helped plot the story dwarf tossing remarks the design of the balrog why tom bombadil didnt make it in the movie how the director and writers had to deal with the producers and studios to accomplish certain feats i e like letting gandalf smoke overall a smashing success purists of the books will hate it or find something to gripe about everyone else will love 
as the first movie in the epic lord of the rings trilogy the fellowship of the ring is a grand emotional and rousing film that brought the fantasy genre to another level what the books did for bringing fantasy genre to adults this movie did for fantasy genre in movies theere is so much t enjoy awe and rave about this movie that we could start talking at noon and end at midnight new zealand director peter jackson has given the movies a sense of unbelievable scope but also gives us memorable characters that stick with us long after frodo and sam make their way into mordor for those who dont know the story from the books frodo elijah wood is a hobbit a small peace loving creature who really wants to do with little in the rest of the world even though he often begs gandalf ian mckallen for news of the outside world but he soons inherits from his uncle a powerful ring that was made three thousand years ago by a ruthless being named sauron whose one goal was to control all life in middle earth now he has regained enough power to start gathering an army and once again launch an assault on the now dwindled forces of resistance of middle earth frodo along with his faithful friends sam sean astin merry and pippin flee to the elf haven of rivendell where a fellowship is made of the dominate races of middle earth their mission is to destroy the ring and end forever the threat of sauron along with that intricate plot the acting is superb english vets ian mckallen and christopher lee saruman lead the way with masterful performances and they show off their talents as well groomed and experienced actors but there are more than just the wisdom the young actors who portay the hobbits are just wonderful and delightful to watch not to mention viggo mortensen aragorn orlando bloom legolas john ryes davis gimli liv tyler arwen hugo weaving elrond and cate blanchet galadreil all give memorable performances then they are the matter of the special effects they are spectacular from the opening battle sequence on the slopes of mount doom the panorama shots of hobbiton the computerized orcs in the halls of moria and especially the the world frodo enters when he wears the ring of power are wonders of cgi and the massive pre production that went on before the actual filming began the oscar for best visual effects went to the right place one other reason why the movie was such a success was because of the many moods settings and styles that the film executes with grace and near perfection we have action in the mountain of moria romance in rivendell suspence in the chase between arwen and frodo and the ominous ringwraiths and effective comic relief from merry and pippin almost anyone can find something to enjoy in this movie you can find this movie to be one of the best ever made it is executed so well the story so well told and the scope so epic that you cannot help but be in awe yeah its three hourslond but it is one you will enjoy without noticing or feeling the time i seen other movies half as long but they felt slow and insipid this one movie is not one of them 
a long absent evil returns to loom over the free lands of middle earth and it needs only the one ring to become an unstoppable force of destruction luckily the one ring of power lost for over three thousand years has come into the hands of a humble young hobbit named frodo baggins with the benign wizard gandalf the grey to instruct him frodo and his best friend samwise gamgee travel with two other hobbit companions to the woodland realm of the elves led by a mysterious ranger called strider once there the band of heroes is joined by legolas the elf a nobleman named boromir and gimli the dwarf forming the fellowship of the ring it is the quest of the fellowship to take the evil ring to the fires of mount doom in the land of mordor to destroy it it is a perilous journey however along the way they must face monstrous creatures such as orcs ringwraiths cave trolls goblins and all manner of other horrors but they will also discover the distant majesties of their world the fascinating cultures beautiful beings and awe inspiring landscapes they must always remain on guard though because there are less obvious dangers lurking as well the dark lord saurons demonic eye is ever watchful his spies seek out the hobbits in search of the one ring and the ring itself is the greatest danger of all its wicked power seeks to envelop all who are near and lead them to certain doom based on the renowned books by author j r r tolkien lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is only the first in a three part fantasy epic that is mindblowing to say the least director peter jackson surprisingly coming from a no budget splatter film background brings the world of middle earth to fantastic and astonishing reality intense detail in every aspect of the filmmaking process has resulted in a trilogy like no other it is pointless to single out performances here for every cast member is perfection the visual effects are flawless the music is inspiring and the settings are incomparable the great attention to detail results in a medieval world that fantastic as it is seems real the languages are real the various cultures are in depth and at the heart of it all is the message that no creature is so small that it is insignificant or incapable of making a difference this is filmmaking at its finest can any one film of the trilogy stand alone as a viewing experience yes and no the films are each fantastic and plenty lengthy though there is never a dull moment but they are unquestionably all one single story they must all be seen consecutively and in order though you dont have to watch them all in one day this widescreen disc edition of the dvd presents the film as it was released in theaters with a beautiful widescreen format and a fine collection of extras that include featurettes on the making of the film short web featurettes theatrical trailers and tv spots a music video by enya a preview of the second film in the trilogy two towers and its video game and believe it or not a preview of the extended edition of the dvd thats right some time after the release of this theatrical edition extended editions of the already lengthy films were released on dvd those must be really long and they probably have some great extras too maybe the audio commentaries or production art we dont get here regardless even peter jackson refers to the theatrical releases as the preferred versions so make your choice you might even feel like owning both versions any way you go you cant lose fantastic films in the past there have been animated versions of the lord of the rings and the preceding tale by j r r tolkien the hobbit you may want to discover these for yourself i cant wholeheartedly recommend them as i havent seen them since childhood and i recall the animation being a bit weak to say the least still its been a long time but dont expect them to come anywhere near these versions also recommended for lord of the rings fans the black cauldron the dark crystal labyrinth legend the last unicorn the princess bride the sword in the stone excalibur dragonslayer merlin the harry potter series the star wars saga still my favorite film series but im a longtime fan indiana jones and the last crusade monty python and the holy grail willow clash of the titans robin hood prince of thieves and im sure im forgetting many more also check out a much younger elijah wood in the adventures of huck finn another of my all time favorite films and pick up peter jacksons king kong another extraordinary achievement oh and visit my gallery at slave moonlight deviantart com to read my disney lord of the rings fan comic its only pages in as i write this review but its somewhat entertaining if i do say so myself ha 
you all have seen lotr but if you saw it in the theater and really like it and all get ready to experience it again with new scenes showing up like the fellowship recieving their gift from galadriel a lot of the new scenes are meant to hold true to the books even more the extended scens are literally like name and some good ones like extended isuldur losing the ring and aragonr slicing off limbs of orcs for an additional seconds and the movie itself did such a good job at following the story as well as it could have and the main reason for this is the scenery if you have ever liked any of the drawings on all the various books throughout the years then strap yourself in for this this is the truest depiction of tolkiens world that could have been achieved now the behind the scenes stuff will show how they acieved all of this and man i never thought i could sit through like hours of special features for one movie release i honestly wish there was a bit more but i certainly got my fill with the next two chapters now hours isn t exact but im sure someone like me would actually time all of this and make it an all day thing and then when were dne we would realize what the fuhkc and i would feel like the biggest retard ever but the features are seriously like hours or so on discs and then there is like freaking commentaries the commentaries i can say that i only listened to of them btu they were really good the directors and cast i listened to for all movies and the directors was ok like i said i made it through like hours of these people but the cast was the real bright point i think that they had everybody on there but viggo and they definitely talked about him enough the four hobbits are all sitting together but it sounds like evrybody else is recorded but it is done so well i didnt even notice till like the seocnd movie this commentary i have to say is the only one that i have ever enjoyed all the way through and the fact you have like or so people show up throughout you cant go wrong with this i have listeded to a few hours of the other commentaries and they are pretty good but there is like people all together it seems but i know i will watch them somewhere in the future the special features would literally take a list of like features so i will give yuo the beginning and end it starts with the first of a part series on tolkien talking mainly about his life his books i have to say that pretty much everthing gets a or in this disc set but these and the wonderful extended scenes in the movie are my favorites i would rate it a for all parts the rest of the special features explains a lot of make up stuff miniatures bigatures make up designing everything cgi costumes acting getting it from book to script locations sets i highly recommend everthing in this set certianly only buy if you are going to get all together or in time and if you are a fan of these movies you will not be dissapointed 
generally im not a fan of fantasy novels and i must admit to never having had the urge to even try to read jrr tolkiens epic books written decades ago nor have i read the likes of terry pratchett or jk rowlings harry potter books although i must admit to a childhood appreciation of cs lewis a few years ago when i read that they were making the lord of the rings into a trilogy of movies and my favourite movie magazines writers were wetting themselves with excitement i thought so what director peter jackson heavenly creatures didnt have that much of a track record sword and sorcery was definitely not my thing and besides im an adult and i thought that kind of stuff was for kids that was until december when i first saw lord of the rings fellowship of the ring and was blown away by this cinematic masterpiece so what can you say about lord of the rings that hasnt already been said in my view in there were two great and i mean great movies made lord of the rings and moulin rouge but did oscar recognise either movie of course not because oscar prefers mediocrity oscar prefers cynically made ive got a disability and im going to overcome it movies the problem with lord of the rings is that nobody had a disability none of the major characters was blind autistic schizophrenic or could paint with their left foot and everybody knows to win any of the major oscars you need a major disability you need to follow a formula and you need to be popular and previously unfairly overlooked by the academy for the best work of your life then eventually it will become your turn if it happens to be politically correct that year and if the movie studio spends millions of dollars on a publicity campaign the fact that lord of the rings was perhaps the best movie of that year and outstanding directorial achievement was apparently inconsequential to the academy but then why should that surprise anybody the lord of the rings starts by explaining the history of the rings how they were forged how the forces of evil were defeated and how through the greed of man the one ring that could control all survived and eventually ended up in the possession bilbo baggins ian holm one of the diminutive peace loving hobbits who live in the shire on the occasion of his th birthday bilbo overcome with wanderlust sets off on a journey across middle earth and at the behest of the good wizard gandalf sir ian mckellen he entrusts the ring to his young nephew frodo elijah wood however it is not long before the forces of evil are in hot pursuit of the ring led by another wizard saruman christopher lee under the influence of the abominable sauron the evil force that originally created and controlled the ring and that previously had plunged middle earth into darkness this leads to frodo having to flee the shire to the elf city of rivendell with three of his fellow and rather mischievous hobbits for company hotly pursued by saurons evil cloaked nightriders on eventually and not so safely arriving at rivendell and after much debate it is decided that the ring must be destroyed in the only place possible in the fires of mount doom where it was originally forged and the quest to destroy the ring sets out in earnest with a multi nationed although apparently not multi racial fellowship of wizards hobbits elves humans and dwarves once again however danger is not far behind in the shape of the hideous and unbelievably ferocious orcs and in the hearts of the fellowship themselves parents beware the lord of the rings is punctuated by action scenes that lift the tempo of the movie and get the audiences adrenalin flowing but they do feature some a lot of violence torture mutilation decapitation death and i have to say that i was very surprised at the rating given to it in the uk which allowed very young children to see it for this is not a childrens movie and despite its mythic swords and sorcery basis it is certainly not harry potter at the heart of tolkiens story is that evil and hatred lurks in the heart of every person and that the ring draws these feelings to the surface and apparently much of tolkiens inspiration behind the moral tone of lord of the rings was the rise of the nazis prior to and during the second world war hence unlike most great mythological quests where the object is to attain some great treasure or object that will provide its bearer with some great power or wealth at the centre of the lord of the rings is the quest to destroy an object of great power in the fires of doom in order to vanquish evil and bring peace for all eternity although a posterior numbing nearly three hours long at the end of the fellowship of the ring i was left frustrated and desperate for more i wanted to stay seated and for the movie theatre to immediately start showing the second part of the trilogy the two towers i didnt want to have to wait a year for the sequel or eight months for the dvd such was my enjoyment of this movie for peter jackson has achieved what supposedly could not be achieved in providing us with a fast moving and totally enthralling tale set against the beautiful backdrop of the new zealand landscape snow capped mountains beautiful lakes rivers and valleys idyllic farmland great expanses of woodland and beautiful and exotic flora the new zealand tourist board will forever be in his debt the sets and special effects are all excellent as is the cast magnificently led by sir ian mckellen as the great wizard gandalf who does a magnificent job steering well clear of the ham he is brilliantly supported by the likes of ian holm elijah wood sean bean christopher lee cate blanchett liv tyler orlando bloom sean astin and in particular in what might well be a breakthrough performance viggo mortensen as aragorn aka strider whilst frances walshs screenplay must also be given much credit like many millions of other people across the planet i eagerly await the second part of the trilogy the two towers as for the fellowship of the ring it fully deserves five stars if not six five stars are all too often too easily dispensed by amazon reviewers movie entertainment doesnt get any better than this and if you disagree then you are entitled to your opinion it is just that on this occasion your opinion happens to be wrong 
lord of the rings has been one of the most widely anticipated motion pictures in years could peter jackson make a film that for decades was considered unfilmable in every sense of the word yes this film isnt just good it is a true classic full of incredible imagery and special effects highly emotive acting and best of all based on one of the most famous fantasy epics of last century there is just so much in the film that its more than generous running time at just under hours is put to full use by the end you will feel exhausted but in the best sense having experienced almost every emotion any film can create pointless saying more go and see it today on the big screen to miss this is missing what cinema is all about pure escapism at its absolute best peter jackson thank you for making one of the best films ive ever seen 
for those who enjoyed the teatrical release but felt it didnt measure up to the epic proportions of the novel youre in for a real treat unencumbered by time restrictions peter jackson gives us the full epic vision of what this film should be there is more background on the hobbits more character development more of everything really this is not a directors cut that merely tacks on scenes that shouldnt have been included anyway this is a virtually perfect and very refreshing vision of tolkiens world as in all trilogies this first installment is more about establishing background setting and characters there is every reason to think that each film will be better than the first and that this series will surpass star wars as a great fantasy classic i cant wait for the two towers 
you cant make a novel into a film without losing something important things from the book are lost the gentle englishness of the hobbits is only hinted at the songs and stories the love of food tea and southfarthing leaf that makes the world of the shire worth saving is only faintly present the song and stories of the elves are barely present i do miss those things but jackson would have needed six movies to leave all that in this film does tell the story quite well it captures the epic scope of the tale it has the moral core intact it is done as rightly as it could be done it is exciting to experience i dreaded seeing the first installment now i eagerly await the two towers the lord of the rings was written by a man out of the nineteenth century who saw the rise of industrialized evil in the bloody twentieth century to me it has always seemed a requiem for a happier if poorer life it also seemed to be about the necessity of that loss when evil rises over the world tolkien wrote that he hated allegory but one cannot see the rise and fall of fascism is europe and not see the lidless eye this is a great book made into a different but still great film i recommend it heartily some notes on the dvd itself im not so attached to special features that i like disc sets this is a disc set with more discs coming in an extended version later this year this movie cost so much to make i understand the need to sell the movie more than once and i hope they do make money it should be possible to do a job this well and profit by it but i could have done with just the movie most of the special features were broadcast on tv or available as clips on the web 
this first film in the lord of the rings trilogy has surpassed expectations and silenced all but the harshest of critics the director peter jackson has taken a book that many said was unfilmable and produced a masterpiece the fellowship of the ring follows the journey of frodo baggins and his companions in a quest to destroy the one ring the evil ring created by sauron in order for him to rule middle earth although there are some well known names in the cast none of them are so famous that their fame intrudes on the character sir ian mckellan plays gandalf the grey as if born to the part as does viggo mortenson as the ranger aragorn sean bean plays boromir representative of men ian holm is the hobbit bilbo baggins and christopher lee plays a suitably evil wizard saruman ally of sauron legolas is played by orlando bloom who although unknown at that time was catapulted to stardom by his sensitive portrayal of the young elven prince this four disc dvd features an extended edition of the film which is over two discs and also two discs of extra features the additional scenes are seamlessly inserted into the movie and they certainly add to the viewing experience by explaining some things that were left out of the theatrical release the extras on discs are too numerous to mention but include several featurettes artwork costumes weaponry and characters to name but a few in addition the collector set has a terrific pair of bookends modelled on the argonath statues featured in the movie this is sure to become one of the greatest movie experiences of modern times and this collector set is a must for any fan of lord of the rings 
as a almost lifelong tolkien fan i have been anticipating this film for about years i went to see it the day it was released and to be honest i have virtually nothing to complain about i dont want to sound like one of those people who loves everything because believe me i can be picky but peter jackson did such a good job on the lord of the rings that i am completely satisfied first of all there definitely were a lot of changes made that didnt correspond with the books whole chapters were left out old man willow and tom bombadil to name a couple different things were put in and yet the movie seemed to flow perfectly rabid tolkien fanatics will always find something to gripe about but the rest of us will most likely appreciate a movie well done i think that the changes that were made were done with great care and after a day or two of thinking about it i can understand why peter jackson did what he did its better to think of the movie as a companion piece to the book rather than an actual carbon copy of the book put on screen i see the book as tolkiens work and the movie as peter jacksons vision and interpretation of the book two completely separate things and then there is the acting i thought it was done superbly especially gandalf if someone had told me during the movie that an actor was actually portraying gandalf i wouldnt have believed them ian mckellen could not have done better i also appreciated how galadriel is depicted as beautiful yet dangerous and frightening at the same time boromir was done extremely well as was aragorn the scenery was breathtaking new zealand is a beautiful place and perfect for the lord of the rings the mountains valleys forests and rivers really brought middle earth to life i would recommend this film to anyone young or old tolkien fan or not however if you are one of those tolkien purists then be prepared for disappointment because there are a lot of changes but in my opinion they were all for the good except for the fact that frodo didnt sing in bree but thats trivial go see the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring you wont regret it 
the makers of lord of the rings invested incredible time energy and talent in bringing fellowship of the ring to life their results would have proven intensely satisfying to tolkein himself author of lord of the rings faithfully putting amazing effort into creating the world of middle earth the attention to detail is evident in every frame of the film director peter jackson demanded the absolute best from every artist involved in the production sets for hobbiton bag end and rivendell were astounding efforts made full sized and matching the description given by tolkein with unrelenting exactitude the actors were perfectly suited to the roles they portrayed particularly the characters of gandalph the wizard frodo baggins samwise and aragorn liv tyler gives an amazing performance as arwen the black riders nazgul were rendered with terrifying accuracy this production is to film what shakespeare is to literature while a bit longish there is never wasted time or superfluous shots the entire film is wholly satisfying to tolkein fans who loved the books and were sorely disappointed by past efforts to dramatize lord of the rings i am amazed that there are sundry individuals who gave a bad review to this film this speaks more to the character of the reviewer than the quality of the film itself or perhaps failed to grasp the depth of tolkeins writing do not allow yourself to be dissauded from seeing and owning this film by reviews penned by those who lack appreciation for the artistic merit and monumental effort of the filmmakers of lotr read the books see the film and i am certain you will see how wonderfully the movie captures the spirit tolkein intended there is no film of recent vintage that i would recommend more highly than lord of the rings fellowship of the ring certainly no film of recent vintage has put forth more effort more artistic faithfulness nor inspired creative talent than the makers of this film working more than a year before production actually started they transformed the new zealand countryside into hobbiton they did so with amazing purity and faithfulness to tolkeins work this film is excellent beyond my ability to praise appropriately the best way to appreciate the film is to read tolkein then see the film yourself you will discover as i did that the images tolkein inspires in your mind have come to life in lord of the rings 
completely worth it to buy the special edition of this movie it has a lot of neat things that youll love if you enjoy the movie and this movie should be enjoyed by all it is brilliant in many ways along with the story a great movie 
i think well it doesnt matter what i think i could never say for sure whether tolkien would like this movie or not ive read alot about the man though and i cant help thinking that he would have at least been interested to see this human depiction of his novels though yes things are different in the movie at some places then they were in the book there is no need to get upset over it afterall think of it this way it could have been worse and no they dont sing the songs from the book i personally am glad i would have been very sorry to see those actors try to sing at all and the poor soul who got the job of writing music to the rhymes well id pity him i do think however that at least all of the characters carried with them some of the essence and appeal that they have in the books my older sister says that if she could ever re do the movie she would use all the same actors i think that says something for their performance right there even though some people might not like the people chosen to play the characters e g elijah wood liv tyler they do have to admit that considering the task they were undertaking no one else could have done it i mean who would you have of all our modern hollywood actors play arwen julia roberts i hope not as for peter jacksons take on lotr i am glad that he did change a few things even if they were important details exactness is not always the best when attempting to convert a novel to a movie also peter jackson is not j r r tolkien i should hope that he wouldnt pretend to be and go about making the movies as if he were someone he wasnt the movies are one mans impressions of an epic story it is wonderful that they are significant enough to share with the whole world if you feel you could do better i say to you then do it ha id like to see you try 
i remember reading the lord of the rings trilogy originally in and thought it was one of the best series of books up there with the dragonlance chronicles when first hearing that there was going to be a movie based on the books i was rather excited but not overly excited knowing that movies are almost never as good as the books i was also overly religious at that time and just wasnt in the habit of going to the movies therefore rather than catching it in december of like most people i caught it late in the theatre with a friend on valentines day im kind of glad i waited because by this time the crowds were much thinner however the movie was so good that i made sure to catch the next two on the day it was released dealing with the overcrowded theater so now onto the movie as most know the movie is based on the first book of j r r tolkiens lord of the rings trilogy aside from the fact that the movie is not as good as the book this was the beginning of the story of what would become the first of three of the best movies i have ever seen in case there are people out there that do not know the setting of lord of the rings it is a fantasy based movie there are various well known mythological races such as elves dwarfs orcs goblins and of course the species that always seems to have the shortest life span when it comes to fantasy movies and books humans i dont know what it is about fantasy writers but all these other races are either immortal or have long life spans however hobbits which i believe are an invention of j r r tolkien and play a significant part in the series have only a little bit longer of a lifespan hobbits are an interesting race as they are smaller human like beings that seem to exist separate from the other races of middle earth the plot of the story is based around the race of hobbits in particular becoming a vital part in the war to stop the evil lord sauron from gaining control of middle earth they know very little knowledge of the world and are not trained in fighting skills which only complicates their challenge the fellowship of the ring is a lengthy movie and some people may find it boring at times i know people who said they fell asleep during the movie because it was so long and seemed like it dragged on so this movie isnt for everyone i would say that if you are a fan of epics such as harry potter and pirates of the caribbean you might like this movie the movie has a good variety of shifting between action and storyline one moment the main characters may be trying to escape whatever evil is chasing them only to enter an elvin land which the pace slows down and the story continues to be told i am one of those people who like to look at possible symbolic meanings behind the entertainment that i enjoy of course this is very subjective but it is my review style the ring of power which plays a focal point in the movie seems to me to be a symbol of our nature to hunger for power and greed the hobbits seem to be relatively immune to the ring perhaps from being accustomed to the simple life but as one can see even the innocent are susceptible to longings for greed and power the ring seems to draw out the worst in the characters and even a person who longs to use power to do good can even be corrupted it is also about coming together for a common purpose and therefore needing to set aside their differences in order to succeed the characterization is excellent as one gets to see the inner struggles of the main characters this movie is excellent for someone who likes adventure and action with a strong meaningful storyline of course i recommend reading the books as they help fill in some of the gaps that the movie doesnt bring forth however this movie along with the two after it do stand well on their own i also highly recommend watching the extended edition it just well gives more to the story 
as the start of a trilogy the fellowship of the ring is a masterpiece the storyline concerns a union of elves dwarves hobbits and humans led by a a wizard named gandolf who embark on a perilous quest through the mythical realm of mordor their destination the mount of doom where the deadly ring of power was forged by the evil sauron their mission destroy the deadly ring of power the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is an astonishing masterpiece that is not to be missed it is the kind of movie youll want to see over and over again also i highly reccomend the soundtrack which is well worth the purchase price 
the greatest movie i have ever seen in my whole life it starts out when frodo takes hold of the ring of sauron the dark lord soon he is on a journey with three friends sam pippin and a few others when gandalf the wizard is betrayed by sauruman frodo and his clan meet aragorn a ranger at a bar soon they fall into danger when a dark rider comes and poisons frodo with the sword frodo would had died if it wasnt for aragorn when they reach a place called rivendel where they find gandalf and get more companions which makes them the fellowship of the ring they go to the mines of morian where they encounter orcs soon they break up in a battle with orcs and the fellowship breaks apart i love this story because its so exciting and adventurous my kind of movie the best part is the scenery and the special effects yes this is the movie of the year
director peter jackson whom for years i felt was very underrated and underappreciated after crafting such films like dead alive bad taste and the frighteners all of which proved his power of imagination over budget managed to bring j r r tolkiens epic lord of the rings saga to the big screen almost flawlessly blending top notch cgi animation most of which blows away anything offered by george lucas old camera tricks to make the actors playing hobbits and dwarves appear smaller than humans and elves and the beauty of new zealand as a backdrop jackson has brought tolkiens visionary middle earth to life and old tolkien fans could not be happier elijah wood frodo ian mckellen gandalf and viggo mortenson aragorn are all fantastic in their roles mortenson will become a much bigger star than he already is and the rest of the all star cast includes liv tyler sean astin orlando bloom john rhys davis hugo weaving christopher lee sean bean cate blanchet and ian holm all of which give quite memorable performances the action scenes are nicely put together but sometimes the fight scenes can become a bit blurry and incoherent but that is only a minor complaint all in all even if youve never read the original books by tolkien you will find something to love with this first installment of the lord of the rings this will be the star wars trilogy for a new generation and will be cherished for years to come this extended edition is lightyears beyond the original theatrical version dvd release but it can be upsetting considering with the looming release of the two towers on dvd that a few months later an extended edition of that will be released as well i despise it when different quot newer and better quot dvd editions are released from the movie studios just for the sake of making more money 
this is a movie with heart with realistic characterswith real mountains and valleysthe middle heart comes to lifenot a digital picture without a plotits a gift its precious to mewonderful musicoutstanding actingthanks peter j r r would be proud
i finally saw the lord of the rings in the theater not too long ago and i thought that it was not just a good movie oh no it was a great movie this first chapter in the lord of the rings trilogy the fellowship of the ring followed the book excellently with plenty of action and astounding special effects as for the acting i have to give a lot of credit to ian mckellen portraying the wizard gandalf one of the absolute best mckellen performances that i have seen since x men the other actors including elijah wood frodo liv tyler arwen viggo mortensen stryder sean astin sam and ian holm bilbo gave great performances alongside ian mckellen the fellowship of the ring takes place after the story of bilbo baggins in the hobbit this time it concerns frodo baggins wood a hobbit that unexpectedly gets a mysterious ring that overpowers all others etc but this ring is no ordinary ring this ring can control everything in the world frodos longtime friend and mentor gandalf mckellen knows all about this ring and tells frodo that it must be destroyed from where it was made from and during the film frodo volunteers to destroy the ring and a fellowship of nine including gandalf and a ranger named stryder mortensen is formed in order to destroy the cursed ring in conclusion this first chapter has it all great storytelling and a top notch cast led by ian mckellen and elijah wood i cannot wait for the two towers due in christmas and the return of the king due in christmas this is definitely a dvd must have for any lord of the rings fan 
this movie has it all suspense good verses evil good character development and alot of action of course you have to buy into the idea of the fantasy world and its characters for the story to work i highly recommend this movie 
now let me get started by saying that i dont easily confess i was wrong to others but this is worth it ive already reviewed this product and at the time i was all for harry potter so i gave this a and called it worthless and overrated and all of that well its definetly not worthless but it may be a little overrated but beside that this is a really great movie though i wouldnt go as far as to call it an astounishing masterpiece but i would go as far as to say its one of the best movies ive seen in quite some time and is better than harry potter the special effects are dazzling the actors are amazing and i would say that if jrr tolkien were still alive he would be very very proud the only mistake ive made is not seeing it in theaters 
loved the books read them twice really loved the movie they did great job making the movie great cast beautiful scenes great special effects 
i went to the lord of the rings with great expectations i had been waiting for months and months and had been torturing everyone in my family and school with all the new info i got on it i was a little afraid though having read so many reviews and seeing so many specials that i would know every scene to the movie i expected to a see a masterpiece an epic movie awesome on all levels i still dont know what i got it was anything but what i expected it was better i dont know how but it was so different than i imagined sometimes i unfortunately pick out all the lines an actor said wrong or all the scenes the director could have done better too in a case like this i look forward to scenes in the book and when they are edited i am dissapointed in many of my favorite movies i have that feeling quot i love this incredible movie quot but i didnt after seeing the actors talk and all the reviews nothing prepared me for this it was more natural than i thought it would be something funny happened when it came on screen i forgot about the book yikes i forgot about crucial scences that actually caught me by surprise in the movie i never thought an actor did a bad or even a good job i just watched the realistic fantasy unfold with all the people not characters of middle earth it did not seem like a movie at all i am sure you know what the basic plot is but let me just sum it up frodo a hobbit inherits a ring from his odd cousin bilbo bilbos old friend and advisor gandalf the wizard discovers that the ring is the one and only ruler of middle earth it holds powers too horrible to wield so frodo must embark on a journey first to rivendell where he is joined by a fellowship of including him and then to the only place where the ring can be destroyed in the fires of mount doom the scenery obviously is incredible i was so sucked into it all the movie is also wicked funny it rips me apart when they put a hilarious line in a terrifying sad scene in a good way for crying out loud this movie is scary at one point i jumped feet into the air screaming and my heart didnt stop thumping furiously for another minutes another amazing element was the emotion it was horribly sad on some parts i actually cried in a fantasy movie and scenes like when frodo gets stabbed tear up your heart with pity as for the acting it wasnt there the flesh and blood the people in it were elijah wood frodo was so cute and perfect every line he said was thought out true and you could identify with him in even the smallest things ian mckellen gandalf i loved him he could be such a funny wizard with quaint friendships mixed with immense power viggo mortenson aragorn was such a subtle and hardened character he does not let his pride get in his way and his sharp eyes melt to softness when he speaks to arwen speaking of arwen liv tyler was so good she was gorgeous a vision of light who wasnt in the movie as much as everyone feared in fact she was so good i kind of missed her cate blanchette galadriel was even more beautiful than when i had scene her in specials and pictures also she was freaky first she was scary then terrifying then kind and wise wow since were speaking of elves hugo weaving elrond was wonderful in his younger years he looked great and it was so interesting seeing his distrust of men considering he was half human the hobbits ian holm was a perfectly friendly and frightening bilbo and sean austin sam was so wonderful he was not especially bright but he just had this love and loyalty for frodo that no one could ever shake off i really liked merry played by dominic monaghan he was fun loving but a fairly wise hobbit and billy boid pippin was great he was suitably foolish and sometimes just watching his face made you laugh as for the others ill begin with sean beans portrayal of boromir and ill end it there he was so touching proud and pitiable i dont even want to think about it christopher lee saruman had the voice and personality of saruman john rhys davis was a rather funny and feisty dwarf and finally orlando bloom hot hot hot legolas did a remarkable job this quot young quot elf was so amazing he was deadly in battle he is so brave in the sight of most danger and yet when the balrog comes the expression on his face is extremely alarming he is the most scared of all of them save gandalf who is preparing himself for he knows well what a balrog is orlando bloom expresses his emotions through subtle and tender expressions i dont know see it yourself 
the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is a fine movie too bad it didnt win best picture it could have kicked off an oscars run similar to the godfather trilogy alas academy voters have always been blind for instance can somebody please tell me why jackson was not the best director his vision of was the one thing that rose above the bland mire that was last years oscar crop the only other decent movie released during oscar season was the shipping news which oscar completely neglected can someone please show me an actor who gave more to his movie than ian mckellan his gandalf is pure genius who else could have made such a character believable much less likable where oh where has viggo mortensens supporting actor oscar gone these questions left aside there are flaws in the books translation to the screen i still cant see what is gained by having liv tyler rescue frodo poor glorfindel the beginning of the movie while being a wonderful piece of cinematic exposition horribly compresses some things again poor tom bombadil finally i understand this is to be in the quot directors cut quot of the disc dvd but why on earth did they not put gimlis falling in love with galadriel in the publicly released version kind of important for characterization however none of these flaws should really stop someone from watching this great movie there are too many things that are dealt with with excellence the shire jackson has captured the beauty and wonder of the shire and its fascinating hobbits weathertop though this too gets condensed and we lose aragorns all important tale jackson has captured the fight on weathertop just as i had imagined it moria and the fight on the bridge moria is wonderfully imagined gandalfs talk with frodo is another great piece of exposition the flight across the bridge and gandalfs stand against the balrog are scary as can be kate blanchett is perfect as galadriel the two scenes at the end between boromir and aragorn and sam and frodo are as moving as anything thats been on the screen in the past twenty years they leave the viewer waiting expectantly for the next film which is where i am in the meantime i give the lord of the rings the fellowship of the rings my highest recommendation this two disc dvd version has a lot of cool extras but id recommend springing for the four disc version which is going to have a whole lot more 
i am a devoted fan of the books ever since i was a kid and i have one thing to say spot on the movies wonderful and the extended dvd production is probably the only thing that topped it the adaptation of the book to the movie was superbly done you can see that the crew and cast took every aspect of this wonderful novel into the greatest of consideration and really served us the fans and viewers as best they could which was beyond my greatest expectations the fellowship of the ring was very loyal to the book while still serving as an admirable film on its own two thumbs up ive never seen any dvd special edition production done before the amount of dedication and devotion that peter jacksons crew put into it is mind blowing people who love the books and or love film in general would have a true feast in all of the extra material provided first of the film was extended allowing people to get a deeper view on the story and the characters i personally think that every added scene was an improvement and helps us better understand and get into the world and people in it with this version you get about hours in additional material a short documentary on tolkien and the books translating the book into script visualizing the story actually taking you step by step from designing the vast world which is middle earth and showing how the designs later turned into actual set pieces prosthetics makeup wardrobe miniatures armor weapons etc you could sit for hours and watch it over and over again while still discovering something new every time great attention was given to the documentary of the actual production and shooting how things went on on the set the cast and crew emanate such a feeling of devotion on one hand and on the other hand you see how great an experience it was for them even though many of them had to go through a rough time throughout youll see the number of hours the four hobbits had to spend in makeup and youll know what i mean finally you get an extensive coverage on the post production phase special effects music sound effects editing etc in addition to all that the dvds include different commentaries featuring the writers production team design team and cast i loved listening to them all but most especially to the cast apart from being enthusiastic they are all so funny its just hours of sitting down listening to anecdotes and antics pulled on the set i like just putting it on and laughing with the guys wonderful so if you are both a film buff and like the movie itself you are guaranteed hours of sheer pleasure this particular dvd set is the most worn out in my collection 
the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring platinum series special extended edition is by far the best book based movie adaption to date the movie follows the book fairly well considering the complexity of j r r tolkiens masterpieces the extended edition is better than the theater version and has nearly endless amounts of extras the script follows the book well certain parts were totally left out due to their unimportance or in an effort to save screen time even with all the cuts the important areas from the book are still present changes were made at a few parts to make it more exciting and the fighting is expanded all in all the script is great using new zealand as middle earth was the only way this movie would have looked so good new zealands landscapes are so breathtaking it seams as though the movie was actually filmed in middle earth itself all of the cast were carefully selected and there is not a single bad actor i cant think of any one besides sean astin as sam or hugo mortisen as aragorn every last line is said with utmost care and the acting is stunning the sets are amazing hobbiton is so realistic that one would think such a place existed all of the sets are so detailed and extensive that they transport you to middle earth the extended cut of the fellowship also delivers two whole discs of extras that tell everything about the filming and production process this great upgrade to the theatre version is most definately a must have for fans and will certaintly make a great addition to any dvd collection 
i was not especially taken with peter jacksons films but was sufficiently intrigued by them to read the story and wasnt especially swayed by that either tolkeins masterwork is a heavily over written linear episodic chaser providing the context for a devoutly catholic and therefore fairly block headed rumination on good and evil the sort of thing you dont see too often in these post modern times and three cheers for that what did impress me though was tolkiens complete universe of middle earth with its different languages cultures history literature and mythology this is a collossal feat of imagination and erudition and to my mind far outstrips the value of the stories which as i said i found for the most part pretty dull having wathced the extended edition dvd has opened my eyes to peter jacksons equivalent achievement not through a re watching of the film although the additional half hour is a marked improvment but by watching the two quot appendix quot discs dealing with the making of the movie to say jackson and his team especially the weta workshop have an loving eye for detail is to massively understate the efforts they went to to visualise tolkiens middle earth no detail was spared and the pity is that rather like the books much of the effort skill wit and invention will go totally unnoticed by the cinema going public the metalwork and engraving on the elven swords the cultural motifs embedded into the design of the various creatures weapons the architecture of the various cities even the fact that one poor soul at weta spent three years and miles of plastic pipe handmaking chain mail just so the dwarves and hobbits armour looked convincing utterly amazing and it gives me a new found respect for the films this is a labour of love as opposed to a reinterpretation and on that level it is an overwhelming triumph 
i was almost in tears in the theatre at the sheer incredible beauty of this film and how well it adapted it is not a completely literal translation to the screen but that is not possible the epic and mythic novels of tolkien to the screen i cried when gandolf sacrificed himself and fell into shadow my significant other fell asleep not a gender thing per se most of the males in the audience were as enthralled as i i bought a copy and have watched it several times now by myself keep differences in psychology in mind if you want to buy this as a gift for the hard nosed quot realist quot in your life 
im out of words this is simply the best adventure fantasy action movie ive ever watched yes ive read the books yes i know the producers director screenwriters changed a lot of stuff some you can understand or reason why they did it some you have not the slightest idea why they were changed but thats always the same in translating books to screen but in this case we clearly sense that every frame was shot thinking it was the better thing to do it is clear they could not avoid cutting some stuff because after all the trilogy is a product that must generate profits and you could not possibly make a movie more than hours long a movie that does not end if tom bombadil sequence were put on it for example many viewers could possibly think the movie is quot slow quot or something like that i think they did the best handling the artistic commercial interests without one damaging the other the introductory sequence tries brief to explain to ring history and it was a good idea the cast is marvellous the special effects are marvellous i think that those who not read the book can sense the slow transition for the hobbits from an idihlic existence in the shire to a quest that raises and raises in desperation and urgency from second to second viggo mortensen no doubt had the role of his life and he grabbed it with both hands making aragorn the perfect hero the perfect warrior all the cast is marvellous simply put they really put life into the characters well ill stop here ill only say that at some points along the movie i felt tears coming to my eyes and i must make it clear that this not happens very often 
though some people dont want to buy this if they already have the first disc set of the fellowship of the ring on dvd all the extras included with this platinum edition are definetly worth the cost the extra and extended scenes definetly help to complete the film all all the documentaries and interviews definetly help you to see what a huge project these movies really are 
okay so most people dont get it the first time i didnt one might have to know a little about middle earth to get it the first time but i must say once youre hooked youre hooked what may have seemed tedious upon the first view becomes a masterpiece one of the best fantasy movies of all time the scenery is breath taking and the music fits with it perfectly adding such an earth quality the shire is a comfortable homey place where you can snuggle up and that is just the scenery of the beginning of the movie there are mountains underground passageways shrines woods rivers any scenery you can name they have and it is beautifully shot the story itself is epic but shone in a way that it doesnt seem too big at all this movie just doesnt miss a note every moment thats supposed to be emotional is every attempt at humor draws at least a chuckle and there just isnt much to say except that this movie is beautiful well done classic 
the fellowship of the ring is a fantastic cinematic event that outdoes that other fantasy filled movie running alongside it by far jacksons direction is perfect the make up and cg effects are stunning and above all fantastic characters are lifted by some fabulous performances i think that mainly elijah wood and ian mckellen stand out a lot but the breakthrough role will undoubtedly be orlando bloom as the elvin archer legolas i give this film a five because it is undoubtedly one of the most epic and sweeping movies ever made matched only by braveheart for stunning battle sequences and all that we have come to expect from these sorts of movies well done peter jackson i can feel george lucas trembling from here 
this speacial extended addition to the fellowship of the ring really is worth the hype it fills in on what was missing from the thetrical release on areas of the book which deserved there place in peter jacksons lord of the rings epic when i first heard that they where releasing lord of the rings on dvd i thought that it would genrally be an impossible task and would produce a poor movie that didnt do justice to tolkiens books however this version really does do justice to the book and only changes slight areas subtly such as arwens roll is more played upon whilst this may irratate some fans of the book at first it really does adapt with the story and fits in alot better than it would if it remaind strictly true to the book this speacial extended addition includes so many extras on one of the most pre eminent films of all time that it makes you wonder how they keep it so well organized and fit in all the information that it gives you with this addition you got four discs one and two are the extended version of the movie and three and four are all the extras such as how the idea came about how they chose the characters and the settings and genrally all the details about the movie right from the hobbit feet the artwork that you get with this dvd is very well crafted and you get all the original illustrations and storyboards from the film and the discs and cd trays contain some amazing artwork the balrog is the most interesting character adapted from the original storyboard to the final epic which you see in the cinema and on th dvd fortunatley this dvd is not overly pretentious aswell as it does not push the boundries as to what you would like the final output of the film to be like on this extra dvd you will find the appendices which you will probably recollect from tolkiens books these contain the two discs from vision to reality and from book to vision these contain hours of extra featurettes and information its amazing how much work actually went into these films and how strenuous and great it must have been to work on the lord of the rings but it has paid off to become one of the greatest films ever to have been released i would recommened this film to anybody especially those who can actually tolerate long films and not get wrestless as its a rewarding film to get into so if you feel like getting an ambient deep film with its own world stuctures etc and amazing story line then this is one of the quintessential films along with the two towers and the yet to be released return of the king the speacial features do the film justice and the film does the book justice 
that was the cry of my eight year old at the climax of the film myself and nine companions saw this movie tonight and all but my wife what a shock loved it words dont give the picture justice easily an epic on the order of either the phantom menace or ben hur the scenery was incredible the effects phenominal and the acting first rate all round for you old d amp d players you will see how goblins that you can kill with one blow can be so deadly there always seems to be a million of em the movie is very long like the harry potter movie it is also full of plot to keep you from noticing the intermission was helpful but it was very long for a school night for my kids parents should take that into account as for all of us fantasy fans who have lived with subsitiutes or versions either incomplete or with minor animations we can only say oh man 
im not sure exactly what i expected from the extended edition of fotr but imfairly sure whatever my expectations were they were certainly exceeded evenin the introduction there were extra clips of isildur putting the ring on whenattacked by orcs in fact even the placement of the movie title was changed the movie actually opens with bilbo writing his book and then loads of extrafootage from the shire it continues on to the part where frodo meets gandalf but the dialogue is slightly different bilbo is actually narrating a lot of it evidently from his book and the changes are brilliant i didnt even realizehow many loose ends and abrupt scene changes there were in the original fotruntil i saw how they were improved a sampling of a few additions include an extended tavern scene with the hobbits woodelves on the trip to bree hobbits and strider aragorn making their waythrough midge swamp and a lot more a lot of the additions were very minor andhardly noticeable but they improved the flow of the movie as a whole thingslike an extra second of video here or a couple extra words there pulleverything together in a great way the major additions would be in the land of lothlorien there was a lot of extrafootage from the point when the fellowship leaves moria until they get on theriver not only do you get to see galadriel giving the fellowship gifts although sams box of soil seems to have been skipped but you also get tosee aragorn arguing with haldir on a flet and you get to hear a lot moredialogue which closes a lot of loose ends after lothlorien you get to see gollum swimming with his log on the river andyou get to see aragorn and borimir angrily discussing the ring and the paththeyll take ultimately if you had any doubts concerning borimirs motives theyll be extinguished here there were also a few more snippets of fightingin the end with borimirs death the additions to the movie that jackson made were great this release willprobably make a few tolkien purists reconsider the movie and possibly enjoy ita little more a few of the detractions i had about the theatrical version werepretty much taken care of in the original the gifts from galadriel and therelationship between gimli and the elves were sort of missing the actor interviews which actually werent all that enlightening still madethe boxed set fun and interesting all of the dvd extras are amazing i nowknow more about the movies than i ever thought possible i can probablydescribe in great detail how most of the special effects in the movie werecreated this boxed set is worth the few extra dollars even without all the dvd extras the changes in the film itself make it a worthwhile purchase 
the argonath figurines are stunningly handcrafted and heavy the packaging is pure eye candy and the movie inside is a piece of cinematic history a large one extra minutes add significant detail to an already richly imagined world acolytes rejoice this is the one to own 
without repeating the reviews of the rest listed here i can say that the extended editions add more texture to the story and the documentary dvds give you more background and understanding of the story it made me want to read the books to see what the films couldnt touch upon the poetry and descriptions of middle earth are very much on target i really hope that jackson gets the chance to do the hobbit it would be a crime if it wasnt adapted by him in the very near future all i have to say to the film makers is lets see the hobbit before the actors become unavailable to produce the film 
first of all i love the books with all my heart and yes i read them before i saw the movies secondly i think that this first movie is the best as well as the truest to the book in the series as to the complaints by fans of the books artistically and in order to make the movie succesful certain things had to be nudged arwens role is amplified but not terribly so they keep her character excellently well other changes are very subtle and relatively unimportant my biggest qualm about the movie adaptations was that in the extended scene wherin the fellowship is given gifts by galadriel boromir my personal favorite the most complex and human of all the fellowship is the only one who doesnt receive a gift ahem he gets a golden belt for your information pete jackson sir that was quite unfair but overall it follows the book more closely than any other successful movie ive ever seen excepting such classics as the yearling and old yeller which are both much easier to adapt to the screen than tolkiens detailed work this movie is already a classic artisticly made and with wonderful actors 
ive seen the film twice in the theatre have almost finished the book but when i watched this version of the film it smoothed out the rough spots that i felt during my intial viewing with the added scenes and the additions to the sound track it was so much more fulfilling peter jackson has surely demonstrated his love of the quot rings quot story what will be even nicer is when the entire three parts are released and there is a super jumbo seamless film on dvd for all of the ardent followers this version is recommended above the intial dvd release 
i had never read the ring books and didnt see the film in the theater preferring to get it on dvd when it was released in august i thought it was an excellent film and found myself watching it again because theres so much that you miss the first time the dvd of the theatrical release was fine and included a second disc with some good features but after reading reviews here of the difference the additional minutes made in the film itself i had to see for myself i was not disappointed as others have already written this extended edition truly does enhance the film some of the added footage gives meaning to otherwise unclear parts of the theatrical release it definitely provides greater character development the video and audio of the basic version were fine but theyre even better on the new set the dts soundtrack is amazing particularly in the subtle power of the low frequency effects i have really been enjoying the cast commentary the stage name and the character the actor plays are shown on screen each time a cast member speaks which is an excellent idea that should be standard for all multi speaker commentary tracks you can also hear the commentary without the super titles by selecting the appropriate soundtrack through your dvds sound control while viewing the film i havent had a chance to watch any of the material on the bonus discs yet as you can see from the information on amazon com as well as in many of the customeor reviews theres a lot of extra material im sure i will enjoy watching all of it but i bought this set to see the extended version of the film and for that alone it was worth the money if you love this film as much as i do then you must see the extended version 
i just had a total blast watching this movie and on so many different levels it was great simply great to be able to compare peter jacksons sincere vision with my own in my mind he hit it dead on with each and every member of the fellowship even to the point of making it easy to confuse aragorn and boromir i had always visualized goblins orcs and the uruk hai in exactly the same way they are depicted in the film before the brothers hildebrandt and their annual calendars in the late s and s slightly altered my visualization of these hideous creatures the landscapes were a joy and somehow in all substantial ways amazingly close to the way i visualized them as well rivendell looked a bit too much like a swiss chalet though and elrond needed to be much taller but these are minor quibbles jackson really succeeds in recreating the feel of the fellowship of the ring the comaraderie gandalfs love of bilbo and frodo and them for each other sams simple minded determined loyalty frodos crushing burden and the chemistry among the nine perhaps excepting the competition between gimli and legolas are all presented ably and with care what we have here with this movie is clearly a labor of love the filmakers truly wanted to do it right for the most part they succeeded my one problem might lie with the films breakneck pacing in the second half it did occur to me though that this movie will completely blow away anyone who has never read the lotr the ominous portentous prologue featuring an awesome confrontation of armies the hideous gripping visions when frodo puts on the dreaded ring the intense violence and the hanging cut it with a knife tension place this film almost in the horror genre the book however is more leisurely paced filled with exposition descriptions songs and ancient tales in both elven and dwarvish tounges i suppose that a film bringing all such elements to bear might bore some and turn others off with the sheer length that would be required i for one would love every minute of it hopefully there is a directors cut in its embryonic stage containing some of the key missing elements bombadil galadriels gifts a more developed gimli and legolas etc given his audience and economic expectations mr jackson has really done it right tolkien fans everywhere can be grateful while they wait for their next chance to see it again those not familiar with the books can count on a truly awe inspiring and memorable theatrical experience 
no matter what people say about it there are those that think both films are too different from the books or they are simply too long etc it is not in any way a or or star film regardless of your view they are great films notice how the only whiners are people entirely ignorant of the book or entirely religiously devoted to it to any other movie goer all are great having said that after watching them ive read the books and they are better for it none who watch the films should ignore the books for they at the very least improve the movies and at the most are superior to them as the director himself would admit myself knowing his other films well he could never please everyone when turning such great books into film but hes pleased me end of story indeed without the films i may never have read l o t rings and that would be a shame even so i do beleive they will be films best seen as a whole on dvd colection than hours at the cinema not least because of the extended versions 
years ago i read the trilogy repeatedly and wished that someone would have the guts and determination to make a great movie out of it given its size and scope there was a part of me that didnt think it was possible i was proven right initially with the ambitions but failed attempt by ralph bakshi in his cartoon version in the late s so when the peter jackson version came out in the early s i ignored it even after it won numerous academy awards i thought i would be disappointed well over years later i decided to take a peek at it feeling pretty certain that it would not live up to my expectations it turned out that i was wrong beyond words peter jackson the cast crew and technology team have realized the huge vision required to make this movie capture the spirit and depth of the books it does not capture every little detail but for me peter jacksons lord of the rings is what the movie version needs to be like the book it is completely over the top and middle earth frodo gandalf aragon and the whole gang is bigger than what most people can imagine them to be the star wars and harry potter series are great but this is this is the one trilogy to rule them all 
the merits perfect casting breathtaking special effects used to enhance the great plot and not to disguise the lack of one best adaptation from a book ever even taking account of the necessary changes artistic viability and commercial viability of the project walk hand on hand reverence and honesty to tolkien and its fans without lacking efforts to introduce the movie also to laymen in tolkiens terms as the introductory sequence proves perfect costume design perfect cinematrography passionate direction the flaws none i think producers of things like mi and planet of the apes should see this movie to learn how to shoot a real adventure action film 
unless youre a tom bombadil obsessed tolkien purist freak its impossible to not be enchanted enthralled and amazed by this movie that is inarguably a cinematic masterpiece on par with the likes of godfather and citizen cane i have never recommended a movie more highly 
as a longtime tolkein reader i was both thrilled and terrified when i heard that a film trilogy was finally going to be made of the lord of the rings thrilled because lotr is such a wonderful work of literature terrified because i didnt want to see it ruined i neednt have worried peter jackson exceeded all of my highest hopes with this the first film in the trilogy and then with the release of this dvd set he exceeded even the theatrical version this chapter in the lotr saga perfectly sets the table for what is to come i wont re tell the story here for the sake of space but every aspect of the story and the film is sheer perfection it should have swept the academy awards just as return of the king did the dvd packaging is handsome and definitely deluxe it is no mere hype to call it the platinum edition the disc quality is warm and rich and the extra footage adds greatly to the experience a must have for every film library 
my god ive never read the books but after seeing this im going to this is without doubt the best film i have ever seen everything else pales in comparison with it seen harry potter if so forget it that film is just plain bad when compared to this piece of cinematic mastery a party of students from our school were able to see the film today as a christmas quot treat quot i had gone with trepidation thinking it might be boring fantasy not being my thing but my my my i was wrong this film is anything but boring it was fantastic you all have to go and see it its highly highly reccomend i cant actually think of a bad thing to say about it it outshines almost every single film ive ever seen the film is almost indescribable the acting is superb no one character is any better than the next it is a brilliant film which is the gigantic sum of all its wonderful parts everything about it is stunning a nice thing about it is that it doesnt feature too many well known stars save from the sublime christopher lee so we dont have anything to compare their acting to the wonderful scenery and breathtaking special effects are just that breathtaking the film has left images with me which i wont forget in a hurry in fact the scenery and special effects are so brilliant and such a part of the film as to almost become a living breathing seperate character it is nothing short of stunning you have to see it if you only see one film this year make it the lord of the rings part if you only see two films this year watch it again 
i dont usually review movies but i have to pay tribute to peter jacksons impressive film version of lotr jackson and his team have exercised unusual talent and intelligence in bringing lotr to the screen jackson and his co writers made a number of changes in the plot mainly deleting some subplots and minor characters these choices were made very well not sacrificing any of the dramatic integrity of the story and are really necessary for keeping a movie even a part film with long individual components within reasonable commerical bounds jacksons team is remarkably faithful to tolkiens vision their realization of many of the most important setpieces within the books is remarkable most important of all jackson and his team have really been faithful to tolkiens moral vision lotr is a story about the virtues of courage and decency and the need to and costs of resisting evil the lotr films with excellent performances from the entire cast capture this very well jackson has done a particularly good job of making the ring of power itself a protagonist in the film this insidious source of evil and corruption is the real villain of the piece tolkiens opposition of the pull of the ring against frodos quiet moral courage is tremendous moral drama which jackson has brought to the fore of his movies 
yes the cinematic benchmark for the st century both versions on one disc very good idea well only if you dont have them already if you dont this is for you and you can stop reading fans however already own all the versions of these movies the new documentary no matter how excellent raw and real it may be will get one viewing better for renting the only reasons for buying this are if you plan to view the documentaries more than once or if you are an obsessive collector of all things related to these movies dont get me wrong i am a huge fan i preordered every dvd on the first day i could i dont doubt that next year they will release an hd dvd or blu ray version possibly both that will be entirely worth having until then i will wait to give them more money not now 
well well when you thought you had seen it all peter jackson restores minutes of footage into the theatrical cut of the film which gives the already hour long film a total running time of around hours for those that complain that the theatrical release was too long then you need not bother with this version because the fight scenes are longer as well as the expository scenes but just a thought to those who said that a hour movie is too long you better stick to the scorpion kings out there because it takes a serious film viewer to appreciate long epic movies actually i wished the movie was longer but then again thats why peter jackson spread this epic tale out into three films but anyway i was one of those people who went into the theater wondering what to expect i sat there and really tried to like the film but alas i couldnt not that because i was dissappointed byt the pace of the film well sort of but because i have never read the books but then comes the dvd first the disc version in aug and then the disc extended version in nov well ill have to say the the more and more i watch it the more and more i absolutely love the film watching the extras helps alot too if youre not familiar with the story or tolkiens world then the extras will lay that out for you one of the most interesting featurettes was the minute quot cameras of middle earth quot special this was basically a behind the scenes quot making of quot documentary very cool to watch another was the cast of middle earth a series of interviews and candid response session of each cast member it was comedic as well the comments by the quot hobbits quot were extremely hysterical at times the added and extended scenes in this disc version add a tremendous amount of insight to the story some scenes are added dialogue that may explain something a little better others are extended battle sequences one very apparent extended battle scene was the orc and cave troll fight in the mines of moria one added scene which the production crew hated to cut in the first place was the gift giving scene in lothlorien this scene is important as it shows things that appear in the next two subsequent films one of the coolest features of this disc set is the case in which it comes in the case looks like a worn leather book and so when and if surely that the two towers and the return of the king will get the same treatment youll have a nice looking book film on dvd 
jrr tolkien author of the lord of the rings was a master at evoking the imagination most readers of his books probably have certain mental images of middle earth and its characters i certainly did a film depiction of such well loved books thus could easily fall short in many ways i was ready to be disappointed but im happy to report the filmakers of fellowship of the ring have done an excellent job in bringing the story to life on screen most of the characters and places are well as i imagined they would be and even though its been a long time since i read it the story was easy to follow and well covered in the film no small feat since fellowship of the ring is a fairly long book it seems those who havent read the book might have some trouble following the characters and the plot but i dont know how it couldve been done better as mentioned the players are well done particularly the ringwraiths chilling black creatures the elves elegant the dwarfs down to earth the wizards saruman on top of his tower he and gandalf conjuring and the hobbits loveable homebodies the nature scenes and the vistas are fabulous having said that some things were perhaps a bit overdone the balrog and the year ago sauron were mere animations think how older films by contrast would create imaginary things out of very little a computer drawn creature leaves little to imagine the orcs were too monsterous and too complex in their form overall i felt a bit of sensory overload with all the extended fighting scenes a little less might have been more effective in the very last scene frodo and sam look toward mordor i might have expected a darker more forbidding view but maybe they are still far away this film makes me look forward to watching two towers will we see gollum long ago when he was still a man 
first of all id like to say that i had no hopes for this movie yes i am a tolkien fan and im only but own all tolkiens books but really think about the dune movie that was trash well when the fellowship of the rings review came out in entertainment weekly i became enthralled an a best movie of the year and after seeing it twice i have to say im not seeing any other movies this year the charecters the scenerey the total feel for the movie was excellent though things were cut no tom bombadil the movie establishes itself well even from the first scene with the introduction playing out the universe of middle earth the director is setting out to tell everyone the story of the one ring of power especially to those who have not read tolkiens books and it begins that story with excellence go see this movie is the bottom line 
the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring was truly an amazing film one thing that i thought the filmmakers did right was that they did not try to cram all three books into one long movie instead they filmed the fellowship of the ring the two towers and the return of the king separately also they did not try to release all three films at once they spred out the release of each part now back to the fellowship of the ring ive read all three novels and i have to say that they left out some major parts of the book in tfotr of course i knew that if they tried to film the whole book then it would have been way too long probably over five hours or so so i guess they wanted to narrow down the timing of the film still tfotr was absolutely stunning even if you have read the books and know what happens it is still a pleasure to see there are many visual computerized special effects in the fellowship of the ring and they are all simply breathtaking hollywood keeps getting better and better with special effects each year thanks to the technology of computers if they tried to make this into a movie or so years ago it never would have turned out to be as successful or as brilliant the entire cast so far does incredibly well they are all superb and flawless some of those acting highlights to watch for include elijah wood quot frodo baggins quot sean astin quot sam gamgee quot ian mckellen quot gandalf quot and viggo mortensen quot strider quot the fellowship of the ring is not just a movie but its a life experience the script is solidly written the movie starts out a little slow but once they go off on the journey to destroy the ring the film starts to pick up and it doesnt seem as slow i already cannot wait for the two towers and the return of the king i am highly anticipating the await for those films also i think the lord of the rings will turn out to be a great dvd when it is time for a dvd release think of all the special features they could add to this trilogy one of the best motion pictures of and a classic film of the st century go see the fellowship of the ring when you leave the theater you will be wanting more 
i finally saw this movie when it came out to the local theatre ive been a fan of the hobbit and lord of the rings since i was itty bitty when i first watched the animated movies now being that i was more familar with the hobbit and the return of the king i looked to this movie with interest as i had never known about the first two parts of the story even though i knew that certain characters would survive and what would happen to them i was very worried about frodo and his fellow men as they began their journey the effects of this movie are amazing i would have rather sat through an nine hour movie rather than ending abruptly but even i was getting restless the movie doesnt include every aspect of the book but then it really would be too long i must say peter jackson has done a marvelous job and i cant wait to see the following two movies 
when my daughter and i went to the lord of the rings she and i were both very skeptical about the film we both thought it would be terrible almost like the book made movie pet cemetary by stephen king that didnt turn out very well the acting was wonder full and i thought that the actors chosen to portray the characters were perfect for their roles the scenery was stunning and the music was fantastic i even bought the soundtrack p i would recommend this movie to anyone that has read the book and has an open mind 
there have already been so many reviews and discussions about this vervion of lotr that i have nothing else to add i mearly want to point out that for those of us who purchased receivers for our home entertainment systems this is the movie to get under sound selections you will find dts ex and that is what you want to be able to find each and every movie you purchase naturally you wont but if you ever wanted to show off your sound system this is the movie to do it with 
you dont need to be a lord of the rings fan or a tolkien reader to enjoy this film and appreciate it as a masterpiece i had skimmed the fellowship of the ring by tolkien a year or two before the theatrical release because of the popularity of the novels i am not an avid reader so i only remembered a few story points and descriptions i am also not a big movie person and despite seeing some parts of the fellowship of the ring i had not viewed the film from beginning to end figuring it was about time i went with the go big or go home philosophy and bought the extended version if the story and the film are such masterpieces why not it did not disappoint in the least the storyline down to the last detail is captivating the environments are amazing and the action scenes are top notch the film is long this extended version is about hours but if you enjoy the story and dont worry about catching every amazing detail it will be an experience the split discs also make it possible to view roughly half the movie without worrying about where you left off and the discs split at a perfect spot to take a break while lord of the rings fans dont need to be told again those who havent bothered will not regret seeing this film for those looking for an action movie more than a storyline this will be among the best youve ever seen i hear the others in this trilogy surpass it even though action fans may want to pick up the theatrical release and save themselves over a half hour of what is probably mostly non action as well as a few dollars the appendices discs and of this collection are also somewhat interesting while die hard fans will love the features speaking as a first time viewer i also found what i dipped into somewhat interesting im convinced that theres no chance a story this rich and deep will ever be written in my lifetime it amazes me how j r r tolkien created such a masterpiece when todays authors are usually proud of getting their work turned into a cheap documentary or womens television movie i was not a fan of king kong but peter jacksons adaptation of lord of the rings while seeming to follow a similar formula definately produced a classic 
its bilbo baggins ian holm th birthday and everyone has come to celebrate gandalf the grey ian mckellen has come specially to set off an amazing set of fireworks but bilbo has a secret hes spent too many years at bag end and now he wants to have one last adventure like some i havent been a lifetime tolkien fan i read fellowship of the rings just before the movie came out in i usually like the book better from the beginning i was lost if new zealands scenary doesnt take your breath away the set enhancements acting effects and musical score should its rare that casting is so spot on that the actors face is stuck in my mind as i continue to read the books yet this film actually brings what i imagined to life im not a person who owns a lot of dvds because i find i dont want to repeat view a lot of things lord of the rings is one set i can watch again and again every time ive seen the films theres some different detail ive missed from previous viewings this is definitely a must have for fantasy fans 
i must admit for starters that i had never read lord of the rings or the hobbit having a well versed background and sci fi one would think that i would have naturally gravitated toward it most of my early reading when i was a teen was spent trying to forget the drudgery of the rather lackluster selections made for me by the new haven public schools but i digress simply put if i had known lord of the rings was this good i would perhaps be a more advid reader to this day bringing a story of this magnitude was no easy task to say the least now having read the original material i can honestly say that this is probably what j r r tolkien envisioned when he first concieved this epic tale it was said that back in the s stanley kubrick was first presented with the offer to make a film rendition of the lord of the rings but passed it up saying that it would never translate into a movie it took years and the vision of director peter jackson to make him eat those words this is about as good a movie as you are going to see this year at least until lotr the two towers is released the film tells the tale of frodo baggins a hobbit from the shire in the realm of middle earth frodo is left to him by his uncle bilbo among other things a ring little does he know that this small and seemingly ingsifiicant item would hold the fate of an entire world now ive heard some people complain that this is not a complete movie and to their credit they are right this is only the first part of a trilogy remember all those commercials that said the trilogy begins simply put this movie will set a new standard for the action adventure genre many film critics and historians often point out that george lucas borrowed many aspects for his star wars trilogy from lord of the rings now peter jackson brings it back full circle 
i couldnt be more pleased with the extended versions of the lord of the rings trilogy everything they included made the story better and clearer thank goodness they did this i couldnt be happier with all of t hem 
this film version of the first volume of j r r tolkeins lord of the rings will disappoint only the most hardcore tolkein literalists who wont accept even a single word being changed and who probably wouldnt be content with anything short of a hour long mini series for the rest of us seeing this film will be a remarkably immersive moving and impressive experience despite the fact that the series is incomplete as i write this the return of the king comes out this coming fall i have to place this on my official list of my favorite movies in the interests of full disclosure i will add that i am not what one would consider a tolkein fanatic i read the entire series in college and later when my daughter was three years old i read her the trilogy aloud i consider it to be a good but hardly great work of literature the movie does so many things so well it is difficult to know where to begin one has i suppose to begin with the art and set design i have never seen a film that paid so much attention to detail the design of the tiniest objects onscreen appears to have been labored over the jewelry for instance is both striking and unique i especially like the clasps the fellowship wear on the elvin cloaks the effort expended on the jewelry is typical of everything else the make up the furniture design the boats the weapons absolutely everything that appears onscreen seems to have emerged from another world and from the most dedicated crafts persons technically the film is a marvel the photography the cgi scripting the myriad of special effects is all very close to perfect one never is bothered or disturbed or skeptical by the presence onscreen of the hobbits and humans and dwarves other aspects of the production such as the photography and music and sound are also done about as well as is possible the casting is impeccable ian mckellan is perfect as gandalf my favorite character from the novels viggo mortensen is a fine strider aragorn elisha wood still even after the first two films completely won me over but it doesnt hurt the film as a whole orlando bloom and john rhys davies are great as an elf and dwarf respectively most of the rest of the cast is rock solid i was especially pleased to see ian holm who voiced frodo in the famed radio version of lord of the rings portray bilbo christopher lee who is not only a tolkein fanatic but is the only member of the cast to have actually met tolkein does his usual capable job of being evil as saruman my only real disappointment in the film as im sure it was to many who have read the novels was the decision to not include tom bombodil unquestionably the most important character in the novels to be excluded the tom bombodil sequence is one of the most delightful in the trilogy and provides both a break in the long journey to the elves and is crucial in making the journey feel long and eventful as a result in the movie that journey seems to take considerably less time than in the novel i know that not every detail or scene in the novel could make its way into the movie but that was one that i especially lament besides tom is such an outrageous character it would have been delightful to see how they would have portrayed him otherwise i have no major complaints with the film most scenes and events are portrayed anywhere from adequately to spectacularly i especially loved the way they handled how the world looked whenever frodo put on the ring 
after the phantom menace fiasco i attempted to keep my excitement to a minimum this movie however did not dissapoint the fellowship of the ring succeeds on every level and i refuse to attempt to find fault in this movie i recently read the book and do not hold the view that the movie should have included every line word for word the only question i found asking myself was pertaining to the gifts that all the hobbits were to receive i actually welcomed the faster pacing and elimination of the songs if anything was to be eliminated for time constraints the easy choice was tom bambadil if your a purist the book is always there this is definately one of the greatest movies ever made if not the greatest due to the fact that all three movies were filmed at the same time i feel that fans can expect the same outstanding quality in all three this is unlike most trilogies where there is a drop off in quality after the first and there is less than a year wait until the next movie my thanks to peter jackson for giving me the fantasy movie i have always wanted to see 
available on dvd since august in a straight theatrical transfer this new lavish four disc set raises the bar for content and packaging the film itself is an expanded minute version of the much praised award winning adaptation of j r r tolkeins beloved novel that has not been previously seen in theaters or on dvd in addition there are four audio commentaries and six hours of documentaries and other never before seen bonus features lotr is an extraordinary first segment in the potent moral trilogy that explores the dark seductive lure of obtaining power through occult means and the destructive grip that lust for power alone eventually has on the souls it possesses the first two discs are the movie and terrific commentaries the third disc is from book to vision the fourth disc is from vision to reality the extras are too lengthy to mention in detail here but be assured they cover almost everything youd ever want to know about creating and shooting this opulent eye filling new zealand production of tolkeins epic vision of light and darkness and free will highest recommendation 
finally over years after the lord of the rings was first published this literary classic or at least the first part of it is given justice on the big screen this is indeed a movie classic that everyone should go and see the plot is consistent and detailed leaving no important leaving no blank spots and never seems rushed which is where its counterpart harry potter and the sorcerers stone failed to add to this the acting was phenomenal ian mackellan as gandalf and sean bean as borrimir were the top of a magnificent acting crop who each performed their roles to near perfection and i would think peter jackson should win a trophy or two for his stunning directing skills skills that are evident throughout the movie then there is an emotionally stirring soundtrack that sets the perfect mood for every mood as for the special effects well eye popping is the understatement of the year there really isnt anything that ive said that hasnt been said already hundreds of people have given positive reviews for this movie and theyre all right whatever they say this is a brilliant movie and certainly one of the best in years if you are not blown away by this movie there is something definetely wrong with you so lets make some numbers plot stars its lord of the rings so you know its brilliant plot handling stars cheers to peter jackson for doing his job perfect to every detail acting stars frodo gandalf and borrimir lead a pack of actors who performed at their peak special effects stars an excellent combination of camera work atmosphere and cgi get the job done soundtrack stars a wonderfully done piece of work with a heart warming tear forcing enya track overall a perfect not only a classic of but a classic for all time and not just in literature anymore see it today 
peter jacksons stunning st installment of the lord of the rings saga is certainly the most rousing beautiful examples of great movie making in the last ten years it will definately stand as one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking of the st century certainly a labor of love for all involved it shows what can be done when a filmization of a novel is given to a great director jackson of heavenly creatures fame and an excellent cast sean bean as the honorable but corrupted boromir and ian mckellan as the always dependable gandalf stand out in a cast of great performances this is a film that takes you completely to another place and time and does it with complete believability and instills everything with what a fantasy film needs most conviction if you are going to see any film this winter see lord of the rings 
 the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring may be a big budget epic but its got the heart and soul of a well crafted indie thats a thesis that ive been considering ever since i first saw the film in december and actively propounding ever since i saw it a second time in february as rich and beautiful and visually mesmerizing as this first adaptation of the j r r tolkien trilogy may be its most valuable asset is both immeasurable and increasingly rare in hollywood filmmaking restraint its a quality you certainly wont find hiding within the schlocky morass of half realized sentiments and outright lies that is a beautiful mind which inexplicably beat lord of the rings for the academy award the jokes on dreamworks they may loft and embrace every one of their four undeserved trophies but at the end of the day a beautiful mind is just another dusty relic on the shelf of forgotten best picture winners lord of the rings which isnt a year old and has already attained classic status moves on to a higher pedestal hiring jackson has made all the difference watch his psychological thriller heavenly creatures and then watch this film youll notice the same virtues masterful pacing a tremendous visual imagination a genuine curiosity about character and of course restraint in spite of the million budget lord of the rings doesnt feel like a million movie it has its sweeping panoramic flourishes and its eye popping battle sequences but theyre integrated so unobtrusively and with such enormous fluidity that they feel absolutely inseparable from the story that story of course is well known frodo elijah wood that gentlest of hobbits has the most unenviable task of destroying the one ring which seems capable of corrupting anyone or anything including the camera jackson focuses his lens on the ring so unnervingly that it assumes the magnetism of a full fledged villain aiding frodo in his quest are the wizard gandalf ian mckellen and the seven other members of the eponymous fellowship in an age of cynicism theres nothing more difficult to take seriously than a fantasy epic how lord of the rings manages to be so effortlessly convincing and so unembarrassing in spite of its proliferation of pointy hats and funny cloaks is hardly the least of its miracles the idea of gandalf glaring into the fiery face of a balrog and screaming you shall not pass at the top of his lungs inspires a groan on paper mckellen acting at the height of his powers turns it into one of the most singularly riveting scenes of the year thats ultimately what makes lord of the rings so thoroughly resonant and refreshing behind the stylistic ingenuity and pitch perfect ensemble it has a very real sense of the human consequences of evil and despite the pg rating there are scenes here that can and will make you squirm in terror not just the kind of terror that has you cowering in your seat but also the kind that fills you with a positive thrill of gratitude that real drama and real magic are still alive and well at the movies heres to the next two 
 gave birth to the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring ending off the year with a slam bang of a major wham and starting off the next year with the anticipation for the next chapter in the trilogy the same pattern can be said for the following year but for those next two years though the frustrations of waiting and compulsive disorder of being antsy was considerably high the surprise factor slightly diminished we all knew the next one wouldnt suck and would be equally amazing or even surpass the one preceding it though the fear of seeing a star wars redux was nigh to the heavens above we all knew subconsciously peter jackson would never ever make a mistake much like what george lucas did to the prequels so one great thing that i can say about the fellowship of the ring that i cant say about the next two that would come after it is that different kind of surprise factor that feeling of oh my gawd i didnt know this is going to be utterly and freakingly cool nobody expected how amazing the whole lotr trilogy was going to be let alone contemplating how mind blowing the first was going to be but that was exactly it from the get go jackson had already cemented the makings of classic cinema and boy did he ever i was amazed and enthralled and on the edge of my seat during the long span in the darken theater the smell of buttered popcorn licorice and whiff of the misty cool ac in the air added a priceless element to the wide eyed span of the equally mesmerized audience and the almost uncomfortable silence of hearing a pin drop not a cell phone could be heard nor a childs cry disrupting the engagement it was like a community sharing something spectacular a communal feeling that no words could articulate that is something that i will truly miss as bitterness and sadness continues to plug my sensitive heart knowing that from now on there will never be any lotr movies in december anymore meticulously done with passion love and commitment for its source satisfying the fans of the book the geeky movie fanatics who havent read the books and the average joe six pack all at the same time its a big budget blockbuster movie with a bigger heart that can usually only be found in independent films peter jackson created a juggernaut of a milestone in recent cinema that will leave a lasting and permanent impression seven samurai or gone with the wind for our kids years from now an artifact of todays time that well always be looking back and experiencing the feelings it initially evokes an art to be always admired and a guideline for many aspiring directors to draw inspirations from faithful to the writings of j r r tolkien while sacrificing and tinkering some notable but not overly crucial events for the benefits of a different medium not single qualm coming from me although some tolkien fans may disagree jackson made a tapestry of a long overdue vision of a one true fan the world of middle earth and its inhabitants from the shire the miniscule hobbits gandalf the grey the balrog the ringwraiths down to the costumes horses and even hair and make up you name it he got it and all created in fantastic picture perfect detail its as if he knew what youve been conjuring up in your imagination all these years and just effortlessly transferred them on to a different canvas of course it tremendously helped that he a opted for new zealand as a setting and b chose weta digital a non hollywood company to supervised the visual effects the result is never a bombastic garish and cold special effects overdrive that usually plagues todays blockbuster movies but a perfect combination of the flawless hard beaten realism and delicate ethereality with a timeless ancient quality to it the music by howard shore arguably his best work ever brings the whole concoction to a perfect notch stirring passionate emotional with great usage of choir angelic vocals and every instruments well except for electric guitar imaginable its never fluff but as heavy and involving as the story unfolding on the screen its marriage made in heaven the track called the breaking of the fellowship is powerfully heartbreaking and never ceases to bring a tear or two in fact i am crying right now sniff the direction of the movie is flawlessly articulate the camera swoops and glides and flies not a tool anymore but a part of the world along with the characters fast and furious in action sequences but intimate and personal in dramatic moments there is that counterbalance that exists between the loud and the quiet the brawns and the brains and the heart in this movie and so forth throughout the rest of the trilogy that tragically doesnt exists at all in todays blockbuster movies even so like spider man and hellboy they can never top the mixture that the lotr laid out the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring ranks on my list as cinema in its pure perfection this is not just fantasy at its finest folks but a serious blockbuster movie with a heart and soul for the thinking man of course rolled into one along with the following next chapters is heaven overkill the oscars won always be remembered for its clean sweep for the return of the king rightly deserves their places on peter jacksons shelves as a standalone movie it is enough to juggle my inner geek to the core and i never cease coming back for more thus ill be going now for another fix toodles 
i was amazed when i left the theater after seeing the fellowship of the ring peter jackson and his crew have done the best job on the classic novel by j r r tolkien the scenery the characters the geographical locations in new zealand and everything in this movie was done with such precision and effort that i smiled every time i saw something that i loved in the book actually appear before my eyes this is easily in my own opinion the best quality film that i have ever seen let me get something straight the lord of the rings is my all time favorite novel and i was really hoping that peter jackson his crew and the characters wouldnt screw up on the first part of the best fantasy saga ever written they didnt from the first minutes of the film i was drawn in to the world that i know and love so much the geographical locations and the sets in new zealand were breathtaking and were crafted and found oh so well the characters that were casted for this movie were the absolute best every charcter that was presented in this film was just as i had imagined the charcter from the book frodo aragron gimli legolas and everyone else that played a role in this film did a superb job a lot of har work was put into the making of this film and every last drop of it was worth it the action in this film is like the pages of the actual book just came to life peter jackson really made this movie from the actual book unlike other movies that were originally books with the academy awards coming up i truly hope that this film takes home all of the gold it really deserves it the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring was probably the best movie i have ever seen in my life i dont say that just because the lord of the rings is my all time favorite novel but because of the sheer perfection that came with this movie i smiled seeing something from the book appear on screen this is a movie that youll watch again and again all in all totally recommended i cant wait for this film to come out on dvd and for the two towers and the return of the king to hit theaters in late and watch this movie i guarantee that youll love it 
this is a spectacular film i saw this back in december by accident actually i was planning on seeing the just released the royal tenenbaums and had disregarded this as a slow boring film for fans of the books of which i had never bothered to read i couldnt have been more wrong i went up to the ticket booth only to find that the movie i was going to see was sold out i surveyed the other options eliminating them one by one until i came to the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring i had seen almost all the other films and finally decided to see lord of the rings i figured if nothing else i could see what all the hype was about so i paid my money ouch and headed into the theater well i thought to myself as i watched the new star warstrailer it would appear that the next star wars movie is going to be all love story i was wrong again as i found out later lord of the rings started playing and from scene one galadriel telling the story of the ring thus far if you remember i was hooked the fascinating storytelling kept me engulfed inside another world middle earth in fact the magnificent cinematography and terrific art direction had my eyes riveted to the screen for every single second of film the spellbinding score was perfect for each and every scene not one note was wrong or misplaced the direction was fantastic and the acting which has received some grief somehow or another was perfect every line was said with perfection nothing wooden in any of the actors performances the movie ran for around three hours which was amazing to me because when i walked out it had felt like two hours at best i would have sat there and watched the entire trilogy with only a small bathroom break in between if i could have after seeing the movie i rushed here to my computer and got online to amazon com and bought the entire lord of the rings set and the hobbit and have thus far read the hobbit the fellowship of the ring and am currently reading the two towers which i plan on finishing before the first dvd release of lotr next month i went out and saw the fellowship of the ring when the two towers trailer was packaged with it and loved the movie just as much as ihad when i first saw it if not more so now there has been somecontroversy over leaving out and changing some of the original story in the book for the movie i can tell you now that this movewithout a doubt kept the film going and never slowed to the pace that it would have slowed to had tom bombadil been included i thought the parts with tom bombadil were the slowest in the book and i for one am glad that they were excluded the other scenes such as the deeply moving gift giving scene i have heard will be included in the november special extended edition dvd release with new music scored by new academy award winner howard shore and will be contained on two discs with two more discs for over hours of special features i am planning on getting the collectors editionof that dvd that also includes a national geographic beyond the movie dvd and several other lord of the rings items but until then i am awaiting the two towers due out december th i also can tell you that the very overrated a beautiful mind should have lost best picture in favor of the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring i just realized that its tuesday which means that this dvd comes out two weeks from today yipee yahoo horray yes terrific spectacular magnificent my precious will soon be mine 
in our family some are big fans of tolkien some didnt care for the books this film managed to delight both camps as for me i started the movie fully expecting to walk away and find something else to do because i easily get turned off bored by action movies and violence this time i was glued to the screen for the whole hours although there are violent scenes the editing is so skillful that i never got to my usual ok i get the point move on this movie is worth watching for the sets alone this movie is worth watching for the acting alone this movie is worth watching for the editing alone this movie is worth watching for the cinematography alone when you put them all together its a wonderful experience oh yeah and the story works too 
by necessity the creators left out many details of the book yet they have done an amazing job of conveying rich textures and flavors in music scenery costumes props the creative commitment to communicate core qualities of tolkiens story impressed me immensely i dont think it would have been humanly possible to make a better film of it communication between the characters is seemless and completely believable ian mckellen as gandalf and sean bean as boromir get my academy award nominations for the complexity of character they were able to convey 
we are big fans of the hobbit and lord of the rings we needed another part of the story so we bought this digital copy glad we did everything about this movie is awesome 
after countless movies that i gave so many simpathy votes to in the only movies that i actually thought was worth it to go see being lord of the rings now i can understand some people just plain hated the movie cause how it appeals to a curtain audiance my mom honestly thought it was a stupid movie but she was expecting a harry potter type of movie to see most of the people who liked it were either fans of the books or wanting to see something better than the hobbit and lord of the rings cartoons knowing me i go to anything and i can either say it or it rocks but lotrpt grasped me throughout the entire hrs it had a sense of style by the direction of the very talanted peter jackson it follows through from beginning to end but leaving a very mysterious ending to the next of the trilogy the two towers part may not be better than the book but it carries out cause no movie i have seen has ever taken an entire book and put every detail to it so i try to pretend its somewhat else than what the book has to offer there is high hopes for part cause of its graphics that are times better that the original star wars including the special edition and who said lord of the rings cannot be made into a movie i know some people who say part is better that harry potter but i tend to say it appeals to other audences harry potter was on my list harry potter is the wizard of oz of our time damn those christain group who really dont know what they are actually saying about harry potter and lord of the rings is the next star wars and some day lord of the rings will be those cult classics that at our video rental stores that are never there i think if new line is doing well with theater box office wait until video part was so good i cant wait for the second half 
including the extra scenes this movie totals a hefty playing time of hours and minutes having seen the movie without the extra scenes i can fully say that these extra scenes pull the movie together like you wouldnt expect i absolutely guarantee that you will say to yourself i cant believe that scene was deleted that explains everything get this movie over the non extended edition you wont be disappointed 
i was so speechlees during the entire hours that when the movie was over i realized that almost the entire left side of my body had fallen asleep the scenary was beautiful to look at the music was perfectly scored along with the mood of the movie and the plot though rather thick was easily followed for those who are unfamiliar with the lord of the rings as i was i received the trilogy of books for christmas and after seeing this movie i am already almost finished the two towers and am preparing to hand it over to my sister and father who are just dying to get a hold of it after im finished with it i cant wait to see the sequel next christmas i just hope its as well done as fellowship was the only downside to the movie is that i personally feel the rating is a little overlooked this movie in my mind should have been rated r the only reason it wasnt was because there was no vulgar language but the brutal violent scenes and the screaming and screeching of the orcs black riders had already taken their tolls on some pre and early teens sitting behind me before the first hour of the movie was finished if you are a parent of a child i would advise seeing this movie first before exploiting them to the tense visuals and loud verbals theyll see in this movie other than that i do believe that this is a movie that all mature and desenstised minds can enjoy from all angles and i recommend every stable minded person to see it 
this movie is an immediate classic of a caliber and quality of filmmaking rarely seen when adapting literature to the big screen the lord of the rings novels written by j r r tolkien are immense in their scope with multiple plots and an armys worth of principal characters it seemed that adapting these novels to film would be nearly impossible if any justice to the original stories was to be served it has been done this platinum series extended edition of quot the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring quot is a masterpiece of modern filmmaking this edition of the film which runs approximately hours in length captures everything important about tolkiens first installment in the ring series in this film we are introduced to frodo baggins elijah wood nephew of bilbo baggins and future quot heir quot to the ring of power by no choice of his own frodo is sent on a quest to take the ring of power to the elf city where it can be kept safe against the growing power of mordor who seeks to possess the ring aided by the powerful wizard gandalf ian mckellan a mysterious soldier known as strider and a band of loyal hobbits frodo begins his quest which will ultimately lead him to the heart of mordor where he must attempt to destroy the ring of course this synopsis does the film absolutely no justice the film which has the feel of a true epic is full of rich characters beautiful scenery incredible special effects and enough plots and sub plots to keep anyone entertained even when viewing the film multiple times the settings are incredibly beautiful especially the elvish city set in a valley full of waterfalls and lust vegitation the story behind the filming of this film is also fascinating and in this special edition dvd set there are two appendices disks included with hours of production material including how the director attempted to faithfully recreate each character and situation from the books using much state of the art special effects technology to transport the viewer to quot middle earth quot with a feeling that what they are viewing is completely real for parents considering this movie for their children there are a few moments in the film which might be somewhat unsettling to younger viewers the orcs and goblins are frightening in their appearance there is little blood in this film despite the many battle sequences overall the film is a powerfully positive experience for any viewer young or old and should be able to be enjoyed by the entire family this dvd set which contains disks in all is truly a worthwhile collection to own for anyone who is an avid fan of the original novels it should be noted that some material contained in tolkiens fellowship novel are missing and others have been changed some to make the film more linear but these changes in no way detract from the essence of tolkiens story and even the most dedicated tolkien fan should enjoy this film immensely 
i ignored this film for a year i just was never a fan of the saga of middle earth and even now i probably wont be reading the books anytime soon but dang this was an awesome spectacle and a beautiful film the characters were well drawn and the action nearly non stop was it faithful to the book i dont know and sure dont care it was a fine picture the best fantasy epic ive ever seen harry potter needs to go home this is real fantasy not the flavor of the month even if you dont like fantasy films see this picture 
what makes the extended addition of the fellowship so great is that it contains so many small but important scenes from the book that were left out of the original version jackson does an excellent job of integrating simple yet important details into the movie without dragging it down or becoming redundant for everyone who complains that this still isnt true to the book nothing is perfect but as far as a literary adaptation to the big screen i think this version gets very high scores sure tom bombadil was left out but it would have been really difficult i think to make those scenes work in the movie some of the extras that i like are the scenes between frodo and gandalf explaining the origins of the ring of power and giving more detail into gollums history in addition i think the scenes with the elves are excellent especially the distributing of the gifts to the nine and the scene where gimli falls in love with galadriel everyone should purchase this edition of the movie because of all the extras it contains and the way it brings the viewer deeper into the world of middle earth 
astonishing wonderful fantastic moving involving i could go on and on but i wont all i will say is that if you are one of the millions of us who found peter jacksons quot lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring quot to be one of the most amazing movie experiences ever although i dont know for sure if it can beat out being years old in the movie theatre and seeing star wars for the first time its a different experience not better this version is even better than the one that kept me glued to my seat in the theatre praying it would never end i dont know how many girls have reviewed this but i have to say even if you arent a girl who likes this type of fantasy adventure the men in this film are well worth paying the money for every extra minute with orly bloom the as kicking legolas is heaven i ahevnt even gotten through all of the extra stuff yet but i doubt it will be anything less than pure quality magic peter jackson is a genius dont miss this it makes the quot perfect film quot even better 
i must recommend this new edition the missing scenes fill in a lot of gaps make the movie richer and are inserted expertly if youre a tolkien reader you should definitely get the new edition unlike other extended editions the additional footage didnt slow down the movie not a one should have been left out if not for time constraints new scenes were added at the beginning of the movie to set up the tale of the ring and the setting of the shire and the gifting scene in lothlorien is returned there are many other new moments many very short but all will be appreciated one must wonder if the theatrical release of the two towers will take into consideration this new material or will it have to rely on only the material from the theatrical release for example their cloaks broaches and sams rope were all left out of the theatrical release interpersonal relationships between gimli and legolas can be fudged but those items couldnt be and the rope ends up being so important later on this boxed collection is well worth it it includes cds of additional material and a national geographic special the set comes with a roadmap very necessary there are also different commentator versions 
this is the beginning of the trillogy of lord of the rings it introduces the main characters gandalf the grey aragorn strider lord elrond frodo sam merry pippin sarumon gimli legolas arwen borimer and bilbo it introduces the places like shire rivendell lothlorien bree gondor and mountains as well as creatures of middle earth hobbits humans elves dwarfs wizards orcs trolls and ringwraiths in the fellowship the ring goes from bilbo to frodo baggins and frodo agrees to gandalf the greys request to take the one ring to rivendell to protect the shire from the dark lord he leaves with his friend and gardner samwise gamgie along with two other hobbits merry brandybuck and pippin took the four hobbits make their way from the shower to bree after being followed and nearly attacked by ring wraiths none of the four hobbits have ever left the shire before this adventure and find bree to be somewhat of a scary place filled with big folk or human men while in bree they meet strider who later is revieled as aragorn king of men much to the dislike of the hobbits he takes them to rivendell they stop for a night at weathertop an anchinet watch place of men while at weathertop they get attacked again by the wraiths frodo gets stabbed in the chest by the witch king of the wriaths and aragorn merry pippin and sam must hurry to get him to rivendell to lord elrond a wonderful healer amongs the elves and ruler of rivendell they meet arwen daughter of elrond she offers to takes the wounded frodo to rivendell and gives a thrilling chace with the ring wraiths she makes it to the river that borders rivendell just before the wound nearly kills frodo frodo next wakens in rivendell well and ready to go home a council of elrond is summond together with someone from each race present they discuss what it is to become of this one ring that rules all races in middle earth and come to one decision the ring must be destroyed to save middle earth now the task is out and someone has to agree to take the ring to the fires of morder and throw it in to let it be destroyed after all argues frodo realizes that he is the one who must do this he does not leave rivendell alone he has more companions legolas a prince elf from mirkwood aragorn future king of men gimli son of gloin a dwarf from the mountains gandalf the grey wizard borimer song of the stuard of gondor merry pippin and sam along with frodo these are the companions that set off to destroy the one ring they go through the misty mountains and have several attacks with orcs and trolls and meet an achient demond a belroc a creature that is half smoke and shadow and half flame gandalf challenges the belroc and is assumed to fall to his death the fellowship must still continue on their journey they come to another elven community called the lothlorien and meet white lady lady galadriel they stay the night in lothlorien and continue the next morning they cross the river and continue on boat they are attacked by a new bread of enimies called the fighting urik hai bread for one purpose by the white wizard sarumon bormire is killed by several arrows but before he dies he finally acknoledges aragorn as the king of men while legolas gimli aragorn merry and pippin continue fighting the urik hai frod and sam head off to the mountains of mordor alone merry and pippin are taken by the urak hia as hostages to suraman they think the two hobbits carry the ring aragorn legolas and gimli take a vow to leave frodo and sam to themselves and save pippin and merry and this where the fellowship ends until the two towers i love this movie and the soundtracks i also love pictures of this movie it stars sean astin as sam sean bean as boromir cate blanchett as galadriel orlando bloom as legolas billy boyd as pippin ian holm as bilbo christopher lee as saruman ian mckellean as gandalf the grey dominic monaghan as merry viggo mortensen as aragorn john rhys davies as gimli liv tyler as arwen hugo weaving as lord elrond elijah wood as frodo and marton csokas as lord celeborn husband of lady galadriel i give the fellowship an a and recommend it to everyone who love action war movies with drama and lots of special effects
the first installment of the lord of the rings cinema trilogy the novel was not in fact a trilogy it was one novel published in three parts is a visual triumph honestly i had my doubts about director peter jackson and his ability to bring my favorite novel to life jackson did much to dispell my worries the special effects were very well done i felt a chill run down my spine when the ring wraiths attacked the hobbits on weathertop i found myself impressed with the depth and detail of moria and shuddered with the fear inspired by the forces of darkness in the few shots of mordor the cinematograhpy was simply fabulous hobbiton was exactly as i pictured it and this would hold true for every location in middle earth whether we were looking at the misty mountains or the elven haven of rivendell i was quite impressed with the detail and the amount of work which had obviously gone into making this film as for the plot and the story itself this is where it gets tricky having been a tolkien fan for years i was bound to be disappointed missing characters bilbos relatives the sackville bagginses and tom bombadil to name a few cut out scenes the journey through the old forrest and re arranged scenes the scene at the prancing pony was edited heavily and to the detriment of the story the editing of the sequences between the time of bilbos party and the discovery of the ring for what it is leads one who hasnt read the book to think very little time has gone by however those of us who have read the novel realize this is far from the truth in fact almost years go by having said this i must rate this film stars honestly jackson did a fantastic job overall my quibbles with the film are minor and overcome by the films strong points furthermore unless jackson opted for a film which was at least hour longer than the hour epic we have now there is no way to get this film right purchase this dvd and enjoy the genius of j r r tolkien as interpreted by the genius of peter jackson 
the film the lord of the rings takes the viewer on a trip through time and to another world the backdrops and locations are stunning and breath taking and the actors were superbly cast director peter jackson knew that he was taking a beloved story to the big screen and that there were only possible outcomes fans of the tolkien trilogy would either cringe in horror and ridicule him for destroying defiling and making a mockery of the story or he would be hailed as a movie making genius jackson strove for the latter and succeeded the movie is long minutes long to be exact but youd never know it you get so absorbed into the story the length is just right if it were any shorter the viewer would feel cheated the characters are rich wizards halflings giant ogres elves you name it but the characters are not there just for visual entertainment they are there as integral parts of the story a struggle of good against evil is the epitome of the story the good are few not perfect but good and tender hearted those that are evil are truly that evil the storys hero frodo played perfectly by elijah wood is an innocent bystander who happens to be in the right place at the wrong time but he bravely and happily volunteers to destroy the ring the ring of power that will enable evil forces to conquer the world of middle earth along his journey frodo meets friends and enemies and all struggle against the rings alluring power the dvd does honor to the film by presenting it in discs jam packed with features such as a minute behind the scenes feature of the twin towers the nd part of the trilogy to be released in just months cast interviews multiple featurettes covering integral storylines in depth documentaries and more take a lesson hollywood this is how you package a dvd i highly recommend this film and having it on dvd is a life long investment for your entertainment collection 
with extra scenes got to love lotr you cant go wrong with this movie the extra money paid for the extra scenes is more than worth the price 
i was one of a few who missed the lord of the rings fellowship of the rings at the theatres as i didnt know if id be interested although i knew about the books i was never interested in reading them also i actually didnt see the film until it was released on dvd the non extended version i borrowed it from a friend i sat through it and boy was i ever shocked when the movie ended i felt almost embarrassed because i actually got up in my living room by myself and clapped i could not believe that i missed this at the theatres where the impact would have been much greater i raved to everyone about how great this movie was of course they already had seen it so i felt behind the times i could not wait until the release of the extended version on dvd which i now own i learned my lesson and will listen to my friends on movies like this bottom line just watch this and enjoy yourself cheers to everyone involved with the making of this movie 
for me lotr was a foggy and distant th grade memory i had a general recollection of the book and having enjoyed it but was dim on specifics a good friend of mine alfredo who loved this book so much he was nicknamed alfrodo in school got tickets to see it opening day so i went though i couldnt imagine tranfering this tale to film successfully wow what a great job peter jackson cast and crew did the movie is incredibly enjoyable and brought a feeling of truth to the existence of the middle kingdom you feel the fellowship between the different groups of inhabitants as well as the evil and goodness within the individual characters the special effects are very good for the most part and convincing enough to give me a vertigo on several occassions ian mckellen is very good as gandalf ian holm spot on as bilbo baggins and elijah wood portrays frodo with an absolute sincerity that is charming the warriors are also incredibly well cast they are all very different very complex very believable and with the exception of the dwarf warrior john rhys davies sorry john your a hottie but not in that make up very attractive i was also very impressed with how cleverly they shot the scenes to so those portraying the hobbits seemed so short in relation to everyone and everything else the sets are also excellent its always sign of a good movie when you dont want it to end which i didnt also we didnt realize the movie was three hours long until afterwards when i checked my watch to see what train i could catch to get home i highly recommend this film i cant imagine anyone not enjoying it immensely im now rereading the lord of the rings the film really captures the book and look forward to the second installment of the film trilogy coming out later this year 
the added scenes on the extended edition make the movie a bit longer but increase its enjoyment for purists the extended scenes with galadriel especially close a hole in the plot as to where a character picks up a special sword he uses to great effect in the later return of the king in the book he picked up the sword in a tomb belonging to one of aragorns ancestors people but that was cut out of the film i particularly liked the directors and writers commentary on the dvd they shared their thoughts about how they pictured the developement of the film i shall have to rewatch with some of the actors commentary next time the extras are nice but are basically the ones shown on tv before the film was released overall a terrific representation on film of the first book in the trilogy
 that the movie doesnt the vocabulary of praise has been exhausted and i see no need to wax platitudinous it is simply impossible to capture the feeling this amazing hour movie generates in the heart and the soul im not even going to try one cannot imagine but that the late professor tolkein and his late son and archivist christopher would have cheered this work of not one but many lifetimes tolkein produced a richly textured mythopoeic millieu that should be real that is in fact more detailed than the history of many nations national mythologies who does not long for a world where evil can be driven from the earth jackson et al so nailed the entire book and its as one movie as it is one book that he achieved a miracle our dim praise can add nothing to other than competitive effusiveness the wonder speaks for itself we all have that sinking feeling in our guts that the self proclaimed academy is going to quot annie hall quot lotr as it did to quot star wars quot all those years ago at least we can thank the stars woody allen doesnt have a movie in contention back to the sinking feeling we all know the quot academy quot is going to administer the proverbial boot to messers mesdames jackson walsh mortensen astin woods rhys davies ian mckellen et al the failure to nominate astin as best supporting actor was obscene enough i dearly dearly hope im wrong if a marginal ephemeral movie like quot titanic quot can sweep then the greatest movie of the generation by any measure of justice can and must do the same should things go the way they look to long after this years oscar lights have faded away and even amazing films like quot lost in translation quot and quot master and commander quot are forgotten in the bargain bins at wal mart long after our children have left this earth to our grandchildren one ineluctable truth will remain these movies have few equals and no superiors rather like prof tolkein himself bravissimo furthermore the quot extended quot scenes as a twenty plus year devotee to the man and book which made my wretched early adolescence bearable really complete the story magnificently in quot fellowship quot im amazed that non readers of the books can follow them with having the background of the books the references come so thick and fast but boyens walsh and jackson managed it beautifully my lovely wife whose never read the books tho shes started found it easy to follow the story of course she had the advantage of my near encyclopedic knowledge of tolkeiana i know that was ugly but neologisms are rarely pretty yet more evidence of this quot teams quot multifarious genius and creation of a standard that we children of the seventies see equal the godfather and star wars movies it raises the bar to the invisible and wont be topped for a very very long time if the quot matrix quot asks important questions quot lotr quot answers them 
what can you say about this amazing dvd first of all it validates the format you cant put together this kind of package on vhs especially when you consider all the special audio tracks the film itself is fantastic the extended version is superior to the theatrical release and the documentaries are overwhleming theres so much to watch and learn it takes days to absorb it all special effects that appear on screen for seconds are given minutes of explanation like the big rigs they even spend half an hour on just the sound of the movie its worthwhile to remember how risky the lord of the rings project was after filming all three movies at once more or less the first film had to be a blockbuster or the whole project wouldve been turned into a salvage operation the dvds would have been quick and dirty attempts to recoup lost millions but thanks to the success of the first film the filmmakers could justify this lavish disc set my favorite moments the extended council of elrond the early design drawings the canoe stories the construction of the shire and the biographical documentnary about jrr tolkien the only things i didnt like the color grading is over done in lothlorien why is the forest so blue when the elves and the fellowship stand on a ridge looking at lothlorien in the distance they are looking at a painting and i never understood the difference between orcs and uruk hai do they ever fight orcs or are they always fighting uruks but these minor problems dont hold the dvd back from a five star rating if this extended cut of the fellowship of the ring doesnt rate five stars nothing does 
tolkiens the lord of the rings is brought to life in this stunning detailed vivid well acted and directed film by director peter jackson and his fantastic ensemble cast we see here the beauty of the shire which tolkien imagined as an english countryside here under a bright sun the shire shines in yellow and green and brown the hobbits a folk who average in height and who live in homes constructed into the earth called holes by tolkien himself are attired in colorful peasant attire reflecting their simple country bumpkin lifestyle they garden gossip eat seven meals a day and drink ale whenever possible in the midst of bilbo baggins th birthday party bilbo himself vanishes and prepares to leave his home forever gandalf a wizard and longtime friend of bilbo advises him to leave his magical ring behind bilbo agrees although very reluctantly gandalf passes the ring to frodo bilbos young cousin who is referred to in the film as his nephew gandalf then learns that the very ring bilbo owned was the ring of sauron the one ring and that through this ring sauron an evil being believed to be long dead still lives through the existence of the ring frodo sets off with his gardener and stalwart companion samwise gamgee to find a place to take the ring where it will be kept from evils sight after a council involving elves hobbits men wizards and dwarves it is agreed that the ring will be taken to mount doom where it was forged and will there be destroyed through the course of fellowship we are treated to beautiful scenery stunning effects and solid acting especially for this type of film ian mckellen as gandalf the grey is the heart and soul of the film with elijah wood giving an admirably low key performance as frodo and viggo mortensen is great as the mysterious but virtous strider sean bean a veteran character actor shines as boromir conveying a great depth of emotion sean astin is well cast as sam but his shining moments come in the following films howard shores score is marvelous i recommend the extended dvd for the added scenes which flesh out the plot in great ways and the extras discs which are overfilled with documentaries of all sorts final grade a perfect score 
this is truely worth getting even if you already have the movie there is absolutely nothing negative i can say about this dvd set except for the mere fact it doesnt play on my xbox dvd playerback kit these are enhanced dvd and are not supported by the xbox the audio and visuals are amazing the extra scenes are integrated into the movie so you have to pay attention some are long mins some are short sec these extended scenes really fill in the gap that the original film left out from the book there are hours of extras ranging from the cast to the producers and directors and how the shire was made etc the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring platinum series special extended edition is truely a masterpiece i cant wait for the two towers collectors edition although two towers is coming out in august i am willing to wait another months for all the extras 
this may well get lost amid a flood of reviews but i feel compelled to post it the dvd industry has become notorious for its constant moneygrab quot editions quot with rerelease upon rerelease quot collectors edition quot this and quot platinum version quot that and for the most part that notoriety is well deserved it is shameful transparent and valueless in the majority of cases but not in this one beyond expectations this extended edition finally finally provides a version of the movie that is worthy of the legendary kudos that have been heaped on it allowing jackson to provide it is the best thing new line could have chosen to do financially for them creatively for jackson and his team and entertainment wise for us its a rare win win win i have to say i was not one to agree with the raving over the original theatrical release i may be called a quot purist quot though i certainly would not have characterized myself as such but i unapologetically take offense at the thought of taking creative liberties with a license and set of literature of the level of unmatched brilliance scope and endurance as tolkiens as such things like arwen replacing glorfindel the editing mockery imposed on the elrond council the reduction of the hobbits to comic relief and so on compounded each other and drastically reduced the movies value for me i thought the film was ok but for this passionate fan of the books it was ultimately more disappointment than pleasant surprise however beyond belief i have to say that this extended edition redeems the film in ways i could never have imagined extra minutes doing the better pacing during travel sequences the darker menace of the battles the enhanced majesty and relevance of the lothlorien sequence the extra character development e g boromir frodo gimli a much more powerful intelligent finale its hard to fathom that individual example improvements like these could make such an incredible difference but they can and do to the point where this is practically a new film altogether the added scenes were masterfully selected and the new scores for them are marvelous not only has peter jackson used the lack of time constraints to excellent advantage but he has actually gotten better at his editing choices as well to the point where i feel this film really does reflect tolkiens original vision better than the original theatrical release in short this is the version of this movie that deserves all the raving it seems that the worlds embrace of the first film has hopefully given jackson and his team the liberty and confidence to more fully realize tolkiens vision and i now feel more encouraged than before by the potential of the next two films and perhaps even moreso by their own extended editions if they are planned there are still some things that will never be quot fixed quot per se arwen being one example but otherwise this is a true marvel of a re release and is more than worth the money the extras and they are excellent in their own right just make it even more of a no brainer an absolutely spectacular offering 
this took a great fantasy film and made it a masterpiece that will truly be ageless and timeless probably the best addition to the film is the new intro wich starts much like the book a simple introduction to the hobbits the best part is that this version is not so rushed the story takes time to question talk and truly care about its characters you learn more about certain motivations and you get to sit back and enjoy the movie on a whole nother level beyond the talk action run sort of thing the theatrical release seemed to be stuck in over all its much more enjoyable and truly a cinematic masterpiece i love being able to absorb the richness of the shire for minutes before leaving it for the long arduous journey to destroy the ring almost all the locations are extended allowing the viewer to enjoy the richness of tolkiens world and how peter brings it to life so vividly if for some reason you dont like widescreen you really should do your research every dvd has an option anamorphic widescreen that will stretch out the picture without losing the sides full screen does alot of things with the picture to fit it unaturally into the tv square size you really miss alot when its full screen the black bars on your screen are only their because tv was never made to show cinematic films thanks to widescreen tvs that will no longer be a problem but please before you bash it find out what your missing and how dvd using anamorphic widescreen has given every movie the ability to fill up the whole screen even square tvs but importanly without losing picture i hope that the two towers is as enhanced with the extra footage in the expanded edition as this one was its a shame that the best versions of each film will rarely if ever see the light of a true theatre experience 
i have been waiting anxiously for this movie to come out in theatres ever since i first starting hearing the buzz about the movie being made then there were the trailers i saw the first couple of trailers and thought okay it looks good but dont get your hopes up its going to be disappointing and it may even stink much like say episode sigh so when the movie was finally released i went to see it with fairly low expectations i was completely blown away i felt like i was twelve years old again and watching star wars for the very first time this movie is fantastic i loved the story i loved the visuals the characters were perfect for the story okay so maybe arwen was a little more zesty than she was in the book get over it i have now seen it three times and will more than likely see it again a couple more times before it leaves the theatres i dragged my mom to see it when she came to town for the holidays my husband and i dragged my father in law and brother in law to see it when we went to see them after christmas i love this movie it has easily earned a place in my top five favorite movies of all time and i think its the best movie i have seen in at least five years i cannot wait until next december when the next movie is released thank you peter jackson for bringing the magic back to movies 
i never read the tolkien before seeing this movie there i said it i have since then and it raises the question with movies like this and harry potter about reliability to the text is it a virtue or a nusiance to try and recreate a book word for word on the big screen i personally think its maddening it cannot be done properly so its hardly even worth attempting my advice is do as much as you can start with the words always start with the words and let your own vision and ideas take flight peter jackson who id never heard of prior to this did a superb job of taking a classic tale and giving it new life on the screen the frodo we see on the screen is not the frodo we read about in the books but hes the right frodo for the movie the visual style was stunning the performances were largely oscar calibre i can even live with the sappy end credits theme to say that the music was flawless im obviously not going to go into a whole in depth review because chances are youve read too many of them already so lets shorthand it in fifty years this movie will be remembered known and studied as one of the greatest movies of all time the disc is a must buy for tolkien fans jackson fans fantasy fans or even just plain old movie fans and how hard does gandalf rock 
if you want to really see how good these theatrical edition blu rays are play the te dvds first then put in the blu ray version no comparison the blu ray blows the dvds away i own all versions on dvd and now blu ray i was holding off on purchasing until the ee versions but when amazon offered them at each i gave in i had already seen them via netflix so i knew what i was getting the nice surprise is the special features dvd that is included on all bds there were reports of the super stores throwing in a digital copy instead of the extras dvd my favorite features on the extras dvd are the enya may it be video and the making of lotr behind the scenes i highly recommend these blu rays to anyone on the fence i too have read all the reviews and somewhat agree however these are still head and shoulders above the dvd when played side by side this is the best version to date amazon shipped in one week as well another reason why i always shop amazon first everytime samsung p lcd with panasonic bd player 
before i sing my praises let me first admit with slight embarrassment that i havent read a single page of the tolkien books on which lord of the rings is based but that didnt prevent me from appreciating this movie quite simply i was literally blown away quite possibly the greatest epic adventure since lawrence of arabia lord of the rings thrills captivates enthralls and entertains you from start to finish its the great fantasy adventure that harry potter should have been and can never be i saw the extended hour version late friday night and i watched every frame of the movie until in the morning because i couldnt take my eyes off the screen you can tell that director peter jackson invested a lot of love into this project through the scenery the performances the breathtaking action sequences and the pacing elijah wood is badly underrated as frodo who along with his cohorts begins an adventure in which he protects a ring with magic powers against various forces of evil viggo mortensen and sir ian mckellen also shine tremendously especially mckellen who was robbed of a supporting actor oscar unfortunately women dont have much of a presence in this movie though cate blanchett and liv tyler make the best of their underwritten roles when lord of the rings first came out in dvd in august i deliberately avoided the disc version for i knew that a deluxe edition was forthcoming and while the pricetag is somewhat steep it is worth every dime i never saw the original theatrical release but the hour version passes along nicely and never drags if there is one dvd you must buy this year this one is certainly it its bound to be remembered as a beloved classic and having finally seen it i now eagerly await the next two lotr films 
the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring produced anddirected by peter jackson score by howard shore based on the book byj r r tolkien screenplay by peter jackson fran walsh and philippaboyens starring elijah wood sean astin ian mckellen viggo mortensen andyserkis orlando bloom john rhys davies sean bean liv tyler hugoweaving cate blanchett billy boyd ian holm leo mckern andchristopher lee one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bringthem all and in the darkness bind them it is the end of the third age and the dark lord sauron havingrestored his strength is moving once more to seize absolute dominionof middle earth all he needs to be utterly invincible is to recoverhis great ring of power lost to him a thousands years ago unknown tothe dark lord the ring has been in the unrealized possession of anheretofore insignificant and short of stature race known as hobbits when the wizard gandalf realizes the truth a desperate plan isconceived someone will journey into the dread land of mordor thestronghold of sauron and plunge the ring into the fires where it wasforged thus destroying it and through it the dark lord thus a fellowship made up of the wizard gandalf men elves dwarvesand four hobbits is formed to take the ring on the great quest butthere is tremendous dangers to be overcome the ring is both atemptation and a burden to those who carry it and the eye of sauronsearches the land for his ring the world hangs in the balance this will be a difficult film to write anything about since it is wellnigh perfect and the definitive version of the trilogy while jacksonon his own is no great shakes as a director and terribly politicallycorrect and condescending as witness his awful king kong remake he waswise enough to realize that the lord of the rings of the film wastolkien just do it and do it like the printed source with respect andaherence and you can coast to critical acclaim and an oscar or two and so it came to pass some minor thoughts in spite of being broken up into three filmsthis is really one long film rather like a miniseries so when onesays that this is a masterpiece it should be understood that thiscovers all three films the versions to watch are the extendedversions available on dvd as they are vast improvements over thetheatrical cuts which were shaved for time considerations howardshores score truly grows on one with repeated viewings christopherlee fans should enjoy this as it makes a fitting final bow for theactor the evil saruman is a great role for lee and the characterdominates the first two films in a way lees count dooku does not inthe star wars films the dark riders are perfectly realized weaving bean and blanchett have their best moments in this section of theseries and are quite memorable as is the balrog recommended 
 quot the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring quot is every bit a grand epic from the movies spectacular opening battle to the mines of moria and the mystical eaves of lothlorien fellowship is a visual stunner and a blockbuster of the pedigree of quot star wars quot moreover fellowship whets the appetite for the next two movies in the trilogy of course the story was spun decades before from the mind of author j r r tolkien but taking tolkiens words and translating their magic to the big screen is a formidable task and director peter jackson does a job worthy of rivendells praise his vision of middle earth is darker than mine but not by much most importantly jackson captures that feeling of impending doom that so pervaded the books and gave the story its juice hobbit frodo baggins played by the magnetic elijah wood is bestowed with the impossible task of saving middle earth he must trek to the evil land of mordor and cast the omnipotent one ring into the fires of mount doom the movie is chock full of dazzling action sequences and visual effects but the movie never strays too far from the roots of tolkiens tale ian mckellen sparkles in his role as gandalf the wizard while other cast members deliver their lines with an earnestness missing from most budget busting movies these days as a fan of tolkien the movie shattered my expectations as a movie goer fellowship i can assure you is well worth the price of admission 
 rings were created by the dark lord sauron three given to the elves seven to the dwarves and nine to the race of men there was a th ring created by sauron in which he infused his power this ring was the master ring of the others the ring was lost and eventually ended up with the hobbit bilbo baggins bilbo gives the ring to his nephew frodo played to perfection by former child star elijah wood gandalf finds out that the ring in the possession of frodo is indeed the evil ring he tells frodo that it must be destroyed because its evil has immense power over mortal men frodo ends up wat the kingdom of the elves where he sets out on a quest with a band of humans elves dwarves and hobbits their quest to take it to the place of the rings creation the mountain of doom and destroy it by throwing it into the fire from which it came an evil wizard the former mentor of gandalf is creating an army to retrieve the ring and revive sauron this movie is a fantasy of epic proportions its is a fine adaptation of the tolkein classic the special effects are very good and the oscar winning cinemetography is fantastic as well as the oscar winning score that perfectly sets the mood for the movie the expanded version has extra minutes to the original theatrical release i didnot see the original so i really cannot compare the two but the longer movie gives a lot of depth to the story there were many creappy characters and violent scenes that may be disturbing to small children i had a friends who took their two small boys to see this movie and they said it was border line they told me that the two towers is even more violent and darker the two towers continues frodos quest to destroy the ring 
lotrs is by far one of the best works of art to ever be penned onto paper and just as jrrt saw his vision unfold as he wrote peter jackson has expanded on that vision into something spectacular this film has everything you would expect it was filmed with the same passion in which it was written i cannot wait until the special edition dvd comes out with extra minutes of film this was one film no matter how long you just dont want to end thankfully jackson filmed all three films in this trilogy together and will be bringing one film to theaters for the next two years and wont make us wait the span of almost years like g lucas has with star wars do yourself and see this movie you will not be disappointed 
thus far i have seen lotr fotr in the theater three times the first time i saw this movie i was somewhat disappointed because i kept comparing it to the book and the animated version that came out in but when i saw it a second time i found myself appreciating the film on its own merits i still do have a couple of minor quibbles i believe they should have shown a couple of quick scenes with gollum following frodo and his comrades as they rowed down the anduin river this is important for viewers who never read the books because it would have served to remind them that gollum is still pursuing them instead we get a brief glimpse of him in the mines of moria and then nothing more afterwards but perhaps such a scene will be included in the expanded dvd version that comes out later this year my only other gripe is that the scenes leading up to boromirs attempt to seize the ring should have been truer to the book with frodos companions conflicted over whether to go to minas tirith or onward to mordor that tension was missing from the movie but apart from these minor issues this movie was just about everything i could have hoped for some purists object to the exclusion of the tom bombadil character from the movie but as much a fan of the books that i am i never really understood what purpose his character served and that at best the episode in the old forest was mere filler to provide the hobbits with some adventures i can hardly wait for the second installment to be released as well as the expanded edition of fotr on disc this coming winter 
forget everything you saw in the theater the extended version dvd features minutes of additional footage that truly enhances peter jacksons vision for the trilogy some additional footage is only seconds long while other parts include full scenes among them youll find an introduction and additional footage of the shire merry and pip singing in a bar a longer fellowship council scene with further insights into boromirs attraction to the ring some additional footage that helps to explain aragorn and arwens relationship samwise reciting some poetry after gandalfs death and some wonderful footage with galadriel at lothlorien as she gives each member of the fellowship a gift to take with them the only drawback and it is a minor one is that this version also includes additional scenes of violence in particular one scene where the uruk hai attacking boromir pulls a knife from his leg and licks it was inappropriate the extended version is far truer to the original story in that it adds additional moments of levity and grace that seemed missing from the original theatrical version the stories are filled with examples of the hobbits singing and reciting poems as they journey and the extended version attempts to put some of that back into the film this helps to make the film not quite so dark fans of the film will not be disappointed with this dvd set 
one of the best fantasy adventure movies ever j r r tolkeins world comes alive in the most beautiful breathtaking way a must see 
the reason i give this movie five stars is because i was entertained by it since i have never read any of the books i didnt know what to expect and i was nicely surprised this movie includes adventure excitement breath taking speacle affects and cool fight scenes not to mention i think the acters did really well and the music is awsome i havent seen any thing quite like it watch this movie you wont regret it 
the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring is one of my favorite movies clocking in at just under three hours fellowship never stops rolling whether it be in the green pastures of the shire the beautiful city of rivendell or the dark evil mines of moria based on tolkiens novel this film by peter jackson should not be missed the movie tells the story of the one ring the ring that could destroy mankind it centers around frodo baggins the nephew of bilbo baggins made famous by the hobbit upon hearing from gandalf the grey what the ring really is frodo sets off on an adventure to destroy the one ring in the fiery pits of mount doom frodo battles the ringwraiths countless orcs and even himself as the ring tries to take him over the nine ringwraiths are truly great villains without even saying a word even at three hours the film is a nonstop ride through the middle earth great roles for elijah wood ian mckellen viggo mortensen sean astin kate blanchett liv tyler orlando bloom and sean bean as boromir a man greatly tempted by the powers of the one ring excellent musical score incredible scenery and likable characters the dvd is unbelievable with too many extras to even count read tolkiens novel for more backround information on the characters as well as the plot lines a modern classic that shouldnt be missed 
whether youve seen the theatrical version of fotr or not the extended version is a must not only the additional scenes but the extended scenes make this version much richer than the already incredible theatrical release a few days after watching the extended edition i caught the end of the movie on tv as it was playing boromirs death scene just as he dies aragorn stands tears running down his face as i waited to hear quot they will look for his coming at the white tower but he will not return quot it cut to the next scene it was almost painful to watch i know that in the book the line isnt spoken for another chapter or two but it made the scene far more powerful and emotional what is too bad is that new line didnt feel that lotr fans would tolerate another or minutes in the theatre i would love to see all three movies in their extended versions on the big screen regardless buy this movie and the two towers in the extended versions and lets hope its not too long before we see return of the king in the same format by the way be sure to watch as many of the special features as possible especially the cast commentary its a riot 
before you see the movie you should read the books all of them quite a commitment then sit down and watch tolkiens world come to life in a brilliant way it would have been very easy to ruin this unbelievable story in movie form but the director instead actually brings the entire book to life its the story of frodo baggins a hobbit living in the peaceful shire in middle earth he shares this world with elves wizards goblins and all other sort of characters he also shares it with sauron a being i can only describe as the devil unknown to frodo he inherits a magical ring that makes you invisable this ring once belonged to sauron and if he gets it back its all over the world will be plunged into darkness and evil forever so frodo and company set out to destroy the ring the problem is it can only be destroyed on saurons back door which is a long long long journey away filled with perils frodo sets out with many hardships to fullfil his quest all the time having his mind poisoned by the evil of the ring watching or reading tolkien almost makes you believe this world did exist in a history long forgotten and unrecorded 
fanboys and girls of the anal retentive sort need not apply really im serious here dont go if youre going to whine about how this word got changed or that character is no longer in the story because youll drive yourself and everyone around you mad within about ten minutes i also say this because i want to make a point about the difference between a novel and a film a difference that a lot of people never seem to grasp while some folks might want to see a twelve or fifteen hour mini series in which we watch every step out of the shire every meal and listen to every talking head at the council of elrond the audience even among true fans would be very limited what reads well does not always film well and vice versa decisions were made and for the most part i think they were made well cutting tom bombadil was very sensible imo since theres almost no way to film him without turning him at best into one of those quaint goofy characters you find in so many monster movies of the thirties and early forties at worst well there wouldnt be a dry seat in the house replacing glorfindel with arwen on the flight to rivendell was an excellent choice because it lets us see an arwen who is not only her fathers daughter but a worthy mate for aragorn and glorfindel never appears again so whats really lost these choices make good dramatic sense and for better or worse a filmmaker has to think along dramatic lines not literary ones its true that i wish more time could have been given to some things but i also believe that its possible that many of these issues will be used to good dramatic advantage in the second and third films as to the film that is as opposed to the one that might have been i have a tremendous amount of admiration for peter jackson and his crew for having pulled off what i thought would be an almost impossible task theyve made a film which while it remains true to the spirit of the book is very accessible the hard work shows here in every scene though never intrusively the sets just look right they have an air of reality of age and even decay the casting is spot on in most cases and the casting of elijah wood as frodo was masterful ive never been a fan of his but i have nothing but admiration for the way hes played a very difficult role so far the camera work can be a bit intense i admit rushing from sharp close up to vast vista and back it can be dizzying especially if youre sitting towards the front of the theater and some of the extreme close ups the ones which let you count the pores in peoples noses are overwhelming but the lighting of the film is superb with each choice having a meaning and setting the mood perfectly one of the biggest stumbling blocks to any fantasy that includes non human creatures is how those creatures come across i found the choices pretty consistently good the orcs are almost a textbook illustration of the word quot abomination quot so when sauruman recounts the story of how they were orginally created from captive elves you see the resemblance and it becomes all that much more awful the balrog which could have been merely laughable was genuinely fearsome here comes something the orcs are afraid of we are in deep trouble frankly it would take a much longer review to do justice to this film the best i can say to you is this if youre not a rigid purist then go enjoy it dont feel even remotely guilty for liking whats up there on the screen its a good film and thats the best we could have hoped for if youre new to the story you may find yourself a bit lost from time to time but it shouldnt be a bar to enjoying the film and perhaps youll decide to read the book afterwards either way think of the film and the book as complimentary entities the one informing the other you can enjoy either or both if you can set aside expectations and concentrate on what is there on the screen for us highly recommended 
those film makers responsible for fellowship of the ring have cast down the gauntlet of integrity to all their peers in the cinematic world and its about time forget george lucas and his embarrassing indifference to a mass audience that does crave a powerful story as much as it craves grandeur in special effects fellowship is a transcendent film because it is infused with soul and spirit and it utilizes the best tools that technical creativity in modern film can provide but here the effects serve the story and its human performances not vice versa fellowship grips the heart the mind the eyes and the being it is a universal tale of the highest moral and visual order it is the tale of diverse peoples gathering not to wage war upon each other but upon evil itself every performance is stellar and each role is cast to perfection i challenge anyone not to be moved by the first laughing glimpse of chemistry and camaraderie between elijah woods frodo and ian mckellans gandalf as the old wizard wheels his rickety way into the shire i challenge anyone not to be terrified in the pit of their soul at the mere thought of the simple unimaginably evil ring and likewise by the nazgul black riders as they close in on their prey like devils in a dream i challenge anyone not to hold their breath during the battle between saruman and gandalf and involuntarily exhale that same breath to marvel at its spiraling result i challenge anyone not to feel their own spirits rise as the fellowship makes its stand against the orcs and their troll in the chamber at moria i challenge anyone not to feel the triumph of gandalfs quaking power against the balrog turn in the next instant to utter heartbreak i challenge anyone with a soul not to be affected by the doubt and fear and final perseverance of the unlikely frodo and sam this is a film my friends this is a tale to remember and to cherish as long as we are human let us do ourselves a favor and together make it one of the sacred treasures of our increasingly diverse global quot culture quot 
in george lucas changed the entertainment industry forever when star wars became the biggest movie of all time that film not only altered the way films are made but it also changed how films are marketed and even altered the very way we watch movies what many people do not know is that star wars was almost never made originally lucas wanted to adapt j r r tolkiens lord of the rings for the big screen he abandoned the project partially because of legal issues before starting star wars nearly years later tolkiens masterpiece has finally been transformed into a motion picture the mastermind behind this colossal undertaking is peter jackson an almost unknown filmmaker best known for a couple of horror movies and the indie flick heavenly creatures jackson is amazing the fellowship of the ring is filmmaking at its finest jackson does everything right that most action directors do wrong granted he had a talented cast to assist him ian mckellen is perfect as gandalf elijah wood has just enough innocence and world weariness to capture the essence of frodo baggins viggo morensen personifies the nobility of the exiled king aragorn and john rhys davies is a treat as gimli the dwarf most of the other performances are just as moving the fellowship of the ring is filled with fantastic places and wonderful creatures but thes do not a good movie make other directors have had films with similar settings and characters and have failed jackson has succeeded because he has remained true to the heart of tolkien the lord of the rings is much more than just a tale of a motley crew traveling together to a destiny unseen it is a tale of friendship it is about life and how to be a better person it is a story of how the most unlikely individuals can become heroes it is a tale of truth defying falsity of redemption and salvation of good triumphing over evil in the troubled times in which we live we need stories like the lord of the rings they remind us of the nobility in all of us movies dont get much better than that 
this is simply a must on your dvd shelf the high quality of picture and audio settings the lots of extras the exceptionally good and loyal transfer from literature to visual thanks to mr jackson the exceptionally good direction by mr jackson the whole movie is never bore and is extremely absorbing finally the extended version is also not a little bit over long it just gives you to enjoy this legend in a much more complete sense
after hearing lucas on the star wars episode ii dvd talking about nothing but blue screen this and blue screen that and then listening to peter jackson and his team say excitedley quot we built our own armor quot the toughest lotr skeptic cant help but appreciate what these guys did to make the film come to life every bit of the five and a half hours of the behind the scenes footage is amazing i honestly thought i would get bored but i found myself coming back for more the extended cut is fabulous especially the re cut of the cave troll sequence the jackson boyens walsh commentary is also very good however if you have not read the two towers and return of the king do not listen to the commentaries the gift set is a great buy and is a must for fans i do not feel a penny was wasted after getting it 
then this is a great movie a wonderful adaptation of the original book with beautiful vision and cinemetography this movie gets the whole trilogy rolling if youre a lover of this then i highly recommend the extended edition over the cinema release where the extra footage is significant and well done in my opinion it was only cut because they couldnt put a movie this long in theaters 
my first glimpse of the lord of the rings trilogy was a trailer in a movie theater i remember thinking what spectacular scenery and cool a bunch of good looking men climbing up a snow covered mountain i told my dad and brother about it because they are big tolkien fans however i was skeptical we own the animated version of the hobbit and i never really cared for it when it came to the theaters i decided that i had to see it i went to the theater and sat in awe i had never seen anything like it especially the orcs viggo mortensen as aragorn and elijah wood as froddo stand out but the movie is a group effort with everyone providing stellar performances the brass band playing the theme during the evil parts is perfect lending a gripping uneasy feeling i fell in love with the story the story of good and evil of friendship and hope is the best part it stands alone buying the trilogy on dvd means you dont have to wait a year to see what happens the extended version completes the story the fellowship of the ring remains my favorite of the three because it lured me into its world it is a cinematic wonder 
like many lovers of tolkiens lord of the rings i felt a feeling of almost ownership of the story although i looked forward to it i almost dreaded it being filmed i fully expected a big budget epic of lord of the rings to be a typical hollywood style rendering of a beloved tale complete with shortcuts changes in storyline etc what a nice surprise to see a fine film instead true to the storyline and to tolkien in spirit the film cuts and changes only what it needs to in order to tell the tale on screne elijah wood does a fine job as frodo baggins ian mcclellan is gandalf on the screen as far as i am concerned while the casting is well done throughout what is especially endearing is the attention to detail throughout the film little things such as shields clothing furniture are all done in such a manner that it seems indigenous to the culture of middle earth its also a great benefit that most of the film was done in one filming and edited into three movies the continuity should be much better than in other sequels if youre a fan of the books youll love this if youve never read a page of tolkien youll love it also great film and i cant wait for the two towers 
i have seen the fellowship of the ring four times in theatres and now twice at home since purchasing the dvd on the first day it was available i could watch it twice a day for the rest of my life and not get tired of it you dont need to have read the book the story explains itself admirably as it goes along if theres something you dont understand just be patient it will get explained eventually yet it isnt overexplained either very little pure exposition i have only two complaints the movie is too short in remastering the soundtrack to issue the dvd they made the music too soft in comparison to the dialogue one of the joys of the movie is the music and there are times on the dvd where you can barely hear it some people have complained that the movie isnt faithful to the book ok yes there are changes in detail and some events have been left out yet the net effect is to tighten up the plot and better justify some later events that otherwise seem to spring out of nowhere in the books i think tolkien himself would have liked it 
the lord of the rings fellowship of the ring is an epic movie in every way i normally dont like fantasy based movies but this one just blew me away i enjoyed every minute of the hours i was hooked from beginning to end its rare that a movie of that length would keep anyone interested for that long but it did it was awesome visually it was excellent but the characters and the storyline is what will keep you hooked the characters are awesome the acting was amazing it was dramatic emotional and action packed the basic plot is about a hobbit played oh so well by elijah wood that acquires a ring of dark power and he has to destroy it a lot unfolds along the way the lord of the rings fellowship of the ring is pure magic and the ending leaves you craving parts and 
what more can be said that hasnt been already this film was already good as it was but the extended version plums more depths than the theatrical version and allows fans a more leisurely trip through middle earth the added material is wonderful and is a must have for fans of the books or just film buffs in general some may complain about the length but you can always stop and come back to it later right the bonus material is wonderful and while some of it may only be of interest to technophiles other material is worth checking out too much to even list and more than one can sift through in one sitting bottom line this is a great dvd collection that blows away all others and dont forget the film itself a masterpiece 
i first read the hobbit and the lord of the rings trilogy when i was about years old since then i have been a devoted disciple of not only j r r tolkien but of literature in general tolkien who was a professor of literature at oxford university incorporated features from such epic poems as beowulf into the hobbit and his ring trilogy creating a link to other literary works which has always fascinated me and led me to explore other literature i must admit that when i first heard that peter jackson would be bringing the ring to the big screen i immediately felt indignant almost angry that someone would tamper with tolkiens masterpiece after all how often has the film industry completely rewritten pieces of literature or altered history to make a movie more palatable i am pleased to say that my misgivings were completely inaccurate mr jackson gave himself to reproducing tolkiens vision of middle earth with an awesome exactness the locales are fantastic cinematography stunning and casting wonderful not to mention a delightful musical score tolkiens classic good versus evil storyline was adhered to almost to the letter this movie will be as great a classic as the books are it is a fantastic achievement for mr jackson and the cast and crew and undoubtedly will be a catalyst to introduce many children to the joys of reading 
i have to admit that when i first saw the movie i thought it was just good after seeing the extended edition i would have to saythis is one of the best movies ive seen the extended version brings some of the characters more to life one of my favorite addition was the dwarfs words to the elf queen very deep considering the animosity between the elves and dwarves this is the ultimate story of good and evil and how good must always keep on guard for the weaknesses they have there are so many things to learn from this movie this is not just an action flick but a life lesson i am currently reading the book and yes the movie takes certain liberties with the story but he never loses whats at the heart of book the movie runs about three and a half hours and this may be a bit long for some but since the movie spans two discs you you can watch it over two nights 
a film adaptation of this book is quick to come to mind because it would easily be a visual spectacle and a cinematic feat however simply trying to conceive where to begin with such an immense tale and with such a large and faithful fan base is unfathomable to say the least regardless peter jackson accomplished the impossible and did it well too in fact it was tolkiens son that said it was impossible but clearly for anyone to say from this point on that a book is unable to be adapted to the big screen new hope lies with the success of this film commercially and artistically usually the decree is that film adaptations stray too far from their source material in this case the filmmakers did everything possible to maintain the feel of the book if not every individual scenario and it works well because of that many have criticized the film adaptation of the first harry potter for too closely following the book in the case of the lord of the rings it follows it suitably diverging where necessary omitting where obligated but maintaining everything about the narrative the characters and the settings that made the books the success that they continue to be to dissect the individual aspects of the production the film appears seamless the performances are well done all around there is a thin line that the actors must all walk bordering between natural and over the top to achieve the necessary degree of fantasy and solemnity the actors succeed and come across perfectly the screenplay is well written and intelligently incorporates all facets of tolkiens universe regardless of its original presence in the main lotr text it is obvious that everyone did their research and it shows in the clever writing and subtle references to other aspects of middleearth to say all this is still to speak nothing of the special effects which come out of nowhere and surpass even the most ambitious efforts from the year in a year when it appeared that industrial light magic had finally been presented with an imagination that exceeded their capabilities read the mummy returns harry potter it comes as a godsend that the no name special effects company weta could surpass the competition and bring a nearly perfect visualization of all the creatures and worlds in lotr the effects are not perfect mind you but intertwined with every aspect as well as the ambitious nature of the project makes you forget any minute shortcomings that might be apparent but perhaps the most prominent star of this film has to be jacksons direction which some might find over the top but which occurred to me as a necessary and exciting aspect to this film one can literally see jacksons enthusiasm as the camera moves around and about but never ostentatiously or in a distracting way it is very appropriate and does so much to incorporate the viewer into the movie it might mean little to suggest but it almost seems that some films find the subject matter too daunting to put the effort into creative filming in the case of lotr some of the shots are so complex and long and intense and from the looks of it impossible that jackson appears to love every minute of it and thereby the audience does too indeed some shots are like a roller coaster implemented correctly as they are it is a truly enthralling excursion into this intense and fascinating world and so the finished product of this massive cast and crew is one of the greatest films of the year and perhaps the greatest fantasy film ever if there is one downside it is that ive got two more years before i can see the conclusion all around great efforts coupled with the ubiquitous passion for the text has helped to craft a perfect film and a spectacle for the big screen moreover this is certainly not one to be missed on the big screen rental or video can never capture the grandeur and the vision that have built the impossible book into a great movie 
i was well aware of the green tint issue when i purchased the set it is the reason i waited so long to buy it it is the reason i was just a little apprehensive the first time i watched it it is the reason i felt like a fool after i finished the first film these movies look amazing yea if you want to see some tint and spend all of your time looking for it it might pop out at you if not you are going to love this set this is my first experience with the extended edition and i could not be more happy that i replaced my regular edition blurays the story is so much more filled out im almost surprised i liked these movies in the theaters ive only just started to get into all of the special features but so far they are great i dont normally bother to comment on the packaging but this is too well done to neglect it truly feels like something epic when you open up the box the only thing that might hold someone back from getting this set is the fear of a super ultra mega set after the hobbit is released but that is years away so just bite the bullet and buy it already 
crisp visuals matched with superior sound the extras will take days to go through match the viewing with an hd tv and you have fine entertainment for once the academys awards were truly justified 
first of all this release on blu ray improves the already clear picture exponentially the extended edition of the movies is the only way to go i wish wb would understand this with the harry potter movies without the extended edition added material there are threads of story that dont make sense one example serves in fellowship of the ring galadriel gives sam an elfen rope in the two towers he puts the rope around gollums neck and gollum says it burns yes it does because of the elfen connection passage after passage gain by the sometimes minor extensions it makes the movies rather long but so what at home we dont worry about that we are to watch and enjoy pausing between dvds if we want the performances are already well known but this is the edition to have the rd and th dvd in each movie set explains the makiing of the movie it is fascinating to watch now and then to gain greater amazement at just how much was accomplished in groundbreaking work andy serkis gollum eventually was captured by motion capture cameras and equipment a technique that came back when he and peter jackson did king kong serkis is also caesar in the new rise of the planet of the apes the fifth dvd per movie is new it wasnt in the older edition it is a sort of high classed home movie of the filming it is fascinating but a few shots are in both that and the other dvds while only the movie is in blu ray technology the other three dvds are still fine quality thank you peter jackson and new line cinema for presenting this in the best way possible at a reasonable price discs at this price are you kidding me 
i dont think i can convey by words how beautiful this film looks in full blu ray on a nice tv dont miss out by focusing only on video dont forget about audio a nice set of speakers or even a soundbar can greatly increase the viewing experience of any film 
although i have previously only reviewed rotk having chosen to not be just another flag waving reviewer on the previous movies i have to make comment on this extended dvd set im not going to dwell too much on the actual movies as they speak for themselves for the most part with the exception herein of a more complete story albeit very very long puritans may scoff at the deviations from tolkeins original work but few can surely argue at the vast spectacle of it all and amazing achievement to bring such a complex story to life on screen the minutes extra footage per movie is well worth the wait and will fill in many blanks even if you have already seen the movie theater or previous release versions this is mostly true in the last movie return of the king which seems so different from the screen release it almost makes you feel it was edited too harshly for me however the prize here is the extensive collection of special features each film has an extra two discs with a complete chronological series of featurettes entitled from page to screen which are fascinating to say the least the extras are easy viewing and give even fans an insight into the life of tolkein and the scale of the work that is the lord of the rings its very easy to hear that a movie costs millions to produce but when you watch the enormous amount of detail work manpower and every other facet of the production of these films over a year period you actually come away almost awe struck a beautiful and timeless tale that will never go out of style and a worthy addition to any collection for many years to come peter jackson et al more than deserve every accolade and superlative that has been bestowed on the trilogy in my opinion and it will be interesting to see his next movie king kong to see whether he will be able to live up to viewers expectations either way this will long be regarded among the greatest movies ever made superb 
this is not the review of the movies i am solely reviewing the facts that what extra you get in this set than the previous editions i will start with very basic facts for those who are baffled by so many editions being out there the basic facts lotr series has basically two types of movies a theatrical and b extended each edition are available in both dvd and blu ray format extended versions of the movies have humongous amount of extra film footage added to the theatrical editions approx and additional minutes for movie and respectively so go for the extended editions only if you are a die hard fan of the movies if you are not the review ends here buy whichever movie you like in your preferred format and enjoy thanks for lotr fans lets get straight to the point now many of you may as well own the dvd versions of lotr either theatrical or extended ot both and if you are trying to make a decision whether to spend more money on this blu ray extended here is the comparison extended dvd set for each movie they have discs movie discs and extra features so total discs sound is dts es which is significantly better than regular dolby digital this set is probably the most gorgeous i have ever seen for any dvd colorful and feature packed it stands out in your entire collection extended blu ray set for each movie they have discs movie blu ray discs extra feature dvds and behind the scene dvd so total discs audio is spine chilling dts hd and it has the all the betterments of blu ray hd pic hd sound bd live also blu ray set includes the digital copy of the extended versions of all three movies standard definition not hd the set itself is a delight with a sturdy golden cardboard package that is durable and beautiful the remastering of these movies have been handled excellently and with respect to both picture and sound this one is significantly better than the dvd the good blu ray set over dvd set video and audio significantly improved excellent blu ray transfer i have not noticed any darker colors as mentioned by some other viewers blu ray set has three extra dvds behind the scene for each movie apart from the extra feature dvds blu ray set has digital copies of extended versions of all three movies they did not waste a dvd for digital copy you download them straight from the server digital copies are great downloads and super easy together its almost gb download which was overwhelming for me the not so good extra feature dvds for each movie are the same as those of dvd editions in fact the dvds are identical when i do head to head comparison these dvds are pulled straight from the older dvd editions nothing new added there the overall appearence of the set is not as beautiful as the dvd sets this one is excellently packed though lacks the colours of the dvd set extra feature discs are dvds and not blu rays final verdict if you own the extended dvd set then buy this only if you want to have a great improvement in pictutre and sound quality the only extra features you get is behind the scenes dvds all other extra feature dvds total of them will be a duplication of what you already own in extended dvd set actually i noticed that all the extra feature dvds here are from the various older dvd editions the two dvds are from the extended dvd set and the one behind the scene is probably pulled from the limited editions of lotr the double sided dvds that new line cinema released sometimes back however if you do not own the dvd versions then this is a must buy as this includes almost everything that you can think of hd movies extra features behind the scenes plus digital copies update also check the images i uploaded which may help make the comparison update thanks for all those who marked this review as helpful as you are interested in lotr i guess at some point youll consider purchasing hobbit as well i have recently written reviews for those hope you find them useful too comments are welcome thanks again 
 i cant do this sam i know its all wrong by rights we shouldnt even be here but we are its like in the great stories mr frodo the ones that really mattered full of darkness and danger they were and sometimes you didnt want to know the end because how could the end be happy how could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened but in the end its only a passing thing this shadow even darkness must pass a new day will come and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something even if you were too small to understand why but i think mr frodo i do understand i know now folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt they kept going because they were holding on to something what are we holding onto sam that theres some good in this world mr frodo and its worth fighting for i watch this scene whenever i feel overwhelmed with all the challenges in life we cant decide the circumstances in our lives but we can and we must choose our character we so often ask the universe for what we want yet we forget it is the universe that asks us for what she wants 
peter jacksons the lord of the rings trilogy although i prefer to think of it as one very long film split into three parts will surely go down in history as one of the greatest cinematic feats of our generation it not only took one of literatures most beloved stories and turned it into a fantastic series of films but it masterfully filmed story that for many years was deemed unfilmable due to the fantasy elements involved and the length the acting was great but the sets and effects were extraordinary they built certain sets a year before filming in order to make them look authentic enough and cities like rivendell minas tirith moria and hobbiton are things of beauty while the tower of orthanc and the land of mordor are eerily wonderful the producers used state of the art computers to render the creatures and fight scenes in the movie using a new program they could create armies of creatures with each type of creature having their own ai giving each race their own weapons design and fighting style the plot of the lord of the rings revolves around the hobbit frodo baggins elijah wood hobbits are similar to humans except they are shorter and choose to live quieter lifestyles than most of the men in middle earth fordos uncle bilbo baggins ian holm gives the young boy a magical ring that makes the wearer invisible unfortunately the ring once belonged to sauron a dark sorcerer who tried to enslave everyone in middle earth he imbued the ring with part of his soul so that when his body was destroyed he could live on and someday regain his body and rule the world again the ring known as the one ring could control the other rings of power that were give out to the kings and leaders of the three most dominant races in middle earth the elves the dwarves and the men frodo along with his friends sam sean astin merry dominic monaghan and pippin billy boyd set out for the elven city of rivendell in order to decide the fate of the ring the council decrees that it must be destroyed but the only way to do it is to return it to mordor saurons home and throw it back into the volcano in which it was forged a fellowship of nine is formed to take the ring to the dark territory it includes the four hobbits gandalf ian mckellan the wizard legolas orlando bloom the elf gimli john rhys davies the dwarf boromir sean bean of gondor and aragorn viggo mortensen the ranger with a mysterious past however saruman christopher lee a wizard and former ally has recently switched sides and is helping sauron hunt the fellowship as the story goes on the fellowship faces trials and is eventually split up with a few helping others fend off the armies of the enemies while frodo and sam head to mordor to destroy the ring their journey is interrupted by the reappearance of gollum smeagol andy serkis the creature that bilbo took the ring from he is untrustworthy and he wants the ring back but only he can sneak the pair into mordor without detection these films are a cinematic marvel and deserved every academy award they received plus many that they didnt new line cinemas took a large gamble when they put these films into production all three were shot simultaneously and if the first one failed they would have been in a lot of trouble fortunately for the studio and the fans these films could not have been any better the versions presented in this set are the extended editions of the films they are not as jackson says a directors cut because he was perfectly happy with the theatrical cut of the films these versions are for the die hard fans while most of the restored footage doesnt fill in major plot holes it helps flesh out the characters a little more as well as put in some things from the books that were cut for time purposes this set is definitely worth the money these are three of the greatest films of all time and they will be remembered for decades to come 
i recieved my copy of the lotr extended dvd trilogy box set today why as i live in australia it came out on december and i pre ordered it from a local online retailer back on december so i got in first i abosutely love this box set it is just about the best thing ive ever seen and the extra features when compared to the standard box set make it worth every cent the highlight in my opinion is the many commentaries that come with the dvds they are very useful in explaning why they did what they did and explain the differences from the books very well almost all the differences were made to make it better for the screen and more appealing to mass audiences while staying true to the spirit of the classic books the extra bonus stuff is very good as well 
first we all paid to see the movie in the theaters then we waited with bated breath for the dvds and rushed out and bought them then out comes the extended version and we all joyfully bought them all again then out came the blu ray but wait whats this theyre releasing the theatrical version hoping well all rush out and buy that and then open our wallets for the fifth time for the extended versions i cant tell you how sick i am of being ripped off this way thankfully id gotten word of the extended versions before i bought the original theatrical releases on dvd and this time i knew better than to buy the theatrical blu ray im so peeved at this trick that i rarely see a movie at the theater anymore if at all i see it at the second run theaters buy a used dvd if im really eager and wait to see if an extended or directors cut dvd will come out so that the movie company only gets to full price fleece me once these shenanigans are only fueling piracy and the movie companies have nobody to blame but themselves 
since the films are top notch specially the extended cuts and these editions have new purpose for the older fans the new documentaries i thought the reviews about this edition were accurate about the needless new documentary well even so i bought the r box and i have to say that im glad i did the documentaries are absolutely for the fans and casual viewers it gives the feeling how the filmming production processes went on it is raw but is soulful in the studios with the designers special effects production people customs peter jackson behind everything that went on screen even the boromirs pocket hilarious stuff wow this is a special movie i know that the disc see dvds are better but this was a behind the scenes camera filming what wasnt supposed to be filmed even if the director costa botes was chosen by peter grab it treasure it even if you have the see dvds or you love the lord of the rings trilogy i know and agree that new line is having a bad behave and absolutely want to pj to direct the hobbit too 
like some die hard fans of the tolkien books i belived the novels to be unfilmable and refused initally to see these movies however against my will i was dragged protesting loudly in to go and see fellowship of the ring after all the movie was filmed in my own backyard pretty much as i used to live mins from minus tirth which was then helms deep at the time of filming the two towers i walked out of theatre hooked then out came the extended versions i saw these on big screen first b i bought the dvds and realsied that they were the movies the peter jackson really filmed and had to edit for the theatre releases even if you havent read the books you should watch these rather than the cinema versions and watch them back to back if you can handle hours in go these are my favourite movies of all time and i can watch them time again and get something new each time not only has peter jackson and co done a stunning job of recreating middle earth as you would have imagined it from reading the novels the ensemble cast is spendid and perfectly cast in their respective roles in the words of actress miranda otto i challenge any woman to watch the two towers and not fall in love with viggo mortenson as aragorn i sure did the appendices are worth watching too esp if you are into film making or just a fan of the books ill shut up now just buy it out of 
 fellowship of the ring we see the history of middle earth and how evil almost triumphed and at the moment of triumph the evil one is cut short some things that are best remembered are forgotten in time the story which is adjusted for a different media than the book must in was being different in form and timing however the essence of the book is captured in this story of the fait of middle earth and man is placed in the hands of a mild rather small creature called a hobbit galadriel for the time would soon come when hobbits would shape the fortunes of all defiantly need to see the extended version as even then many things were left out as tom bomadil the story goes much smother than trying to make sense form the theatrical version to someone who has not read the book i will not go through the story as the thrill of discovery is worth the viewing however they could not have picked better actors for each character especially christopher lee he adds richness to the character of saruman gandalf reminds frodo to spare gollum as bilbo did at other times as in bible stories evil intentions can bring about good situations there is a great attention to detail many times they go out of the way to match description of the book at other times the add what is needed to show the talethe movie is fun to watch and interesting what you may not see so readily is that the formula is that described by joseph campbell of the coming of age of a hero that does not realize he is until he must be proven the special features of the extended edition help understand what they tried to accomplish yet it does not really add or subtract from the tale the two towers this story picks up where fellowship of the ring left off the fellowship apparently divided in its direction and even thought the immediate purposes diverge and converge the urgency of getting the ring to mordor is ever present we are lucky in the fact that j r r tolkien will completely follow each participants path from beginning to end all the wars are covered in detail and the progress of the ring bearer is chronicled new creatures and old vermin reveal themselves as with ramayana we find that every creature has his her function and that there is no black and white in this purpose frodo alludes to this when he thinks of gandalf aragorn and gollum even gandalf tells not to hurt gollum as he may play a larger role in the story that one could imagine the return of the king the greatest stories never endassuming you watch the first two thirds of this story that is sometimes mistaken for a trilogy you will notice that it has been divided a little differently for this presentation we find that shelob who you will be introduced has move to this second of the story as the peter jacksons adaptation of the works of j r r is presented is actually divided better here also sam does not get the opportunity to try out his ring skills mean while back at the ranch oops minas tirith prepares for a major battle aragorn sees dead people we see a flaming denethor john noble if they survive the battle then they must prepare to confront sauron of mordor to distract him from his real threat frodo the absents of the scouring of the shire we still get the feel if not an added extra as the four hobbits having been places and seeing sights that are unfathomable to the other residents of the shire look knowingly at each other comments on the four hours and ten minute version suggests that the is quit a bit more footage that is not seen here and may never be this includes information on many of the characters after the final confrontation do not miss all the great song that gives another dimension to this grate presentation so prepare to enter the crack of doom the lord of the rings
as others have commented there is a slight green tint to the snow on the nd disc of the fellowship of the ring but its not so bad as some have commented and the mountain pass scenes are few and dont last long the quality of the blu ray images and the sound are very very good in my opinion perhaps the best in my experience 
i went the to the theatre to see these movies when they originally came out and i liked them however seeing them all as one continuous movie with the additional scenes is much better peter jackson is the best movie maker since steven spielberg 
this trilogy has been watched in what my daughter calls lord of the rings marathon and she invites her friends shes gone from loving legoles to aragon but she loves them all the three movies in the extended edition lasts for hours and hours but the girls sit through it all orcs dwarfs elfs princesses and of course the ring plus a lot more the battle scenes between good and evil for middle earth are awesome very highly recommended
ive owned this for about months now and only just had a chance to sit down and watch the hour marathon i love the extra hour or so that was crammed into each movie i can see why it was originally cut from the movie but i feel like it expands on the universe perhaps i didnt read correctly when i purchased but i was not aware there were digital copies included in this set 
like many other reviewers i have already reviewed the theatrical releases of each film so i will concentrate on the value of the additions and of the extras cds first and foremost the time added to the theatrical edits is remarkable from minutes for fellowship to an hour for return the value of the additions will depend a lot on how well you know the books since i have read lotr about ten times there was nothing new for me and neither of the two big scenes cut from the book tom bombadil and the scouring of the shire are in the extensions so if you are not familiar with the novel the added scenes will be a genuine treat by way of comparison the minutes added to avatar made a huge addition for me since it was all new material very few of the added scenes are outtakes most were shot especially to add those scenes to flesh out the story i know of one exception which was the short scene at the gates of mordor where aragorn and gandalf parley with the mouth of sauron i looked forward to that scene because the mouth of sauron was played by australian actor bruce spence of mad max fame the scene was removed from the theatrical cut because the mouth of sauron was suggesting that sauron had aquired the ring but the viewing audience new the ring was still safe if i were disappointed with anything it would be that nothing of substance was added to break up the long long long winding down from the distruction of the ring to the last scene as the elven ship departs from the grey havens that was the climax immediately followed by three or more denouments depending on how you count them this is where that hour would have fit nicely since that is exactly what it does in the book it inserts one last dramatic chapter near the end where there is some suspense and a chance that things can still become unravelled for the four hobbits for someone intimately familiar with the story the greater value was to be found in the documentaries on the third and fourth disks for each film as i watched each of these in turn i was simply floored by the size of the crews working on all different aspects from art design planning costumes props set construction miniatures life size bodies especially a lifesize figure of an oliphant mumakil corpse for the battle of pelannor fields and that battle was even longer than in the theatrical release which since i just now checked is far far longer than the description in the novel it was astounding to see that some people such as artists costumers model makers and cgi crews spent up to seven years on the film the main actors spent close to years in new zealand including extra shots for the extended edition the level of detail to capture a very small effect is remarkable the costumes of the principle characters most especially theoden were so elaborate they had detailed designs on the inside which you could not even see there were two men who spent over two years doing nothing but making chain mail vests out of small rings of plastic pipe lots of people worked and hour days one lead cgi artist spend his whole week christmas holiday constructing the computer model of barad dur so that it could realistically be destroyed the job of the principal actors especially those who appeared in all three films seemed akin to spending a year in a marine boot camp and john rhys davies had it the worst as he was allergic to his prosthetics covering his face in a dramatic scene where aragorn gimli and legolas are running after merry and pippin in rohan all three mortenson rhys davies and bloom were injured in some way but they soldiered on to keep the shooting on schedule the coordination of documentary segments from film to film was well done as each one begins with the way tolkien conceived of the story in each book how design was done how sets costumes and props were made and how each was shot i was floored when i saw the size of some of the sets for helms deep virtually the whole fortress was built in a quarry which looked a lot like the middle earth terrain the grandest set was minas tirith it was the largest film set ever built in the southern hemisphere by the time i finished watching all the work that went into the films i found it delightful to relive the moment at the academy awards when stephen spielberg opened the envelope for best picture and said its a clean sweep 
unlike many reviewers here its obvious why each film is spread over two discs extremely high bitrate video these films average mbps using avc of course ive never seen any film this high and the resulting video quality is spectacular most blu ray films have peak bitrates of around mbps though this is seldom seen on discs using vc compression i saw peak rates on this lotr set in the low s one other note the packaging on this set is outstanding with a strong magnetically sealed box containing three separate five disc packages one final gentle note to movie reviewers on amazon we dont need or want a review of the movie there are plenty of outstanding professionally written and credible reviews available online please just review the picture and sound quality the special features or things like packaging 
the quality of the picture is incredible its so clean so crisp so colorful the sound in other hand although is superb i do not notice a bit improvement over the dts version of the dvd my receiver does a great job with the dts sound so the only difference im noticing is that the sound is a little bit more clean refined with less vibration the delivery was spot on as always thank you amazon for this purchase 
the lord of the rings trilogy extended dvds is in my estimation the greatest motion picture achievement of all time why you may ask exactly what is my opinion based on let me explain my reasons the first and greatest hurdle is the difficultly of adapting a film from a book or series of books in this case without doing damage to the literary vision of the author you could produce an excellent movie yet fail miserably at remaining true to the original source ask any longtime hardcore fan if the films retained tolkeins vision im confident youll receive a resounding yes secondly the lord of the rings boasts the best special effects to date yet despite the technological grandeur of its accomplishments the story and the characters within it remain first and foremost in importance its this retaining of its human or hobbit for that matter and emotional base within all the fantasmagoria abounding that makes it so profoundly successful thirdly considering the sheer length of the combined films it would seem an utter impossibility for any film s to maintain its audience interest for so long a duration of time not only does lord of the rings accompish the impossible but it actually draws the viewer deeper into its fantasy landscape everything else magnificent cast haunting mesmerizing soundtrack director crew production values the list is endless nobody ever thought it was possible for any film to truly do justice to tolkeins literary masterpiece fortunately director peter jackson didnt see it that way monumental epic timeless unforgetable essential
you dont have to be a hardcore rings fan to enjoy this movie definately worth the price not only just for the many many extra scenes that help you understand the movie better but just for the behind the scenes special features if nothing else very thankful that peter jackson included so much behind the scenes footage makes this the greatest trilogy set out there and i have to agree it is definately worth more than five stars 
the extended editions for this movie trilogy are the greatest dvds ever released what other movies dvds can extend oscar worthy movies by and still retain all their original charm and magic the extended scenes and new parts of these movies are not just useless filler and garbage that was cut to make the movie better the cut scenes are all superb and really make these movies that much more enjoyable especially the new scenes of return of the king from the packaging to the picture quality these editions are the cream of the crop if you enjoyed the books or the movies in any way then you owe it to yourself to buy this box set 
this set is comprised of the lotr films but presented in their standard theatrical release form meaning no extended or newly added scenes while the movies are undeniably and unarguable as being classics this trilogy package is probably best suited for newer viewers of the films who havent bought any of the lotr films but if you want to get all films i strongly suggest getting all individually on the extended version you wont be wasting the extra money because each film contains a generous amount of extended or newly added scenes that add not only depth but characters and more story to the films i do not recommend this package to lotr fanatics or completists only to those who want to get all standard lotr films in one shot at sort of a discount price 
this set includes the extended versions of the lord of the rings trilogy including the fellowship of the ring the two towers and the return of the king the three movies follow the books they are based on with only a few liberties and omissions most notably the exclusion of tom bombadil the scripting casting settings special effects and directing are among the best ever for all three movies the cinematography and sound score is truly breathtaking in places and they bring to life the spirit of the books in a way that i never thought would be possible the extended versions make the movies even more enjoyable since they tell more of the story that had to be left out when shown in the theaters the bonus material is enjoyable providing insights into the filming process special effects and the actors viewpoints during the filming this set was everything i hoped it would be and it was great having a three day marathon watching the whole series with my family highly recommended cfh
the picture and sound are way better than dvd and the extras are great you could spend all day watching the movie and extras on just one of the movies 
the making of the lord of the rings trilogy may constitute one of the greatest stories in film history take an unknown director a cast of mostly unknown actors move them to new zealand for months of filming use an obscure special effects company named after a native insect and stake nearly million dollars and the reputation and existence of a movie studio on it somehow working granted director peter jackson whose love for the material and unwillingness to condescend is apparent and his cast had great material to work with the beloved novels of john ronald reuel tolkien complete with a dedicated fan base that gave the trilogy instant name recognition and some credibility the question became could this kiwi director and his group of unknowns create films that would satisfy both tolkiens fans and the general moviegoer would this be star wars for this generation or the most memorable flop ever well as we all know the lord of the rings has gone on to net oscars billions in box office returns critical acclaim and popular appeal fans all over the globe have embraced this most incredible achievement and its timeless messages giving it the kind of universal appeal rarely seen even in our more open and global society although some tolkien fans have taken issue with some of the changes wrought by jackson many have welcomed these films as grand representations of tolkiens work and have applauded the renewed attention it has brought to the books the greatest amount since the trilogy was embraced by the sixties generation its the rare pop culture phenomenon that also has highbrow literary appeal the films represent an extraordinary trilogy but each one stands alone as a great film of the three return of the king may be the best not due to its eleven oscars but due to its perfect blend of heroism epic action and emotion this is true of all three films but it is greatest in king the battle of pelennor fields sets the bar higher than any film ever directors will probably spend the next decade attempting to top it king also packs an emotional punch largely due to the familiarity we now have with these characters and the sheer desperation of frodos quest which begins to claim both his health and his sanity if the film has a flaw its the extended ending but thats forgivable perhaps the only problem with fellowship is that it begins slowly unraveling gradually in a way that may seem tedious to some however this is necessary to introduce characters and plot having cate blanchett as galadriel open fellowship with an introduction that explains the film s backstory and introduces the conflict to those unfamiliar to tolkiens work was a stroke of genius towers suffers from a somewhat uneven midsection but redeems itself with the amazing battle of helms deep which required three months of night shoots and a fascinating film stealing performance by andy serkis as the twisted gollum favorite moments the balrog wow boromirs last stand act of penance helms deep the march of the ents pelennor fields the madness of denethor shelob wow again the courage of samwise gamgee time and again as ensemble acting goes its hard to top these films each actor was tasked with giving emotional heft and believability to their roles embodying characters dear to many and each one succeeded i cannot think of a single weak performance in the trilogy every part is perfectly cast with some standouts ian mckellen makes gandalf a gruff but wise compassionate and endearing character quiet soft spoken viggo mortensen who took method acting to new heights by sleeping in his outfit and dwelling in the woods at times is ideal as the reluctant ranger king aragorn elijah wood gives frodo both emotional depth and strength serkis as gollum veteran actor christopher lee adds gravitas and menace to his role as saruman and sean astin who steals nearly every scene in king makes the steadfast and loyal sam come alive many critics and some fans had issues with kings multiple endings but having spent more than nine hours with these characters it was nice to grant them a long goodbye there are some flaws in the films however though they are largely minor jacksons direction is first rate though he over uses slow motion and tracking shots im being picky i know some have taken serious issue with the exclusion of the barrow wight and tom bombadil from fellowship the presence of elves at helms deep and the changes made to faramirs character in towers the alterations to denethor and the somewhat foreshortened ending of king sans the scouring of the shire that concluded the book some of these have been amended or explained in the extended editions and some are left out altogether the only change that bothered me was the coarsening of faramirs character why although some see bilbo as the character most like tolkien the author once told a friend i think it was charles williams though i may be wrong that faramir was the character closest to him in nature altering faramir to be more like his brother and less the scholarly reluctant warrior he was in the books may make for more dramatic cinema but it does lessen the man as represented by tolkien this however is rectified somewhat in the towers extended edition by his brief soliloquy over a fallen soldier and his eventual refusal to be ruled by either the ring or his father of all the changes this is the only one that i have trouble reconciling but it does not alter or change my perception of these films as extraordinary epics fans of the star wars and matrix trilogies may argue with me about this but i have to say that this now ranks as the greatest trilogy of films ever made and is one of the landmark accomplishments in cinema history sorry this review was so long 
please describe the audio and video quality of any blu ray you review thanks to those who do this the video quality was excellent one of the best blu rays i own i have no complaints about it at all the dts hd master audio soundtrack was also excellent i have a system and i couldnt tell the difference between and in fact this sounded better than most blu rays ive listened to the only complaint i have about the sound is the low level of the center speaker channel i have to keep my finger on the remote because i have to have the volume up to hear the soft voices and i have to turn the volume down during the action scenes they should have made the center channel louder the time of duration on these movies is deceptive the actual movies are shorter than listed because the they have at least minutes of credits at the end listed are all the members of the lotr fan club which takes a while i dont know how accurate these movies are because it has been over years since i have read the books i know the story of the hobbit isnt part of the lotr books but i think with movies that last over hours could have spent at least seconds explaining how bilbo got the ring from gollum i am not a real big fan of the lotrs and found myself having a difficult time paying attention during all of this at the end i thought watching them was worthwhile but after spending over hours watching them i wasnt about to expore the additional feature discs 
well i wont comment on the superb acting special effects directing casting scripting etc as all the buzz and awards have done that for me but the more of this i watch the more i want to see the longer the movies are the shorter they seem this is one of the few movies that actually makes me feel like im there like middle earth is real and all i have to do is go to new z to see it i almost expect to see minas tirith and aragorn there and to think they actually dismantled the set how much would you pay to spend a week in a hobbit hole in the shire followed by a hike in new z to rivendell to view the waterfalls where the elves and the fellowship never mind this extended version is really the only way to watch lotr and it has been discontinued if you have the shorter version youre missing a lot of pieces of the puzzle youre missing lots of middle earth history you owe yourself this one 
for the longest time the star wars series has been my favorite movie series of all time and i doubted that any movie would be able to change my mind however the more i watch these movies i am almost to the point where i will admit that i enjoy the lord of the rings series more than the star wars series which i literally grew up with i wont go into much detail in reviewing the actual movies short of the extended scenes because it has already been covered extensively in other reviews this review will focus mainly on the box set itself and the extras my first experience with lord of the rings was watching the animated version back in the early s with my brother since then i have always been interested in the story but never to the point where i went back and read the book even when it was announced that the story was going to be made into a movie it sparked some interest but not to the point where it was a must see and certainly didnt think it would be better than star wars when i eventually saw the theatrical versions of the movie i was hooked all over again and rushed out to purchase the theatrical trilogy as well as this extended platinum edition i dont buy movies much anymore but lord of the rings was an absolute must the extended scenes in this movie unlike other dvd extras actually go along with the story and fills in some holes or things that werent covered in the original versions due to obvious time constraints while tolkien purists have valid complaints that the movie version does not follow the book completely what peter jackson produced from tolkiens extensive work of lord of the rings is nothing short of amazing i have watched these movies many times and i am still planning to watch them again perhaps a lord of the rings marathon that i watch all extended editions in one day on top of this these movies have made me very interested in reading tolkiens complete works in addition to lord of the rings out of all the box sets i have i have never actually watched the extras outside of the alternate endings of some films however it was by accident that i started watching the appendices of this series i was sitting around one day and decided to pop in the first appendices after watching fellow ship of the ring for the th time and i just could not stop watching this led me to watch the appendices of each subsequent film after watching the actual movie long story short the appendices explain how nearly everything was made in the trilogy and its hard not to appreciate all the hard work jackson the cast extras film crew and countless others put into making these movies a huge success one good example is how two brave souls spent the entire filming time of the three files making chain mail by hand to the point where they no longer have finger prints on the tips of their fingers in addition to showing how each film was made the appendices go into detail of tolkiens life himself and his inspiration in creating middle earth the appendices are an integral part of the box set and i cant believe it took me years to finally watch them visually the box set is also the best i have ever seen each movie is separated in to a book like case that flips out to display the cds for the extended movie version and for the appendices the dvds are stored in a clear holder so you can see maps of middle earth through the clear covering on top of this each book has a detailed maps stored in the pockets close the book and you can see great detail was placed in that as well the covering is highly textured and the binding has an authentic worn look these three books are stored into another textured outside cover that simply displays the words the lord of the rings on the front when i first bought this set nearly years ago i took special care to be sure it was well taken care of but over the years and a move i ended up losing the outside case as well as some box inserts usually i would have just dealt with it but for some reason i felt the need to buy this set all over again after tearing up the house searching unsuccessfully for the missing pieces i now have two box sets with the newer one stored unopened in a safe place so i wont lose it again the attention to detail in creating this boxed set is obvious and its hard for one not to appreciate the final product unfortunately this box set is no longer available from the manufacturer but it still can be had from amazon sellers as well as sites like ebay just be sure you read the description to be sure you are getting exactly what is pictured many sellers will try to mislead you and you end up with an incomplete set and others will try to gouge you with ridiculously high prices due to the fact its no longer available retail in any case this box set is a must have for fans of the movie if you liked the original theatrical versions you would be doing yourself a great disservice for not picking this set up as well there has been talk that this will be re released in a blu ray version and you better believe ill be purchasing that version as well this set gets my full recommendation for the movies the appendices and the box set itself stars in every category 
wow thats almost blasphemy for me to say after all i grew up in a star wars world but i would have to say after watching all three of the extended edition dvds that this exceeds star wars as the best trilogy in movie history what can i say about these dvds they are nothing short of incredible i have to admit that i had not read any of jrr tolkiens work prior to seeing the fellowship of the ring in the theater and to be honest had not really heard or seen anything about the story to prepare me for the movie which i sat through with my mouth agape trying to drink in the scenery dialogue and action which was being thrown at me the dvds are probably the most comprehensive of any dvd out there its like you the viewer are allowed behind the scenes behind the cameras on location to see how this or that was done there are so many dvds out there for movies that i wish i could see how where what why when that didnt pay even a fraction of the attention to the dvd release as these well worth every penny the best thing about the lord of the rings special extended dvd trilogy is that peter jackson himself was behind the entire process creating new scenes adding deleted scenes and new score to make the story flow as if it were being released as a new movie into theaters if you enjoyed the lord of the rings movies definitely buy the extended dvd versions 
i could spend hours and hours and pages and pages examineing and professing my love for this movie series and story stories the cast is unmatched the director did a brilliant job and background is as rich as the stories this movie really captures the spirit and soul that i remember from the books the dvd collection is neat it has some added footage which i enjoy but am glad was not included on the theatre version as their seats are not as comfortable as mine the dvds also have some added features which include a little history on j r tolkien his times the inklings cambridge and other things that inspired the writing of these books the dvds also include interviews with director peter jackson and some in the making stuff all in all if you are looking to get the lord of rings trilogy on dvd then there is little or no choice ofcourse you should read the books first it is the natural progression finally the dvds come smartly and attractively packeged in something that i expect will last 
please people dont waste your money on the theatrical version buy the one with the most content instead stop movie studios from milking us of our hard earned money 
i havent watched the other two yet but judging on the first extended edition i dont even have to i speak for this entire package when i say its one of the best if not the best movie package i have ever bought powerful moving emotional epic this series rocks my socks off i am very greatful to have it among my dvd collection and this is coming from someone who has never read tokens books but dont worry i plan to purchase them and read them happy viewing 
there were some people who complained loudly that the original films in this series were too long to begin with i guess theres no pleasing some people as im sure they have some major objections to the additions made to the trilogy here actually if one just sits and watches the additions make the story flow so much better from one film into another that one cant imagine seeing the shorter cut up theatrical versions again with pleasure the best way to see these films is one right after another on consecutive nights so that the emotional punch is the hardest the emotional impact is the real saving grace of the story and there is a lot of it to be seen much has been made of the special effects in the trilogy and yes they are indeed special the only comparison to the effects in these films is with the original star wars films the innovations the use of generations old tricks to deceive the eyes all of it done with class and imagination the casting of the films is also a strong point each actor is perfect in their role and you really cant imagine anyone else playing them now the location work is beyond beautiful the countryside of new zealand actually becomes another cast member as many sweeping shots are presented of pristine mountain ranges beautiful rivers and wide plains all in all this trilogy has become for many the ultimate film trilogy above even the godfather series how one trilogy compares to another is purely subjective of course but one cant argue with the box office take and the critcal acclaim these films garnered this will stand as the ultimate fantasy film series in film history and rightfully so as this collection has all three extended edtions in one set it is definately a great bargain really i think this set should be a basic in any film buffs movie collection as the trilogys place in film history is assured 
what is the true meaning of frodos errand no less than the redemption of humankind indeed we do live in what is almost the day of the orc is our world today that much less a hell than the burning plains of mordor where the all seeing eye of sauron ever torments inevitably the overwhelming threat of doom which we in fear and greed and obsessive heartlessness of a gollum or any other maker of evil have created will have to be faced probably in this generation or the next the climactic battle will occur for this reason if not for many others this film demands to be seen do you share enough in the vision of peace the humility of the shire the courage of aragon to allign with the forces of good for not the armies of the dead shall claim this victory but those of the living for over four decades people attempted to covert tolkiens masterpiece into the great cinema which we all knew it could be peter jackson et al have done a commendable job with very challenging material and the usual monetary and temporal contraints 
this is a title that you cannot ignore in fact it should be a mainstay in any serious film fans collection whether it be in dvd or blu ray format even though i owned all three extended editions on dvd i must say that the blu ray transfer is really pristine and good for those who dont own the dvd sets do purchase them but for the rest of us dvd owners is it worth the upgrade to be frank i felt a little underwhelmed basically they are the same movies and i dont feel the magic as i have once felt in the cinemas the extras are essentially the same and even on the same disc format dvd to put it bluntly if your television is of average size inch and below like mine it is hard to recapture the cinematic magic but if you are watching your movies on a projector screen inch with a digital projector then knock yourself out 
if you loved the theatrical release as we all did you must see the extended directors cut there are moments that were left on the cutting room floor due to time constraints that are must sees the extra features showcase everything from casting production and even an indepth look at how jrr tolkien came up with his original masterpiece novel 
this is a nice set i already own the previously released sets theatrical and extended cuts but im getting two of them for friends for christmas who dont own any of these movies yet i guess theyre not the die hard fan that i am its an affordably priced set too 
one of the most beloved trilogies in history has finally received the high definition treatment and man oh man is it good the special effects of the films were starting to get outdated and didnt hold up as well as some would have hoped this set changes all that the movies look and sound so great youll get the feeling youre watching them for the first time while the set doesnt have the beautiful artwork contained in the individual sets its still a joy to look through the extended editions really add a lot to the stories and the special features are top notch seriously theres so much stuff here youll be glued to your tv for hours mesmerized by the process behind these terrific films if youve been contemplating getting this set on bd even if you have it on dvd go for it you will not be disappointed 
lord of the rings is one of my favorite movie series of all time and this bluray version is absolutely gorgeous first a couple of technical comments about the bluray version i have the extended dvd version of lotr as well each movie is split into two bluray discs for a simple reason this allows for a lower degree of compression so that the native resolution and visual quality of the movies can be better maintained the resolution is especially important if your system has the software to tweak the sharpness and color settings and your screen has a higher resolution than the native p of the bluray i watch all my movies on my desktop computer with inch x native resolution monitor the result is an outstanding degree of sharpness without graininess throughout the movie better than i can get for my avatar bluray i can see every hair and skin cell it seems in the close up shots regarding the comments from others about the green tint in this bluray it must be your bluray player i have not had any problems but then the video quality of my computer system can be adjusted at three levels the monitor the nvidia graphics card and the video playing software despite the sharp increase in resolution there are surprisingly few cgi or other glitches visible almost certainly somebody went through this movie with a fine tooth comb to clean up the high resolution details i only noticed a few minor glitches still isildurs scene at the beginning where he puts on the ring and vanishes still looks like it was shot in front of a green screen theres a subtle mismatch between his lighting and coloring and that of the background the army of the dead move a bit too cgi whenever they ride out in a horde and at the end where the pirate ships have an unnatural looking interface with the water now for some thoughts about lotr and this movie series it has long been apparent that tolkien based lotr on the history and mythology of great britain and europe and so it finally dawned on me one day that numenor spelled backwards is ronemun a near anagram for roman and the numenoreans must indeed have been the romans who invaded middle earth great britain the serial invasions of britain by various european peoples and the themes of constant warfare and of existing people being displaced by new peoples are integral to both lotr and the history of great britain history is written by the victors and the losers are invariably demonized in those accounts and so today the romans are remembered in much the same light as the noble numenoreans of lotr and their enemies remembered as savages it is worth noting that despite their frequent portrayal as the founders of modern western european civilization the romans slaughtered and enslaved millions in their conquests and displaced vast numbers of peoples it is thus possible to see that buried beneath the themes of good vs evil in lotr is the deeper story of human evolution through eternal warfare were the wildmen of dunland truly evil or were they just fighting to regain their lands taken from them by the numenoreans and rohirrim the true story of queen boudica and the iceni versus the romans comes to mind here were the orcs and goblins and uruk hai truly deformed evil monsters or were they just coexistent species of near humans fighting for their right to exist in middle earth we know now that the line that became modern humans evolved alongside many other side branches of near humans in what surely must have been a darwinian death struggle are the myths of such monsters merely a racial memory from human pre history as i watch this wonderful movie series once again i do see things in a different light i had just finished hbos game of thrones series which also featured sean bean in a another role as a sword wielding nobleman both stories are set in similar fantasy worlds based on medieval era europe but their story themes are quite different lotr has a simple linear plotline detailing the triumph of good over evil you know the good guys will remain good guys the bad guys are utterly evil and then there are those few in between who struggle with being on one side or the other the good guys win in lotr those in between who fail to overcome the temptations of evil are destroyed evil is destroyed and everybody who is good goes on to live happily ever after although not all stay in middle earth having created such powerful forces of evil in his tale to accomplish that happy ending tolkien had to resort to several deus ex machina plot devices to save the overwhelmed good guys the charge of eomers riders straight into the long pikes of the uruk hai to save helms deep not likely to be successful in the real world the great eagles to save gandalf and frodo sam and the army of the dead to save gondor game of thrones is very different none more so than the character of sean bean who plays a thoroughly decent honest and good man and yet comes to an untimely end who is good and evil in this tale cannot be so easily sorted out as everyone has a different agenda and it is just a mass free for all struggle for power and survival the few who appear to be truly good in this tale get crushed in the struggle history and life are indeed more like game of thrones than lotr but in my heart i still love lotr more than something like game of thrones which although fascinating to watch makes me squirm lotr remains closer to an idealized fantasy myth world there are some things i wish for though i wish saruman could have had a chance to tell his tale of why he chose the path of science and industrialization which after all is what produced technology like this bluray movie why he chose to ally himself with these species of near humans and breed the uruk hai i wish the wildmen and the easterlings had a chance to tell their tale for surely they had reasons to ally themselves with saruman and sauron there are hints of this back story in the appendices and other works of tolkien but only hints there is another tale to be told there im sure 
reading through a bunch of customer comments on the new blu ray extended edition of the lord of the rings there was one recurring theme that i never cease to discover with these things many viewers are apparently seeing shortcomings in the visual transfers that cause it to fall short of their best hopes for the set my comment is from the perspective of a serious home theater buff we are talking here about the really giant screen front projection type of viewing i have extensively spot checked the new blu ray release and though i might grant that some future transfer might actually exceed the perfection of this one its hard for me personally to imagine such a thing i wont be needing to see anything better the shimmering high resolution clarity the vibrance of the color the rich clean audio all combine to make a perfect theater experience of jacksons instant classic some by the way have expressed amazement that he could have effectively added so much footage to the original theatrical versions what i believe to be the case is that these extended versions actually reflect the directors original concept of the film he had certainly included these scenes in the original shooting schedule and clearly he had hoped to include them in the that movies were initially released if you know about the resistance that distributors and exhibitors always mount against long movies you wouldnt be surprised to learn that cutting down of the complete movies would certainly have been what these people demanded thank heaven the full length versions were something that could be managed by the director and his crew better late than never 
first if you already have the theatrical release of this trilogy and are wondering if the extended editions are worth buying the answer is yes the extra content contained in these extended editions all add greatly to the story it all enhances the storyline and help flesh it out more in a few places these are not just some deleted scenes stuffed back in just to make the movies longer or banal filler but were scenes that had to removed mostly due to the time constraints of watching a movie in a theater remember that the theatrical versions were about hours each anyway with the extended editions there is about min min and min of extra footage in each movie of the trilogy respectively that would have been quite the marathon to endure in a theater but the length will be fine in the comfort of your home where you can stop and start at your leisure i already owned the dvd version of these extended editions but i decided to upgrade to blu ray there are some movies that i own on dvd that i would not worry about upgrading but considering this is one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time in my opinion anyway i think seeing it in the highest possible resolution and with the best quality sound is worth the extra money the sweeping scenery and high quality special effects will leave you that much more in awe in when viewed in hi def in case you are saying well duh of course the blu ray will be better quality than the dvd that is not always the case because there have been some instances in other films where the blu ray transfer left sub par video audio on the discs this is not the case with this collection and it is of the highest quality all of the extra content available on the dvd version is also on the blu ray which means after you buy this you can find another good home for your dvd version and clear up your shelf space if you have the dvd already also there is even a little extra bonus content on the blu ray so you at least get a little something new for your money the bottom line is that i think this is the definitive collection of this trilogy released to date and is absolutely worth purchasing 
well theres really not much to review regarding this release its a blu ray upgrade of the previous extended edition dvds all the same features all films split onto two discs due to four commentary tracks the only thing new on this set is that each film comes with a fifth disc containing the hour and half to two hour docs from the lord of the rings third dvd release that contained the extended and theatrical versions on one flipper disc and the second disc had this documentary now added to the extended edition package the new docs are really good and really comprehensive its really cool to feel like a fly on the wall while this massive production is being put into motion the package from the dvds was awesome and this blu ray package is likewise with added awesomeness of this fifth disc fly on the wall docs obviously having the amazing upgraded sound and picture is also worth the upgrade its weird how splitting these extended films onto two discs actually improves the pictures ever so slightly from the theatrical version blu rays which looked and sounded amazing in the first place now this set got a lot of negative buzz before it was even released due to the fact that the films are spread out onto two blu ray discs and the fact that all the special features are on standard dvds now i do get the initial frustration with this i really do but i also think that most are overreacting more than just a tad i mean cmon the dvds look great and is it really that big of a deal to switch discs an hour and half into any of the films i mean who has the time to watch all three hour to four hour films in one sitting anyway do any of you have lives or jobs firstly well address the dvd factor the discs picture and audio qaulity is great on an hd tv the upgrade from the blu ray player really doesnt make me long for a blu ray copy of these features the only problem with it being on a dvd format is how much easier dvds are to be scratched and uplayable compared to blu ray discs well i dont know about you guys but ive had well over a thousand dvds in my apartment for the last ten plus years and ive never scratched or had any of them ruined and become unplayable in any way really so is that really that big an issue i dont think so okay onto the fact that the films are split onto two blu rays yes i too wouldve liked to have the extended editions on one disc but it really doesnt bother me too much that they are two i actually wish jackson knowing that they were going to be split had added some intermission title cards and intermission howard shore music to go with it and make it feel like old epic movies of the days of yore ive never personally sat and watched one of these extended cuts in one sitting i really dont mind switching discs one should get up and move around after an hour and a half anyway right also for those who really want these extended films on one disc fret not i garuntee that they will release a third version of these films individually just like they did with the dvds and they will be both versions and they will be on one blu ray without the commentaries taking up precious room i couldnt have these films without the commentaries ive only sampled the actors and technical commentaries but ive listened to the one with director peter jackson and his co writers phillipa boyens and fran walsh many times it repeats some of the copious docs info but also gives you more tid bits and gets you inside the filmmakers intentions regarding why something was done and why somethings were rerearranged or written regarding the adaption its really great so basically the split disc thing really doesnt bug me i want the commentaries and i wont be buying this again when the individual one disc blu ray versions are eventually released which i would expect them around the same time as the first hobbit films release now i did previously buy the theatrical version blu rays and i did know that the extended edition blu rays were coming out when i did this why i want both versions of each film and i like the special features included on the theatrical editions that are not included on the extended editions yup im that much of a nerd when it comes to this stuff lord of the rings and the hobbit were some of the first dense reading i ever did when i was child these stories are a big part of my life and my virgining imagination peter jackson was one of my most admired filmmakers when i was a teen due to braindead and heavenly creatures so his involvement was bliss and i think most of us can agree that he did a really good job with these films the theatrical films are really different films as well they are paced more like a movie and better in that regard they get to the point and consolidate things to be snappier and they work that way i would show the theatrical versions of these films to rings virgins the extended cuts are great but they play more like a book they stop and start constantly they are loaded with bits that add nothing to the story but thats okay if youre a big fan they also have some great character moments for some of the minor characters especially gimli merry and pippin i love them and appreciate the care that went into them as a fan of the book i can put aside how films should be paced to enjoy some great imagery and laguid character moments that reflect the beloved books plus jackson howard shore and the editors have not just plopped the deleted scenes back into the film not all the deleted scenes were put back in as youll find out if you listen to the directors commentary they actually finished effects and inserted the scenes as if they were always intended to be there its seamless i dont consider these extended cuts to be so called directors cut the theatrical versions are my directors cuts says peter jackson fellowship of the ring and the two towers are the best of the extended editions return of the king has a lot of great stuff but there are a few scenes that shouldve stayed cut for example the scene with the mouth of sauron is cool to see especially if youve read the books but its seems rather pointless in the flow of the film the scene has the mouth proclaiming that frodo is dead and making somber predictions problem is that we the audience already know frodo is alive due to previous scenes now in the book the time jumping nature of tolkiens prose its not clear that frodo is alive until after this meeting the scene is cool but seems rather pointless the second edition that really muddies up return of the king is the extended sequence in cave of the dead in the theatrical version arogorn asks for the ghosts help and then the we cut without an answer in this version we see the ghosts agreeing and then charging a ship to commandeer it this takes tension from the climax if we know they said yes then whats the point of making the final battle seem lost we know the ghosts are definitely coming so were just waiting for it sure one could say we knew that anyway even without seeing their compliance to arogorn but i really enjoy the theatrical version of this scenario better the greatest edition to the extended edition of return of the king is the death of sauramon i hated that christopher lee didnt get a proper final scene in two towers or return of the king merry and pippin just reference that hes been locked in his tower while christopher lees last scene throws off the pacing for the opening of return and doesnt work as a grand finale to two towers its still better at least to me to see him end and have closure on that evil character wonderfully played by lee also the best part of the extended cut of two towers among man more gollum stuff is more treebeard treebeard comes off more like a fully developed character compared to the theatrical version thats all ill say about that the special features are the same so i wont go into them in any detail if youve owned the previous dvd editions then you know what they are i will say that my favorite part of the special features beyond the great director and writers commentaries are the first docs on the appendices first discs for each film the first docs go into tolkkien his history how he got the idea for these books his war years his great loves and his struggle to get his trilogy published it also seques into the the filmmakers talking about why and what they added or changed in the books for the film versions it also goes into some of their additions being merely stuff they culled from the appendices in each novel if you dont watch any other features these three docs are the best if youre interested runner up for best special feature would be the two towers second appendices disc that focuses on the creation of gollum truly revolutionary in terms of acting and special effects my favorite piece of info covered is how they went back to their own detriment to redesign gollum to look more like andy serkis who was initially only called in to be the characters voice not only that but even though they did motion capture sequences with andy serkis and shot empty plates with just the live action actors minus serkis they ended up using the scenes with andy serkis in his licra suit they erased him out and added gollum while mimicing what he did live on set again this cost them more money and time but they found gollums performance as well as the live actors performances were much better in those takes very cool and interesting i really believe that the animators and serkis shouldve been nominated for best supporting actor thats all if you can deal with main complaints this is an obvious double dip if you bought the original blu ray release and didnt think this was coming then youre just a tad nieve im a fan of both versions for various reasons and i love that i now have them both an dtons of extras that tell you everything you wanted to know and things that you didnt even think you wanted to know regarding how these amazing films were made im a happy quadripple dipping fan 
it had been three years since id last watched my dvds of lotr when the blu ray extended editions became available i debated making the leap my policy has been to not double buy something i had already purchased on dvd this was going to be the exception because of the extra footage the reviews were such that it was apparent that the added material was not just crap swept off the editing room floor and jammed in that was not the case here and the reviews were accurate its like watching the films again for the first time obviously the quality on blu ray was amazing both picture and sound were awesome on my led watching these films will be an annual event for me brilliant 
if enough of us show our approval of the extended over theatrical then maybe well get it sooner if it does nothing else i hope they lose sleep over a making a slightly lesser fortune if that fails at least we sleep better from not selling out 
fellowship of the ring this seems to be the only film that doesnt necessarily benefit from the extended edition footage it feels like the theatrical version was certainly the version that was intended to be seen while the footage is good it certainly doesnt need to be there to enjoy the film regardless it definitely doesnt detract from the enjoyment of the movie overall two towers the second film of the set has never had the ability to stand on its own whether it is the theatrical or extended edition of the film and that may be an issue for middle part films almost in general the battles and action are absolutely amazing though and this film was certainly intended to be seen w the extended edition footage return of the king an absolute modern classic and a prime example of st century film making its only real downfall remains the multiple endings even w a hour runtime this movie never slows down everything added to the movie feels welcome and really completes the experience somehow improving on the original theatrical release this movie was the one that i believe solidified lotr as some of the most important films of the s video fellowship of the rings some shots seemed unintentionally soft and undefined but still greatly improved over the previous release the one major issue stemming from this film for me was that there was some noticeable dnr during scenes in lothl oacute rien overall this movie looks fantastic especially concerning scenes from the mines of moria im also not seeing the boosted green cyan tint that fan boys reviewers alike seem to be raging about it looks to about the same color as i remember it two towers whatever issues linger over two towers certainly seem to be related to the source material because this is the best this film will probably ever look on home video return of the king one of the best looking bd of the year so far especially considering some footage is more the years old return of the king is reference quality video that even improved on its previous bd release which was already practically perfect audio amazing your tv sound system is going to get quite the workout extras i wish they could have all been in hd but there is more then enough here for anyone who wishes for the complete lotr movie experience i havent gotten the chance to delve into them yet but what is there will certainly take any normal person days to sift through overall a huge improvement over any previous release of the films this is the best lotr has looked and sounded on home video im afraid that the cynics want to point out flaws that really dont exist just to throw everyone who really loves the films off this set is as good as its ever going to get unless the films are given k or k transfers for the next release which you know is inevitable im thinking itll be a theatrical ee combo release in conclusion if youre a fan or these films are new to you pick this up asap as this is the definitive release of a modern classic 
i already reviewed the regular motion picture trilogy containing the non extended editions of the legendary lord of the rings masterpieces on one set however this newest edition is a grand improvement on the previous edition this item is a much much better investment than the old theatrical counterparts and is perhaps the greatest dvd purchase one will likely ever make a lot directors cut scenes are usually just added footage that doesnt do a whole lot to add onto the theatrical edition of movies with examples like star wars manhunter or even most of the aliens movies as well the extra material is just that extras that wouldnt kill me to never see again its a totally different story altogether with the lord of the rings movies altogether while the regular theatrical editions were mind blowing the extended cuts of the same films do wonders in fleshing out the story and expanding the characters a lot more several characters that were not much more than background people are shown much more screen time stories are greatly expanded other scenes are much more meaningful and the movies overall have a totally different feel altogether thanks to all of the extra footage that was not included on the theatrical editions now as i watch them the old editions of them are rendered almost completely obsolete due to the chopped up nature of them i sometimes wonder if peter jackson grimaced when he had to leave a lot of extra shots out of the movies to fit them onto the theatres when they were released fellowship has minutes of extra footage included to a length of and a half hours the two towers was extended minutes to a total of hours and minutes and finally the return of the king is extended by a grand minutes and the ultimate result is a whopping hours and minutes long i dont know about you but i dont know how one can make a longer movie like this but jackson did it the grand total of all three extended editions is at least an astronomical hours long this is just the movies themselves as for all of the extras on the extended editions there are over a days worth of extras for surf through on the latter two discs of each film set the things on them are too great to explain in detail with this review whether you buy them individually or all at once on this massive gift set the lord of the rings trilogy goes down as the greatest trilogy of all time you could not make a better purchase i swear it 
 ive been seeing a lot of negative reviews for the re release of these three films on dvd a lot of them are from people that dont even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts and want the documentaries on the new ones but dont want to purchase them again now i dont blame them i hate when a dvd is re released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor i however disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they dont want to purchase them again now they have the right to be angry but if you dont own them you should not review them let alone rate them the lowest score in short you already know how great these movies are if you do not already own them all then they make a great buy i purchased all three since i only owned the theatrical cut of the fellowship of the ring i was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again the box art is pretty freaking cool too and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me they dont take a lot of room which is good for me because i have soo many movies that the more space i can save the better the only thing you should know is that although both theatrical and extended cuts are on one disc you still have to switch the disc over in between the movie which is really not a big deal i highly recommend getting these to those that dont own them yet 
the lord of the rings trilogy is truly an epic project that surprisingly works in every regard the trilogy is a truly masterpiece ands easily the best films of the last decade tfotr ttt and trotk are great films that work on their own but they are much better if seen as a whole motion picture the story the characters the battles the effects the music the directiona and everything else has to be praised because it works perfect peter jackson created a truly amazing motion picture that will be timeless regardless which one is your favorite mine is the third all three are part of a spectacular story that will require multiple viewings to swallow all the nuances it has more praise is repetitive because all has been said about this trilogy and with enormous box office success and academy awards including one for best picture what else can i said that it hasnt been said the only thing is that after all this years this trilogy continues to hold up and never fails to leave me in complete awe aside from the theatrical editions peter jackson released the extended editions shortlyt after amazingly i never saw them until i bought this set and i have to say that this editions are truly the definitive editions of an outstanding trilogy all the included footage enhances the viewing experience in all three films and especially in trotk watching sarumans demise was a real treat many loose ends like the relationship between faramir ans eowyn are given more time and overall they lift the films in every way this ee bd trilogy is the definitive edition of tlotr video audio i never bought the theaticral set on bd but i read many reviews complaining about the picture quality of tfotr for this release warner remastered the movie but this was also surrounded by controversy because the color palette changed giving the film a green cast im happy to report that i didnt perceive any green cast and tfotr looks absolutely amazing in hd likewise ttt and trotk also are demo quality and something that you will want to show to your friends and relatives detail is very crisp darks are balanced no artifacts whatsoever and skin tones look vivid thus simply are amazing transfers another source of controversy was that the films are split on two discs im not the type of person who will cry about getting up in the middle of the movie and im glad that the films were split becuase that increases the quality and makes them look wonderful in the audio department the three films feature dts hd ma that its absolutely amazing its equal or even better than the video presentation bonus features each film comes with three dvds loaded of special features the first two dvds of each box are the appendices an amazing part documentary that delves with everything from the inception of the project to the release of the films very informative and interesting to watch this should not be missed the last three dvds of each boxset are dedicated to the costa botes documentaries that provides behind the scenes of each film also you have audiocommentaries on each film my only minor complaint is that warner should have put the material on bd so it would require fewer discs but aside from that everything is perfect online digital copies are also offered the box is wide and thick it has a beautiful golden color and inside you have three wide cases with discs each closing thoughts tlotr is truly a classic motion picture event and this release does the film justice with amazing transfers of the ee which are the superior ones a bombastic mix and a lot of hours of bonus material this set is a must own for everyone highly recommended 
the cinematic release pales in comparison to these extended editions which feature footage that helps tie up loose ends flesh out the characters make them more personable and charming and understandable frankly i sold my old copies of lord of the rings and never ever want to watch them again after viewing the extended editions which are a vast improvement no complaints whosoever decided to cut the scenes out of the theatrical release deserves a special kind of punishment maybe to be the next ring bearer hey hollywood if a movie is as awesome as lord of the rings we the audience will accept a hour length just give an intermission or two for bathroom breaks and the like i still cant get over the bean counters cutting scenes that were so relevant and meaningful from the original 
the movies are epic and the extended versions done up in beautiful full hd makes everything that much better i already owned the regular dvds but the upgrade was quite noticeable even with the upconvert
where is the green just watched the fellowship of the ring with my boys it was fantastic and no one noticed the big green monster some were talking about we all looked for green titles green snow any green where it shouldnt be none of us saw anything please dont let the green controversy stop you from buying the set 
the films look great in the hi def format and i think the one star reviews are ridiculous these movies are excellent and a great value i already have the extended versions on dvd so i wanted the theatrical versions for blu ray and these are perfect sometimes i want to watch the trilogy but i have no desire to sit through the extended versions so yes im one of those fans of both versions of the films a note to the one star reviewers please do not rate a product so low just because you didnt do your research before buying or because youre angry that the version you wanted wasnt released yet thats childish 
how many films can you say will still be watched years from now in years i can assure you this will be one of them peter jackson has exceeded himself to produce a bona fide historic achievement of truly epic proportions this is cinema at its absolute best everyone involved deserves limitless praise thanks 
j r r tolkiens lord of the rings trilogy was considered unfilmable for a very long time the story was too big too fantastical but in the late s new zealand director peter jackson got the green light to shoot the lord of the rings movie trilogy a frightening undertaking but jackson was up to the challenge the rest is film history with brilliant acting stunning direction and a powerful epic story the fellowship of the ring introduces us to the hobbits eccentric old bilbo baggins ian holm leaves the peaceful shire at his st birthday leaving all he has to his young nephew frodo elijah wood including a golden ring that makes the wearer invisible but the grey wizard gandalf ian mckellen reveals that its actually the one ring which is the source of power for the demonic dark lord sauron horrified frodo and his best pals leave the shire and join a band of elves men and dwarves to take the ring to the only place where it can be destroyed the two towers picks up immediately after fellowship ends frodo and sam sean astin are lost on the path to mordor worse theyre being stalked by gollum andy serkis who owned the ring for centuries and is enslaved to it but because he knows safe ways into mordor frodo lets gollum come along elsewhere aragorn viggo mortensen legolas orlando bloom and gimli john rhys davies make a desperate stand against the orc armies with the kingdom of rohan return of the king brings the trilogy to a head frodo and sams friendship is threatened by gollums trickery and frodo is led into a deadly trap elsewhere gandalf rides with pippin billy boyd to gondor the kingdom that aragorn is heir to aragorn summons an army of ghosts and attacks the heart of mordor as frodo and sam arrive at the volcanic mount doom where the ring was forged but can frodo bring himself to destroy the ring a lot of people were nervous when first hearing that lord of the rings was being translated onto the big screen there were just too many things goofy scripting bad special effects mutilated characters that could go wrong in fact it had already been wrecked in a few prior attempts those fears turned out to be pretty much unfounded some characters are different from what they are in the book faramir and arwen for example are altered and added to and a handful are gone altogether but as both an adaptation and a cinematic experience this is a winner jackson and co outdid themselves with nearly every aspect of the films the scripting is impeccable a good balance of dark and light humor and horror the sets and new zealand landscapes are breathtaking as the cameras pan over snowy plains and mountaintops and the special effects are almost entirely convincing looking especially the gruesome gollum hes the first fully convincing cgi character and after awhile youll forget he is made digitally elijah wood is outstanding as frodo baggins he runs the emotional gamut fear pain horror happiness resignation rage love lust and emptiness sean astin is equally good as the steadfast sam who grows from frodos timid pal to a strong hearted warrior supporting hobbits dominic monaghan and billy boyd get to grow up into mature young men but as lovable as the hobbits are they do not dominate all of the screen ian mckellen is excellent as the grandfatherly wizard gandalf viggo mortensen christopher lee hugo weaving liv tyler john rhys davies orlando bloom and sean bean are only part of the amazing supporting cast all of whom give excellent performances for some inexplicably reason new line has chosen to release only the theatrical versions of this movie in blu ray in rather than the extended or both editions its not like they wouldnt fit reportedly peter jackson is saving the extended blu ray editions for an ultimate edition box set near the hobbit release which means another couple years wait the movie adaptation of the lord of the rings trilogy has been accepted by most fans and critics alike why because the trilogy is among the best movies ever put to film a stunning achievement 
if you wait until its too late do it now and at least give us a chance to experience it before the dang world ends sheeesh cut us a break 
so much has been removed from the theatrical version this blu ray extended version really brings to life the epic story of j r r tolkiens masterpiece this movie trilogy is the greatest adaption of any book series the characters are more fleshed out there is more story development in the extended edition and of course the graphics and special effects are amazing even after almost a decade george lucas must weep with shame at seeing how a movie trilogy based on fantasy should look this is great storytelling period 
there are many movies that people talk about when they talk about things such as the best movies of all time such examples would be casablanca the star wars or perhaps indiana jones trilogy the lord of the rings trilogy is another example this trilogy is a masterful work of cinema art in case anyone hasnt seen these yet i will offer a brief spoiler free summary of each the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring starts off be explaining some of the history of middle earth specifically that of the legendary one ring forged by the dark lord sauron the ring changes hands over the eons and is eventually lost and by chance a hobbit named bilbo baggins finds it sixty years later bilbo is still alive and well and looking quite young despite his one hundred and eleven years after some interesting events at his birthday party the one ring is handed down to frodo bilbos nephew the wise wizard gandalf tells frodo that he must leave his home at once lest he be killed by the horrorifying ringwraiths the nazgul the rest of the movie has to do with how a fellowship is formed to assist frodo in taking the one ring to mt doom a powerful volcano and the one place where the ring can be destroyed the second movie the two towers starts off right where fotr finished frodo and his friend sam are wandering around in a rocky wasteland getting ever closer to mordor and mt doom they meet up with the strange creature gollum who craves to have the one ring however he agrees to help them get to mt doom meanwhile the other members of the fellowship get involved with saving the people of rohan from a massive army of evil the third and final movie the return of the king starts off with a disturbing summary of gollums history then it continues with sam and frodos getting ever closer to mt doom apparently gollum may have a not so hidden agenda the others are busy trying to save the city of men minas tirith from a jaw droppingly massive army those summaries arent that great i know but theyll give you an overall feel for the story moving on the dvds themselves are pretty good each comes in the standard little case each containing two dvds the first dvd contains the theatrical release of the movie in widescreen and a number of various options different languages subtitles etc the second contains a variety of featurettes explaining certain special effects interviews with the actors and so on each dvd also contains a small folded paper booklet that gives listings of the scenes you can select with pictures so you can quickly skip to your favorite parts overall this is a great collection if you really liked the movies you might want to go with the collectors editions which have a lot of added scenes and many more special features and extras 
wow just wow i hadnt watched these movies in what had been at least years in fact i had not seen the extended editions at all i purchased this set over star wars for one simple reason george lucas is getting ridiculous with his retouching of the original trilogy i do not regret my decision one bit the story of frodo and the fellowship is one that will remain timeless for generations to come our children and our childrens children will revisit this trilogy and i can guarantee that the majority of them will be just as amazed as we are this blu ray set is definitive every single movie is more than hours long but the movies are so entertaining that the long run time is not an issue the special features are amazing and the hd transfer is probably one of the best available right now all in all this set is worth owning for fans of the series and new comers alike 
personally i think these movies were adapted as well as humanly possible from the books and stay true to the intent of the author the tale is classic the acting well done and the sets and effects superb i highly recommend the extended edition over the regular edition if you have the attention span the extra character depth provided as well as the extra action sequences are well worth the extra hour or so per movie also the special features including behind the scenes documentaries and interviews with cast and crew are top quality and often very entertaining if you have the time and are looking for even more watch the movies with the commentaries on i mainly enjoyed the actors one for amusing stories and snarky comments overall a beautiful fantasy story and a clear tale of good vs evil everyone should watch it at least once 
the regular lotr movies are wonderful but the extended editions are a must buy for fans they give you an in depth look at how the films were made and the story behind the movies the commentaries are funny and those alone are worth buying the trilogy 
if when you went to the movie theatre to see the lord of the rings trilogy you cried for more this extended special edition is for you not only because the battle secuensces are a litle bit more extended not only because howard shore recorded more music for this edition not only becuase includes more special efects secuenses its just the fact that it shows you details that help you to get more sense from the story making it more deep and remarkable peter jacksons love for the story and the vision that he wanted from the beginig for the movies are reflected in this extended trilogy way beyond my expectations this is the best version ever this is the must have 
it appears viewers either would lie down in front of a train for this series or throw it off the train in going over the reviews the low star reviewers spew venom about everything from the acting to the dialog and at least get the characters right i believe a golem is some evil thing in jewish mythology the proper name here is gollum and i have to believe that these people were not the ones who smuggled flashlights so they could read the books under the covers after they were sent to bed if you didnt absorb the story as part of your youth you really have no business throwing stones at it now most of the time a work of this magnitude does not transpose well to film peter jackson has done a herculean task here and the new zealand landscape certainly helped his cause i tried once to work through joseph campbells book on mythology from which tolkien took a good amount of material and some day when i dont have so much else on my mind ill try again until then i will reread the trilogy every couple of years and refer to the silmarillion on finer points of history and then sit down and enjoy the jackson movies i dont even watch them in any particular order theyre all good for different frames of mind there are liberties taken with the storyline and some parts of the book are left out completely i especially missed ghan buri ghan and his tribe of mountain dwellers but in a work of such scope its unavoidable the casting was clearly brilliant i cannot think of a more aragorn like aragorn than viggo mortensen ditto for legolas orlando bloom although poor christopher lee must get tired over an entire career of playing bad guys i never tire of watching this series and consider it an apt and wonderful adaptation to film better than i expected 
now my assumption i have of my audience is that everyone likes the movies but is wondering is the blu ray worth buying if i have the other movies on dvd i say yes the blu ray is stunning and if were going to question the movies i must point out theyre awesome and i pity all who dont enjoy fantasy with the blu ray from the fires of mordor to the cool running water in rivendell all is crystal clear i reccomend it fully and personally i think you should wait for a sale like when i bought it but remember this is a disc set including parts one and two of all three movies and bonus features for anyone who questions if they should buy the movies for children i believe anyone under shouldnt watch these movies gollum is kind of creepy and the bloodshed is much but there is no cursing which is a plus overall i highly reccomend buying this combo pack 
this is a great blu ray set it was worth it to get the set the picture looks amazing if you are a lord of the rings fan then check this out i love these movies when i was a kid and still love them just as much as an adult great trilogy 
beautiful picture quality great sound and it is a leap in quality over the dvds it is also nice to have the digital copies well worth the wait 
what the majority are saying is true this has to be the best blu ray i have seen to date even on my cheap bedroom tv the sound is crystal clear and the picture blows you away my vizio with surround sound is better than theater quality kudos to whoever developed these copies 
peter jackson will perhaps never match the achievement of his lotr trilogy it is a truly epic tale of good vs evil and personal sacrifice the care he lavishes on the series treats it lovingly the casting is superb as are the realistic cg effects the extended versions are much fuller in content and meaning than the theatrical releases dont try to decide between the sets get this one ok you know i love it so let me tell you some things i feel were glaringly omitted tom bombadil and his wife goldberry tom is one of the most intriguing characters in the literary work so much so that the council at rivendell consider giving him the one ring to guard and care for their reasoning that he could never be mastered by sauron a claim which no other being could make even gandalf at one point he even puts the ring on his finger with no effect to him it is a trinket in the literary work frodo grows in stature and wisdom beyond saruman sarumans death is a result of their confrontation in the shire which has not escaped the groaning of the rest of middle earth under the torment of saurons evil the returned hobbits then lead their fellow citizens in scouring the shire of the southren men that have overrun it and are forever revered as mighty military generals sams special gift from galadriel is then used to restore the shire these things do not detract from my overall enjoyment and reverence for this monumental cinematic work 
these are very powerfully absorbing films the extended scenes lend to the texture and depth of the overall narrative these extensions are very much welcome visually each film is stunning and combined with the moving and haunting sounds immerse the viewer into seemingly richly textured and multifaceted landscapes of the fantastic vision of their world absolutely captivating in every sense 
since i prefer the theatrical versions instead of the extended cuts i bought this and im very glad i did here is some info about this bluray edition packaging the nine discs that make up this set come housed in a beautiful embossed slipcase the cover art is holographic so the ring design shimmers and flashes brilliant colors as the light changes sometimes it is a firey red sometimes emerald green royal blue golden yellow or deep purple it also produces a multi color effect it is quite striking and a very attractive design the discs are housed inside the slipcase in two bluray keepcases these cases have the same design as the slipcase although they do not produce the holographic effect the first case is thicker than standard and holds the three feature films on bluray and the three discs of supplemental materials the discs are securly held in place in the flip type holders and the holders have slots for a thumb or finger to help release the disc after the center hub is pressed the art work on the discs is identical to the artwork used for the initial dvd release of the films although the bluray logo has been added to the feature films the second case contains the three digital copies of the feature films and is in a standard size keepcase artwork on these discs is almost solid black with an indistinct design barely visible functionality this may be one of my favorite aspects of this edition loading time on these discs is lightening fast i was watching the film within seconds of inserting the disc in the player after a second fbi warning screen the menu pops up and you are ready to go unless you want to change an audio option or turn on subtitles audio options are only english and spanish there are no commercials no forced trailers and no advertisements telling you how wonderful bluray is thank you warner bros new line the bluray discs are bonusview enabled and the pop up menu is discrete and easy to navigate main menus feature music from the film and a simple and elegant design the discs are also bd live capable and will take you to the wb bd live site picture quality what can i say other than the picture quality is spectacular i had read several advance reviewsof this release and didnt really know what to expect since the reviewers opinions went from epic fail to stunning so im glad i found them to be breathtaking and gorgeous transfers color is vibrant the shire has never been more vivid and beautiful and detail is for the most part quite sharp and crisp fabrics stand out very well and leaves of trees patches of moss designs on weapens etc are remarkably clear black levels are spot on throughout very deep and shadow detail is excellent i did notice a couple instances of noise a few times but these amounted to less than seconds total so i dont think that is bad for a hour plus film i also noticed a strobe effect once or twice but it lasted only for a few seconds some viewers may find the color to be too saturated and may want to adjust their settings accordingly the colors and contrast are really jacked up on this but i found it to be to my liking although the picture isnt entirely perfect it comes pretty close audio quality the dts hd master audio soundtrack is perfect i dont see how anyone could complain about this its flawless dialog is clear music is balanced and sound effects are spectacular this is a truly immersive experience your rear speakers will stay busy during the entire film and your subwoofer will get quite a work out i felt a strong breeze coming from my subwoofer from across the room many times and it was literally shaking the windows and i was only listening at about a third of the volume possible i dont know what more anyone could ask for from a surround sound experience it is among the very best ive heard for a home theatre bonus materials the new bonus material consists of high definition trailers for the films including a lengthy super trailer and two lotr games trailers also in hd these features are presented on the bluray discs the standard definition discs of supplemental material are identical in every way to the bonus discs that came with the original theatrical edition dvd release so if you own those versions you already have this stuff nothing new whatsoever im very glad it is included in this set as now i can give away my dvd edition and still have the documentary stuff etc there is over hours of behind the scenes interviews music videos etc included in these discs and they gave me more information than i needed about the making of these films booklet inserts there are several inserts included in this set and they are housed in the digital copy case the helpful one is a six page fold out booklet that has small color photos from the film and includes discriptions of the contents of each of the bluray discs and the three bonus materials discs as well as a short synopsis of each film there is an insert for the lotr bud k catalog trying to sell you knives and swords an insert for the aragorns quest video game a off discount coupon for selected lotr merchandise and an instruction sheet on how to use the digital copies final thoughts if you love the original versions of lotr then you will want this edition if you only want the ee then skip it if you are concerned about poor reviews concerning the quality of the transfer i dont know what to tell you i thought they were excellent peter jackson approved the transfers for this bluray edition you can watch him discuss it in an interview that is easy to find on youtube and said he thought they looked fantastic i think so too i watched these films on a sharp aquas inch lcd with a philips watt home theatre system and thought they looked and sounded incredible perhaps dnr and other enhancement issues some pro reviewers have pointed out are only apparent on larger projection systems they looked good to me i consider this set to be a good value at the price almost all retailers are selling it for which is in line with what three individual bluray discs would cost the msrp is too much as is always the case with bluray discs but im unaware of any retailer selling it for that price as far as im concerned this is the last edition of lotr i will have to buy at least until the next look how perfect and much better this is new format comes along this one really is a big step up in quality from the dvd release while i watched the extendeds once i think the films are much better in these versions so i guess im one of the few at least on amazon who is really happy with this release 
i have been waiting for years for this jagoff peter jackson for extracting as much money as possible by releasing this collections without the extended edition angered me but im happy now disregard anyone and everyone giving this anything short of a start review and trust in me when i say this is absolutely flawless and perfect for those saying the picture quality is questionable phooey get a better tv i have a samsung series lcd which is top of the line for lcds along with their series and an onkyo receiver with focal sib cub pristine speaker system the sound and picture are unbeatable period nothing more to say 
i have a sony bvd e blu ray player and i requested an rma for the first set of discs i got in the mail when i tried to play disc two of fotr after requesting the rma i read some reviews to see if the issue was widespread one review mentioned that there was a memory tag that needed to be saved from the first disc to allow you to play the second disc sounded like a terrible design but i tried and failed to get it to work finally after failing to be able to get the second disc to play for any of the movies i dug into the sony support website and there happened to be a thread concerning this issue pressing the ok or select the round button with cross hairs on the sony remote button after the movie goes to pause and second on the timer will start the movie playing i tried using usb memory in the usb port and changing the settings i tried to set it to usb and remove the memory as some suggested but still no luck so pressing the ok button worked for me hope this helps someone as far as the movies go i dont notice any green tint on my mitsubishi wd i did feel the scenes in moria were pretty dark and had to turn the brightness up a bit gandalfs beard was almost black when they were up on the mountain in the snow maybe that was intentional jacob
this bluray collection is everything i expected all the movies in beautiful high definition if you are a fan of lotr i highly recommend this set 
come on now new line stop doing this to us with blu ray you can put both theatrical and extended cuts on one blu each with space to spare and have a disc or two of suppilments as well thats the way it should be done give me a vote if you agree i guess new line knows that its lotr so it can release these multiple times on blu and fans will buy the stars is for the films themselves not what new line is doing to the fans give us lotr blu ray fans what we deserve true fans cherish both versions after all peter jacksons king kong from had both theatical extended versions on its blu ray from universal they did it right even though the extras could have been better i as fan was happy as we plainly see this is new lines biggest cash cow mooooo and there gonna keep on milking it 
without getting into a debate over the sheer number of versions and box sets lord of the rings has gone through over the past years i think it is quite clear which two box sets are the ones to rule them all for dvd users platinum extended edition boxset or individual sets for blu ray extended edition trilogy set both packs offer incredible value for what you get anyhow onto the review for the blu ray extended edition boxset this is the blu ray set i have been waiting for since the format became the hd standard the production value put into this boxset is magnificent and brings so much lord of the rings to the table you might as well just have gotten transported to middle earth instead of all these disks this boxset has it all what we have here is essentially a re boxing of the platinum series dvd set with all movies remastered in blu ray high definition boxset packaging the extended edition blu ray trilogy comes in a special trilogy box which almost looks like book in my opinion it opens with a flap that is held in place by magnets that rest under the artwork which makes the boxset not only aesthetically pleasing but uses a very simple and effective mechanism to open and close inside you will find all movies in special edition black blu ray cases this was a shock to me as normally blu ray movies come in blue cases the black w antique bronze coloring really makes the case and movie cases stick out in terms of a boxset case this is probably the nicest case i have besides my ultimate seinfeld dvd collection what do you get inside you will find all movies each movie contains blu ray re mastering of the movie on disks both disks contain commentary tracks dvds containing the appendices which essentially give you everything from make up design interviews costume design to artwork and concept slides dvd for a behind the scenes look at the movie in all you get blu ray disks dvds appendices behind the scenes this is a mind blowing amount of stuff in this boxset it comes to nearly hours of extras without including the movies despite all the content please be aware the dvds contained in the blu ray extended edition boxset are identical to the ones included with the dvd platinum series set the only added feature is the costa botes documentary was missing on the platinum set movie quality br vs dvd br vs hdtv these movies look outstanding words cant describe it actually i actually own the original dvd boxset theatrical using my playstation for equal comparison the dvds upscaled to p vs blu ray movies p hz blu ray hands down not even a contest the big comparison now is p hdtv showing vs blu ray i just so happen to dvr fellowship of the ring on my dvr in i and did a comparison the blu ray is still better it is a much closer battle but the blu ray editions look crisper and have superior color each movie looks stunning on blu ray the mastering that went into this edition shows and it also shows why the blu ray version is on disks despite each disk holding gb a piece vs an gb dvd there is virtually no negatives to speak of well the only negative i really could mention is the extras all being on dvd a re boxing of the existing content saves money but people are also paying a premium for blu ray if you remastered the movie why not remaster all the bonus content too just my opinion though audio options each movie is mastered in dts hd master audio and comes with a variety of sound options the disks i received have the following language options movie audio english or portugues subtitles english spanish or portuguesthe subtitles in english are big and crisp w o taking up to much of the movie perfect for someone who has a hard time seeing small writing overall the lord of the rings extended edition blu ray trilogy pack is amazing stars without a doubt if you have been holding off for ages to get these films on disk then this is the set you should get p mastering every special feature you could imagine a beautiful yet simple packaging to keep the movies safe this truly is one boxset to rule them all note see comments for a basic faq about the disks example will this run on my ps why are the movies on disks etc 
this review is for the blu ray extended edition of lotr get it get it get it i could stop there but ill flesh out this recommendation a bit first there seems to be some debate between getting the blu ray edition or the dvd edition in terms of the quality of picture if you have a good blu ray player that upscales dvds well the picture image is pretty comparable unfortunately not all b r players are created equal and some dont upscale as well as others if you can relate to this the desirability of my players upscaling capabilities rate right up there with rat phlegm then you should definitely consider getting the b r edition rather than settling for poorly upscaled dvds my player however does a great job at upscaling and with that in mind i have to give a slight nod to the b r disks its close but b r edges out dvd by a rats whisker man this guys obsessed with rats one could argue the difference is all in my mind but i see the b r edition picture as slightly cleaner and more vibrant than the upscaled dvd the great news is if a huge price difference existed between b r and dvd editions i would have to lean towards sparing the almighty dollar and going with a wildly less expensive dvd version but the prices are so comparable now for b r for dvd that unless you really dont have extra bucks to spare i strongly suggest you invest in the b r edition in my opinion the modest improvement between b r and good upscaled dvds is worth the few extra dollars regarding the issue with greenish hue and overall darkness of picture quality particularly on the two towers disks when i made my purchase amazon had a note on the product page saying it was temporarily suspending its own sales of the b r set due to complaints about these issues i purchased from a rd party seller and im esctatic to report that the images on all b r disks are pristine and just as they should be it looks like amazon simply had a defective stock of product i notice their disclaimer message has been removed presumably this means they replaced the faulty stock with good product so i would not hesitate to order through amazon on that account if youre still leery of the amazon connection and think they may have moved your cheese is he about to start talking about rats again the rd party seller i purchased through was super fast dvds roger j farney fulfillment was done by amazon so prime still applied it was about more for the b r package but i considered that well worth it to avoid amazons then bad batch problems i can verify from my experience that farneys stock of product had no technical glitches he has a lifetime rating of satisfaction and more recently has been hitting in the to range you really cant go wrong there if youre at all still concerned about the problems amazon had probably other sellers have good product as well but i chose farney based on his satisfaction ratings and on the fact that i got the prime free day shipping this saved me a couple of bucks and largely offset the extra he charges for the b r edition over amazons price as for the extended scenes what can i say they are magnificent the theatrical release was excellent and remained very true to tolkiens original work the extended material while sometimes deviating from a strictly literal recitation of the novels nevertheless remains true not only to the spirit of tolkiens vision but is internally consistent with the rest of the movies the added material helps the story flow better than ever it makes an already enjoyable movie experience even more enjoyable get this blu ray edition grab your main squeeze park it on the sofa with popcorn and some drinks and prepare for a truly magical experience may the force be with you oooops sorry wrong movie 
even without the extra materials appendages the special extended versions are more than worth the price sure there are some who whine and moan about this scene or that but peter jackson cast crew did an excellent job that i doubt anybody else could duplicate especially the armchair quarterback whiners and moaners in short beg borrow steal or cash in your food stamps to get the extra few bucks you need to get the special extended versions its well worth it 
i purchased this as the deal of the day and its worth every penny i paid for it hopefully this will be the last time any of us have to rebuy essentially the same thing 
and so it has finally arrived one of the main reasons to invest in a blu ray player while its true that lord of the rings has been on blu ray for some time now the shorter theatrical release of this trilogy is not in my opinion the real version of lord of the rings as the extra footage adds important texture and some missing plot points not found in the theatrical release with the dvd versions of the extended edition out of print this is pretty much the only choice for anyone wanting to experience the truest version of lotr and for what its worth its also the best if in my opinion still more expensive than it should be at some of the brick and mortar stores choice between the versions of the extended edition given the upgrade to high definition by way of background lord of the rings was considered by many to be an unfilmable adaptation for many years given both the scope of the storys various threads and the technology that would be needed to bring middle earth to life without looking hokey or cheap indeed lord of the rings was probably one of the most ambitious projects i can think of requiring the filming of movies simultaneously and gambling on a high fantasy genre that fell out of favor during the s when gritty post modern sensibilities held sway in movie culture lord of the rings managed to bring middle earth to life by in part flavoring its mind bogglingly immersive world of magic and monsters with a stark sense of realism and brutality equally as impressive is how director peter jackson and his production team did their best to walk the line between making commercially viable movies without conceding too much to hollywood sensibilities one can reasonably debate and disagree with the small decisions and minutia on characterization choices individual plot tweaks and other variances from the source material and i have my own small issues with the movies but lets face it many of the compromises pale in the face of the overall accomplishment here each of the movies is spread across blu ray discs which granted is a pain to have to swap but the flip side is that you get maximum visual and audio fidelity while retaining the multiple commentary tracks which include cast crew and the director writers unfortunately the copious amounts of extras are still on dvd for each of the movies but in the end they arent so important that the obligatory price increase for blu ray extras would be worth it there has also been a lot of talk about the alleged green tint issue for the fellowship of the ring in this set i will admit that i dont have the theatrical blu ray of that movie so im not sure if the first go round of hi definition mastering had lessened any green tint from the dvds however im almost dead certain that the color choices are fairly similar to the dvd version of the extended version which had some rather intense blues and greens dominating some scenes and no this doesnt look like someone threw the movie into a matrix green visual processor while it is apparent that there was a little bit of tinkering with the overall color at points it is in no way deleterious to the movie in terms of overall extras youll find all the ones from the prior release of the extended version here which provide a lot of detail in terms of background art design and the making of the trilogy and all the multiple commentaries as well which is one reason why each movie is on discs theres also a bd live option but as i never connect to the internet when watching blu rays im not qualified to speak on that feature lets examine each of the individual movies fellowship of the ring this was where it all started and may be in some ways the strongest of the trilogy of the movies it hews closest to the heroic quest structure and it also is the most grounded and personal with less reliance on cgi loaded battle scenes the central conflict is established here and the majority of the important characters are introduced as well it should be noted that the battle in balins tomb was the point where i realized that if a fantasy world were ever to actually exist this is how it would play out in reality uncompromising brutal and fast paced on the flipside i felt that the temptation of galadriel scene was far too unsubtle and stuck out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the movie in terms of visual quality as fellowship had to be remastered from the source prints it is a little less sharp than the other movies although still great looking which on the other hand does make it look more organic the extended editions new material does a good job of adding further texture and background such as references to events from the silmarillon and expounding on the impending departure of the elves for the west as is the case in all the movies there are some fine performances here including sean beans portrayal of boromir hugo weavings elrond christopher lee as saruman and ian mckellan in the role he may well have been born to play gandalf the two towers visually the two towers does up the ante and is notably less saturated in terms of color schemes than fellowship as a movie towers is problematic in that it doesnt have the same traditional momentum as its predecessor the viewer jumps straight into an ongoing story and the movie introduces some more major characters gollum faramir and theoden and his kin while the main characters we already know are split up into different groups with narratives going at the same time also by having the battle of helms deep dominate the second half of the movie in contrast to pippin and merry essentially being stuck hanging out in a forest some fatigue does set in that being said the sweeping conclusion of the battle of helms deep defines the term wagnerian moment while the introduction of the people of rohan manages to add to the depth of the movies even if the exorcism of theoden scene subverts the subtlety of the books approach it should be noted also that this movie tinkers with the books plot more so than its predecessor although to be fair aragorns momentary removal from the action is used to segue into a sequence that incorporates the eventual fate of aragorn and arwen as told in the appendices the extended editions new material actually outdoes fellowship in terms of helping the movies stay closer to the spirit of the books especially in terms of doing faramirs character justice and adding thematic grace notes from the book that were missing from the theatrical version the return of the king the final movie is also the hardest to judge in many ways visually it is the most impressive with epic vistas and truly surreal lighting and effects shots scenes such as gandalf and pippins ride into gondor the march of saurons army from the gates of minas morgul sam and frodos journey into mordor and the charge of the rohirrim on the pellenor fields are all wonderfully rendered to the extent that they look they were ripped straight of the imagination at the same time however the high definition rendering makes the computer generated aspects of the effects shots stick out more in comparison to the live action participants or backdrops similarly while most of the movie is incredible stuff there are sour notes here and there that only serve to contrast with the high quality of the rest of rotk denethors portrayal seemed far too over the top while the use of slow motion which was effective in fellowship has by this point in the trilogy simply become overdone on the other hand sean astins performance as sam manages to steal the show while bernard hills world worn portrayal of king theoden similarly stands out the additional material in the extended edition once again manages to add needed depth and actually wraps up an important story thread saruman that the theatrical version neglected to do so unfortunately the scouring of the shire does not show up here as it was never filmed but then again considering this version of rotk already runs around hours long it wouldnt be feasible for the flow of the movie in any case despite the very high quality of this trilogy its not for everyone as compared to the star wars saga its most obvious peer the movies tend to move at a more deliberate less breezy pace and given the length of each of the movies it can try the patience a bit in addition there will always be a contingent that will tend to dislike movies that are heavy on special effects especially if its an adaptation of their favorite books and of course some people just plain dont like fantasy movies but overall this is one of those franchises that reinvigorated my love for movies while it may have unleashed a wave of so so movies over the past decade that relied too heavily on special effects e g the clash of the titans remake there will always be lesser followers in the wake of those with ambition in my opinion an absolutely essential set to have 
i had the full set of extended edition dvds but the upgrade to blu ray if you have a good size quality hdtv and sound system is well worth it 
i know that after buying the theatrical releases on dvd i was not happy about having buy them again at a higher price i resisted buying them for long time until i saw the extended fellowship and two towers on starz i had to admit that these versions made the originals obsolete you cannot see them again without missing the added content as they never showed the extended return i had buy this set to see it for the first time all three films are transformed into a new viewing experience both in story content and picture sound quality i noticed in addition to the full scenes that were added the action and fighting sequences were more complete and detailed it is quite a difference from the theatrical versions the full scenes are not filler or obvious cuts like in other films but are essential parts of the overall story that were cut because of time constraints this is a must have for anyone loves the books and the movies i guarantee you wont watch your old versions ever again 
time and time again i have tried to sit down in front of my computer screen and write a review for this movie time and time again ive found myself sitting for hours staring blankly at the page before me trying to find the words to tell you how i feel about this movie to tell you how this movie changed my life and helped shape me into the person i am today the words never come because i never had them to begin with ive never been able to explain just what it is about this movie that touched me all those years ago in the front row of a crowded movie theater so i wont even try i wont try to explain the beauty and awe this film evokes from its viewers or the sense of peace one feels when watching it i wont talk about how the script is one of the most brilliant scripts ever written for a motion picture and i wont try to explain how lovely the musical score is all i will say is that this movie and the books it was based on changed my life in a very profound way it made me interested in reading which in turn planted the seed for my passion for writing it inspired me to create to learn to expand my view of the world to many this is just a movie nine hours of entertainment just like any other movie but to me its the panicle of success for film making one that puts to shame trilogies like the matrix or star wars and that laughs at classics like citizen kane and seven samaria this to make it shot is simply the best film ever made in the history of mankind 
warner new line take note i will only purchase lotr on blu ray if its the extended editions not your shameless slap in the face to the fans with the current theatrical only release 
this may be bold to say but i personally feel that the lord of the rings trilogy serves as the best movie series of all time not everyone will share my view but theres many out there who will and for good reason the movies give superb acting a wonderful score breath taking visual effects and an excellent story thats complex fun and inspiring while the theatrical movies give scope this collection adds to what is already a great movie experience the deleted scenes present more to the story than what was already given showing places characters and scenes to richly explore the tale of the one ring and the lands of middle earth the story does grow in length reaching from about hours for theatrical to roughly hours of this extended edition but it is well worth the thrill ride the bonus material is also great giving further enhancement to the collection by showing you how the movies were developed and produced while it may be a bit pricey the packaging is excellent giving each movie its own fold out case to put in an overall cover reminds you of a trilogy of books on the shelf very well packaged and enjoyable to have if you are as much a lord of the rings obsessive fan as i am this extended trilogy is a must have otherwise i would still try to obtain it if you like excellent movies that give you an unforgetable experience 
i bought the trilogy because i wanted to get the extended versions i am tremendously satisfied with the three films the quality on the three films is excellent i cant get enough of watching these movies i waited a while for the blu ray trilogy to be on sale and once it was i grabbed it anyone who has the trilogy in dvd format and is considering buying the blu ray format should do it if they can find it on sale overall i would recommend this epic trilogy 
the lord of the rings trilogy are some of the best movies ever made i have owned the theatrical dvds and recently bought the theatrical blu rays on sale during black friday i was browsing on amazon and saw that the extended cuts of the lotr series was available on blu ray i had to purchase it because i have heard so much about how great the extended cuts were and i havent had the chance to see them yet so far i havent watched the films but the packaging of this box set makes it worth the amazing price of alone the box is beautifully done showing a map of middle earth which is interesting to look at tracking the progress of the characters in the films there are plenty of special features which one day i will get around to watching at this is an amazing deal and only amazon would be the place for which i would buy this great set buy this one today 
lotr extended edition is a must have in hd format new line should be ashamed for this blantant attempt at fan exploitation it may end up burning them though they should be clamoring to release quality content like this on blu ray asap in order to grow their user base new line claims to be delaying the blu ray lotr extended edition release until at least summer and if the hobbit is delayed it may get pushed back until i am going to buy the lotr extended edition in the best hd format available whenever it is finally released its entirely possible that years from now blu ray will no longer the best hd format out there there may be something new and better by then only time will tell 
lord of the rings is a work of genius from start to finish the story is about a dark lord named sauron who made a deadly ring one that would wipe out all of humanity he was destroyed but his spirit still lives through the ring soon gandalf the wizard comes to visit the small town of hobbiton where he discovers his friend bilbo possesses the very ring that belonged to sauron soon gandalf passes the ring to frodo who is sent on a savage quest to destroy it he is helped laong the way by a courageous fellowship of warriors but soon the fellowship is divided by battle and the groups go their seperate ways the film continues with raging battles hard struggles and unbeatble evil finally the film ends with frodo destroying the ring and the others busy fighting saurons forces outside the gate of the dark land its a really fun movie 
great product and remember it is the extended version which every fan should get it comes in a great looking box that opens up to a map of middle earth and some other pictures inside are three separate blu ray cases for each movie which is a great addition to top of the cover the top lining that says blu ray is only on the wrapping and is discarded after the wrapping is taken off which might bother those with a similar looking dvd box 
this collection is probably the best dvd collection i have because you can tell the director put a lot of time money and energy into this collection director peter jackson shows hollywood how to make the ultimate extended collection there is no need to talk about the movies because it will take hours to write a review however all three movies are awesome if you enjoy movies that combine fantasy historical wars and religious beliefs then you will love these movies the dvd contains almost three extra hours of film footage added to the original theatrical films in dept documentaries behind the scene footages interviews with the cast and crew interactive maps photos storyboards special effects and so much more there are total discs in this collection and each dvd is used to the fullest my favorite part about this collection is the commentaries i especially enjoyed dominic monaghan and billy boyd they both had me laughing but i found sean astin very annoying he did not like others talking over him but he felt he could talk over others john noble has one of the sexiest voices i have ever heard i appreciate peter jackson and the writers filling in the blanks on different scenes the only complaint i have is you also have to purchase the regular version of this collection if you want all the lotr bonus materials there are some things the regular version has that the special version of the lotr do not have and vice versa nevertheless this is clearly the best version buy this movie it is the wizard of oz of our time 
these extended movies are significantly better than the original releases however i have found one problem they play fine on a dvd player but when i try to play them on a computer running vista and power dvd i get something like a subtitle that runs at the top of the movie and lists all the credits while the movie is playing this goes on the entire movie this seems to be somehow connected to the normal subtitles because if i turn the regular subtitles on these credits disappear if you are planning to watch these movies on a computer this is something to be aware of as it is incredibly distracting and basically makes the movies unwatchable 
i have this boxed set in the dvd version but got this collection on a sale price for blu ray that was too good to pass up upgraded at a fraction of the cost i paid for dvd as stated in prior reviews only the actual movie discs are blu ray all other bonus extra features are dvd did not have any sound issues with return of the king as previously stated by other customers maybe i got lucky very satisfied with this purchase 
this was my st blue ray purchase i was amazed by the clearity of the film i also was amazed the amount of work involved in making it also i learned so much about the author the lord of the rings the motion picture trilogy the fellowship of the ring the two towers the return of the king extended editions digital copy blu ray 
if lord of the rings is going to be released in blu ray it would be absurd and idiotic to release the theatrical version no one in his right mind would buy the theatrical version we need the extended versions please 
all the reviews on here of people complaining about the different versions of the lotr box set are hilarious everyone claims they are screwing us by releasing the theatrical versions first and the extended editions afterwards if you do not want the theatrical version box set then dont buy it but believe it or not some people actually want the theatrical versions but everyone complaining would have us believe that we all only want the extended versions this is why they created both versions clearly not every lotr fan wants the exact same thing this is similar to the star wars trilogy debate the old school fans want the original star wars blu ray dvd sets the way they originally showed in theaters yet they only provide the remastered editions that lucas created in the s my point is that every fan is different and each want something different so for someone who wants the theatrical version lotr set on blu ray this set is clearly a star if you want the extended edition lotr set go buy that one instead and leave your review there 
over at the one ring dot net they posted that warner bros will be making an announcement regarding both versions comic con coming up pretty soon seems to be the logical place to make that move maybe just maybe all this posting of the almost unanimous fuming of fans has finally reached the ears of the higher ups and made a difference i still wouldnt hold my breath just yet but who knows this could be some really good news at last lets hope so anyway 
great movie top to bottom i highly recommend it if you have not seen it yet the bluray extended edition has great behind the scenes material as well including commentaries by many people involved in the film peter jackson elijah wood viggo mortonson etc 
anyone who likes the lord of the rings films and only has the theatrical versions and doesnt have any of the seperate extended versions buy this peter jackson has created something so close to the lord of the rings books that him and the three films he made were well deservant of the total oscar nominations and total wins the trilogy got fellowship of the ring nominations wins two towers nominations wins return of the king nominations wins inculding best picture and to the people who dont like the lord of the rings you can dislike the lord of the rings but all of you will never understand how incredibly huge the three films really were and they are way beyond all peoples imgainations even mine the three films were made at the same time peter jackson is not a joke and the lord of the rings was certainly a staggering achivement and to all the people who think not that would have happened when whales started walking on earth 
if you really like lord of the rings then you will love the extended editions they arent like directors cuts that you see in so many movies that you watch and then think to yourself wow i can see why they cut that the scenes are well polished and do nothing but add to the film many of the things are just added time during contemplative or dramatic moments that greatly add feeling or tension after watching these i feel like many of these cuts were made with tears in eyes knowing that the film had to be shorter to accommodate a wider audience but for more patient and involved fans the extended versions are marvelous 
if you havent heard these films in their dts es mixes yet well you havent missed an awful lot and you have probably enjoyed the films anyways i wont make the ludicrous claim that you must have surround sound huge tv and comfy chair to enjoy these films nevertheless the mixes are absolutely fantastic well balanced never gimmicky during the skull avalanche the skulls are falling all around you in the battles there is fighting everywhere and there is a temptation to look behind you just in case an arrow is about to emerge from the china cabinet in the other room the dragon firework in fellowship zooms over and behind you etc etc of course the films also look great are well compressed onto dvd the features provide for some great viewing the commentaries are good and well its hard to complain okay i could complain about the scouring of the shire but what good would that do 
this is one of those all time classic great movie projects that you cannot but stand in awe of even before watching the making of documentaries that come with this set and make it abundantly clear to what lengths the entire crew went to make middle earth real creating heaps of detail that even the non casual viewer will hardly notice in the finished movie those documentaries are a treat anyway a far cry from the usual obligatory interviews with bored actors here the interviewees clearly enjoy reminiscing the intricacies of planning and design are laid bare in almost agonizing detail and the complexities of running such a project as producer or director are made keenly tangible by the end of the documentaries you may well find yourself as much attached to some of the crew members as to frodo and sam it speaks volumes about the film itself that even after you have been shown all the tricks of the trade you immediately fall under its spell nevertheless as for the trilogy itself tolkien would have been very pleased with it i feel sure he would definitely have been more pleased with the extended version than with the cinema edition though there are some diversions from his original story e g frodo sending sam home in the cirith ungol pass the extended finished trilogy is true to the book in spirit and mostly in letter too scenes that were cut from the theatrical release such as eowens heart rending dirge at eomirs funeral are instrumental in this the extended edition gives you more of the history and the culture and more of the human aspect things may slow down a bit much at times such as in sarumans verbose death scene but the book also has these leisurely moments and by the way who would want to miss the spectacular fall of the evil wizard straight down from the top of orthanc in all the eleven and a half hours of storytelling had me riveted to my seat even though i am not usually a fan of fantasy movies or battle scenes of which there are many overall the pace is expertly judged tension hardly ever sags humour and seriousness are well balanced against each other and the eye is dazzled by endless riches of costume architecture and landscape not to mention the phenomenal choreography of mass scenes sometimes as when gandalf and his riders storm down the hillside to rescue helms deep the cinematography acquires the beauty of a great classic painting weta workshop also proved highly inventive when it came to creating the weird creatures populating middle earth no doubt helped by the inspirational input from alan lee and john howe their balrog or king of the dead to mention two highlights are truly memorable and original creations excellent casting has set the seal on the success of the movie frodos tortured looks and big blue eyes work their magic even after youve learned from the documentaries that elijah wood is extremely near sighted viggo mortensen is an inscrutable even somewhat gruff hero and thus succeeds in sustaining a haze of mystery around a character that is basically very earthy and fairly unexciting i wasnt too sure about his coronation song though and ian mckellen well he simply is gandalf the set design is often breathtaking the views of minas tirith make you want to book a holiday there right away special effects have been taken to new highs in several scenes culminating in gollum who you will not for a moment be able to think of as computer generated yet other scenes betray surprisingly old fashioned artifacts the blue screen edges along sams hair against the mordor backdrop for instance or the stop motion like unreality of legolas scaling a mamuk but these are minor quibbles obviously not everything will be to everybodys taste personally i was unconvinced by the elvish decors lothlorien smacks of a fifties broadway musical set and rivendel looks rather like a glorified ski hut maybe my doubts were caused by the fact that the style of these sets is strongly reminiscent of that used in a popular dutch fairy tale theme park howard shores music which owes at least as much to wagner as tolkiens story does is mightily effective and sure to become a classic of star wars and indiana jones stature the very wagnerian fellowship and irish folk like rohan themes are particularly memorable and the five to a bar lopsided rhythm associated with mordor is equally effective but i could have done without annie lennox who sings frodo off into the west during the undeniably overly protracted final scene in the grey havens 
first i wanna say that i own the theatrical blu rays and have no problems with the quality of them i know some were disappointed in the quality of fellowship but i found it to be great was it perfect maybe not but it was a big improvement over the dvd that being said the quality of fellowship in the extended edition is improved over the theatrical blu ray the extended edition has better detail the skin tones are great and look natural and not like people have been sunburned everything looks natural looking from the trees and grass to everything else of course i have a calibrated tv and it may look different on different displays but to me the colors are wonderful on my tv now on to the green tint it is not as bad as some people are saying in fact on my calibrated hdtv i barely notice it most of the time and when i do while you can see it is there it is not so bad that it makes this release unwatchable my only small thing about this release is the dvds that come with it why they couldnt just take the extras from each film and just put them on maybe blu rays for each film is beyond me at least they have improved the packaging it is much better to retrieve discs than the old fold out packaging which makes the extra dvds not as a big deal as it could have been if it had been fold out packaging all of the extras have been ported from the original ee dvds so you get hours upon hours of special features overall this set is worth it and i recommend it 
three long excellent movies based on the book s this is the hd version of the ee dvds except no layer pausing i felt fellowship benefited the most from the extended version the movie makers took a big chance making these well known books into movies and did a great job sound and picture are great except a problem for a few viewers of fellowship which i discuss in the comments nits a conspiracy unmasked and the barrow downs did not make it into fellowship dreams and ents scenes slow two towers a bit this package has the same four commentaries per movie and voluminous extras as the ee dvds plus three extras by costa botes amazon has an excellent matrix describing what is included in each edition on this page the lord of the rings the motion picture trilogy the fellowship of the ring the two towers the return of the king extended editions blu ray very nice package with emphasis on convenience instead of the bulky dvds each movie is on two bds plus three dvds of extras 
if you want the basic story of lord of the rings as in frodo carries the ring of power to mordor and aragorn becomes king of gondor then the theatrical versions of these films will do if you want to immerse yourself in the world of middle earth learn more about the characters and have a better understanding of the film then the extended versions are the only ones you need for those of you who have seen both the theatrical and extended versions then there should be no debate as to what the superior versions are every extended version is a vast improvement over its theatrical counterpart so much so that they render the theatrical versions unwatchable would you rather read the lord of the rings by j r r tolkien or by cliff notes ill be the first to admit that there are added scenes in all three extended versions that do not necessarily move the plot foward but they give you more insight into the characters and world of middle earth the lord of the rings is the motion picture event of the century the theatrical versions of these films on their own are truly remarkable the extended versions improve on the theatrical versions in every way 
quick thoughts on popular complaints re double dipping money grubbing to anyone who bought the theatrical edition blu ray set my sympathies but then why in the heck did you spend the money in the first place it was obvious to any rational person that the ee would eventually see the light of day it happened with the dvd release and it was confirmed for the bd release mere weeks after the theatrical set was announced how impatient does a person have to be to buy an inferior release and then complain about a superior one down the road re seamless branching i just dont think there was a way to put both theatrical and ee movies with all commentaries on one disc and then seamlessly branch them a la close encounters the movies are too long for one thing and the ee flicks were completely re edited with new music extended scenes and so on if you really want a seamlessly branched set get the limited edition dvd frankly the ee is superior in every way and i do not feel the need to watch the inferior truncated versions re being split over discs the films have been encoded as files roughly gb in size each movie pushes four hours and has a dts hd soundtrack to leave room for the movies as well as the audio commentaries apiece they were split onto to two gb bds and yes they are gb dual layer discs actually look at the center of the discs before you write yet another stupid review claiming that theyre on single layer gb discs anyway live with it it has resulted in wonderful video quality cramming them films onto one disc would have resulted in a substandard a v presentation if you dont care about video quality buy either a cruddy bootleg or the theatrical edition complaining about this is like complaining that vinyl lps have sides re the color timing issue wow if ever there was a mountain made out of a molehill it is this fotr is not green it does not have an undue green tint the snow is not green the faces are not green the sky is not green ive watched the whole thing through very carefully and there is no point at which i felt the color balancing was off flesh tones are realistic whites are white the color looks very similar to the ee dvd set better if you ask me because that release ran a little hot in the reds i kind of wonder if the people who are complaining have poorly calibrated equipment or bad eyesight if your display is calibrated anywhere close to a k color temperature usually the warmest color setting in your user menu and your gamma is set well you will find nothing to complain about here folks i am a picky viewer i have vision i calibrate my displays with discs like dve and avia to get them as close as possible to accurate color i care about these sorts of issues and i can say unequivocally that the color on these discs including fotr is absolutely fine it looks perfectly natural and pleasing on all of these issues you should decide for yourself dont be swayed by serial complainers and people with bad televisions at least rent the discs before you decide to boycott them for life ok with that all out of the way here goes the real review the movies of course are one of the finest achievements in fantasy storytelling well basically ever the writing is true to the books with a few exceptions made for brevity if a little self important and overly portentous the acting is uniformly excellent with all players taking the material seriously the production values still havent been topped the locations are spectacular and the cgi hasnt been beaten as far as integrating it with real live action shots the music is great too this blu ray set presents the three extended edition movies on two discs apiece all of the extras from the dvd sets are reprised here including the costa botes documentaries from the later limited edition release it is a disappointment that the extras none of which are in hd were not simply dropped onto one gb blu ray disc per movie no sacrifice in quality would have been made and convenience would be increased significantly but its a minor quibble at least new line and whv didnt also include a disc or two for the digital editions of the movies the video presentations on these blu rays are reference quality pure and simple detail is extremely strong throughout all three films hair facial wrinkles and pores cloth textures and foliage all pop off the screen with true high definition detail these releases are way better than the theatrical blu rays in this respect especially fotr comparing screen shots from one to the other is almost like comparing dvd to bd its really night and day also particularly impressive are the depth of black and shadow detail these are dark movies folks and if you have your displays brightness and gamma set well you will be rewarded with an absolute ton of detail near black audio is presented in dts hd master audio tracks dialogue is crisp and clear positional audio is strong the low channels get an aggressive workout pretty much non stop the packaging is nice too a sturdy gold colored slipcase with a magnetic door flap holds the bd cases each of which is a disc plastic leaf case similar to the blade runner ultimate edition in conclusion if youve been waiting to buy these on blu ray wait no longer i dont see how the video or the audio could be improved the griping on internet forums about color timing is fictitious drivel you will sacrifice no extra features in swapping these in for your ee dvds the movies themselves are of course timeless classics for this price it is simply a must buy for any fan of the films and any fan of high quality hd movies for their home theater setup 
this is by far the best lotr box set it contains the same extended versions as the us set but is housed in a wooden box lined with black velvet the inner box is the same as the us version it also includes a deck of lotr playing cards inside a drawstring pouch this item was not meant to be sold outside of taiwan so copies are very hard to come by if you have a multi region player and are a die hard fan this is the set for you 
when i first saw these movies in theaters i thought they were perfect when i owned them i thought they were fantastic then when the extended editions came out i thought how could you make plus hour movies better and keep my attention then they release them on blu ray and this is the pinnacle of perfection for these movies if you were fan of them before youll still love them theres just a better picture to see and feel everything three masterpieces and all the goodies you can shake a stick at excellent
beginning in and the two subsequent years that followed a trilogy of amazing films were presented to audiences based upon j r r tolkiens literary masterpiece the lord of the rings when the first film the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring was released in theaters it was minutes long just under hours then in the fall of a special extended version of the film was released on dvd that included an additional minutes this extra minutes of scenes was not simply tacked onto the dvd to be viewed in a separate deleted scenes menu instead director peter jackson reincorporated all minutes of various scenes back into the original film with additional music composed and recorded specifically to make their reintegration seamless the result was an even more impressive minute film that increased the depth of the story primarily with the elves similarly when the second film the lord of the rings the two towers was released in theaters in late it was minutes long as with the first film peter jackson reintegrated minutes of scenes for the second film that were not part of the original theatrical release for the special extended version that was released on dvd in the fall of the result was a far more interconnected and detailed film that included scenes with the father of boromir sean bean and faramir david wenham denethor john noble those who did not watch the special extended version of the lord of the rings the two towers did not see denethor until the third film was released in theaters in late the lord of the rings the return of the king which was minutes long this was nearly as long as the special extended version of the first film finally after months of anticipation the special extended version of the third film that has an additional minutes of footage will be released next month though i cannot yet comment on the additional footage that i havent yet seen i fully expect it to be an even more exciting experience than watching the theatrical release between the three theatrically released films which total minutes hours minutes the total amount of additional film for all three special extended versions comes to minutes hours minutes this means that all three special extended versions total minutes or hours minutes between the theatrical special extended versions my preference is for the special extended versions overall my rating for all three special extended films is a resounding out of stars for people who have already purchased one or both of the previously released individual special extended versions purchase of the lord of the rings the motion picture trilogy special extended dvd edition probably wont be worth the expense however if you havent previously purchased either of the previously released individual special extended versions then this combined special extended version dvd collection is well worth the price it would also make a fantastic gift for anyone that wants to watch all three special extended versions and doesnt yet have any of them on dvd i extend my personal thanks to peter jackson the fine actors and film crew who brought j r r tolkiens lord of the rings trilogy to life these three films will no doubt entertain audiences for many decades to come 
this trilogy is the greatest set of movies ever based on the greatest set of books ever as many people said before and after the movies were released it would be impossible to bring every facet of j r r tolkiens masterpiece to life in a movie but this rendition is the best anyone could ever do in my opinion yes events from the books are left out even in the extended versions and some events and characters are even changed because of the reality of trying to turn a thousand page book into or hours of movie i mean how many people could read all three books in even twice the time it takes to watch all of the extended films everything from the books simply could not be put into any kind of feasible movie and the purists should simply get over it and find something better to complain about 
if youre looking for a holiday gift for a lotr fan buy this for them they definitely dont have it because its the new extended edition set this is the box set that most of us have been waiting for there are hours of additional footage so youre only adding to their lotr experience i dont own any of the extended films yet because i have been waiting for this opportunity to purchase them all together you might be wondering if the extra footage is worth it it definitely is ive been renting them while patiently waiting for this release yeah maybe im a geek but i see a lotr movie marathon in my future trust me if you know someone that likes fantasy lotr maybe even harry potter get this youll get guaranteed smiles and the set looks hot on a book shelf if you like my review please vote for it any questions you can im me wintergetsme michele
i am not a lord of the rings fanatic i did go see all three in the movie theater with my wife and they were good thoroughly enjoyable films but i felt no need to see them a second or third time fast forward to today and my kids are now teenagers and i have a killer home theater set up i bought the extended blu ray version thinking it must be better right wrong more does not necessarily mean better you can ruin a pie by putting too much sugar in it and while everyone here things that you must own the longer versions i can emphatically say after watching the longer versions that i will never do that again the added footage is done spectacularly well i cannot tell you where or how the extra footage is added the music the footage and everything else was done top notch in the case of disk and disk i did not mind the extra length that much as both those disks are under four hours long but the last disk return of the king tops out at four hours and minutes it really got campy at the end for the last minutes of the film as each scene is drawn out into longer and longer melodramatic moments our entire family started to chuckle and make fun of the film by that point we were completely done with it most of the extra footage at that point did not seem to add much to film and in fact started to highlight some of its shortcomings that had escaped me in the theater if i ever sit down to watch these again i will go back to what i saw in the theater it was fantastic then and they are the real versions of the film to begin with 
this set will probably be the last one i bought in searching for the best edition of the lord of the rings trilogy first it was the dvd release dvds for each of the three movies i didnt buy any of the subsequent dvd releases but then blu ray era came and i have been waiting for the br d release of the trilogy eventually i bought it from the uk amazon site due to the region limitation region b which is the only version my current br disc player can read but then i saw the pictures videos of the us version the plastic boxes looked better and i started watching this item on american sites in addition i read something about that when a movie is being transferred from the original ntsc into pal european standard sound pitch is being corrected due to frame per second difference etc in other words some loss may be there in the european version although i might be wrong oh then i noticed that different versions exist maybe more the description for the one i am writing this review for claimed it was all regions one having checked some info sites i decided to buy it when i received it i realized i was bloody right all blu ray discs with the movie are free from regional restriction plays on either br d played region b and ps region a cases are much thinner than in the uk version thus making the whole box thinner and they are black cool i also think that the design of the inner papers in those boxes is better in these us discs than in the uk ones colors textures trademarks the booklets are also not that wide to make them starting bend when put in the boxes noticed in the uk version in other words i think that this was my last investment in the movie because i found the version that will provide the best possible quality on any blu ray disc players i doubt that some new technology will appear to improve the picture or sound of the masters on the not negative but rather other part the bonus discs are region encoded so for playing them buyers will need to have players able to play region discs and i think buyers should be informed on that part yes i have both versions now region and region but keeping different packages for being able to play bonus discs only is not the best pleasant thing however with this set i now have all three behind the scenes documentaries by costa botes which i would not get otherwise due to not wishing to buy another dvd release of the trilogy in the end i should say that something should always left for the future and now i will need to find an ultimate blu ray disc release of the theatrical versions of the trilogy why because these versions are different the extended is much better and full and etc but for the collectors there are many shots frames sequences and different cuts used in the theatrical versions but this is just another story 
by now most people will have seen the movies and have an idea where they stand on them if you really love the movies and want to see them with the most material possible then get the extended editions they add a lot of extra scenes into the movies fellowship and two towers each clock in around three and a half hours and return of the king at just under hours for each movie there are two blu rays and three dvds the movies stretch across the two blu ray discs this was done to keep the a v quality as high as possible and it is actually not a bad thing because if you have to stop the movie it will not pick back up where you stopped it you have to go back and find where you were at that is really my only complaint because it is damn near impossible to watch any of the movies straight through without a break so the switching point gives you kind of a natural intermission then each movie has two appendices discs to follow the appendices ideas from the books those are basically a bunch of making of features that interview the cast and crew the amount of material on those discs are even longer than the actual movies then you get a behind the scenes disc that had around hours of just raw footage showing the films being made in all you get discs with hours and hours of bonus material like i said above by now most people know where the stand on the movies if you are just a casual fan or thought they were okay but not great then dont bother with the extended edition because it is going to be overkill and not worth the money if you loved the movies and love watching the bonus material when you get the physical discs then you will be very happy with what you get here 
at over hr movies some poeple might think that they would get boring to watch but it really doesnt having won a ton of academy awards you cant say these movies were bad this is one of the best trilogies made so far and has the best special effects ever gollum frodo and the rest of the crew are all part of this trilogy that make it one of the best in the world the fight scenes are awesome the acting is awesome everything is awesome the movies star elijah wood ian mckellen liv tyler sean astin and viggo mortensen plus many other great actors but i do not recommend buying this set just wait for the special extended edition set of each movie that includes each disc set made for each movie you get a lot more movie and a lot more special features if you buy this regular theatrical set its about if you buy the special extended edition trilogy set its about for more your getting more discs total 
note if you havent seen the movies there may be slight spoilers below in the description of the three movies nothing particular though i am of the opinion that the lord of the rings film trilogy is one of the best films all right film collections ever made if not the best everything you could ask for in a movie acting special effects great dialogue thats heart lifting but somehow always stops short of being cheesy emotional depth storytelling characters so real you know them faithfulness to one of the best books of all time its all there and not only is it great its flawless perfect it does what many people thought was impossible does justice to the book that really made the fantasy genre the book many people call the best of the th century ah did i forget to mention the music howard shore proved that hes one of the best composers of the age with the soundtracks for lord of the rings hes captured everything from the simple and happiness loving hobbits in concerning hobbits to the tension and edge of your seat drama of shelobs lair and the end of all things to the heartbreaking yet happy is that even possible the grey havens no matter how much i like or dislike a movie i think from now on i will buy any soundtrack by howard shore the extended version is the version to have really if youre at all a fan of the book or even the movies alone you have to have the extended versions the wonderful thing about the lotr movies is that the theatrical editions stand by themselves perfectly understandably and yet the extended versions dont seem boring or extraneous to the contrary they simply enrich the world add to the tapestry and satisfy obsessive fans who wanted to see every scene the first movie fellowship of the ring introduces you to middle earth its races and its characters it shows you frodo baggins a young hobbit who has just inherited his uncle bilbos magic ring only to find that this ring has the power to in the wrong hands overthrow all that is good in the world with eight other companions frodo begins his journey toward mount doom the volcano where the ring must be destroyed the second movie is the two towers after parting with the other members of the fellowship frodo and sam begin to make their way toward mordor at the same time aragorn legolas and gimli track the orcs that have kidnapped the hobbits merry and pippin merry and pippin though manage to rescue themselves and fall straight into the path of treebeard the ent it is up to merry and pippin to convince the ents to rise up against the evil wizard saruman in his stronghold of isengard the third movie return of the king is the best in my opinion and apparently in the opinion of the people who give out academy awards since rotk won eleven of them it involves pippin and merry in gondor and rohan serving their respective lords aragorns path of self discovery that leads him to eventually take up his place as king of gondor and frodo sam and gollums arduous journey to mordor to destroy the ring so many people have said this already that i know im just being redundant but this trilogy really is one of the best films film collections ever made i certainly havent seen better its not the sort of thing that will ever be dated even when the special effects are old cant see that happening for a few centuries its a classic like the book was and i honestly cant think of one way peter jackson or new line could have made it better this is one movie collection that deserves far more than five stars rating masterpiece
i wont lie to ya the star wars saga is still my favorite film series its just hardwired into me by now but i have to give credit where credit is due what peter jackson accomplished here is amazing here are the details lord of the rings the fellowship of the ringa long absent evil returns to loom over the free lands of middle earth and it needs only the one ring to become an unstoppable force of destruction luckily the one ring of power lost for over three thousand years has come into the hands of a humble young hobbit named frodo baggins with the benign wizard gandalf the grey to instruct him frodo and his best friend samwise gamgee travel with two other hobbit companions to the woodland realm of the elves led by a mysterious ranger called strider once there the band of heroes is joined by legolas the elf a nobleman named boromir and gimli the dwarf forming the fellowship of the ring it is the quest of the fellowship to take the evil ring to the fires of mount doom in the land of mordor to destroy it it is a perilous journey however along the way they must face monstrous creatures such as orcs ringwraiths cave trolls goblins and all manner of other horrors but they will also discover the distant majesties of their world the fascinating cultures beautiful beings and awe inspiring landscapes they must always remain on guard though because there are less obvious dangers lurking as well the dark lord saurons demonic eye is ever watchful his spies seek out the hobbits in search of the one ring and the ring itself is the greatest danger of all its wicked power seeks to envelop all who are near and lead them to certain doom lord of the rings two towersthe fellowship of the ring has been cut down and scattered as aragorn gimli and legolas go forth on a rescue mission to save merry and pippin now prisoners of the bloodthirsty uruk hai the burden of the one ring grows heavier on little frodo baggins his only comfort and support on his long journey to mordor is the steadfast faith and loyalty of his best friend samwise gamgee when the hobbit pair fall under attack by a former ring bearer the creature gollum they soon enlist his aid as a guide on their quest but can he be trusted for years the ring poisoned gollums mind now gollum is a broken soul he struggles between a desire for redemption and a lust for the precious frodo seeks to reform the creature in order to gain hope for his own struggle with the ring but sam despises the pitiful gollum and cannot understand frodos need to show mercy meanwhile our other two hobbit heroes merry and pippin seize an opportunity for freedom and soon find themselves consorting with an entirely new type of creature the towering ents who could provide great help against the evil wizard saruman and his army following their own course aragorn gimli and legolas soon find themselves reunited with an old friend and helping defend a kings stronghold helms deep from saurons deadly forces the culmination is a thrilling battle with little hope of victory and yet it is only the beginning of saurons war on mankind and the freedom of middle earth lord of the rings the return of the kingthe end is near as the evil lord saurons legions set forth to destroy all of mankind aragorn must meet his destiny and make a final stand for the forces of good with friends legolas gimli and the great wizard gandalf at his side aragorn will have to reclaim his birthright as king in order to save the people and land that he loves but it will all be for nothing if frodo and sam do not make it to the fires of mordor to destroy the one ring of power with the untrustworthy gollum as their guide anything could happen before they are able to accomplish their goal and who will survive the great battle both merry and pippin have been recruited for unlikely military positions and the beautiful eowyn is determined to make her stand on the battlefield as well none of the fellowship is free of danger in this final awe inspiring battle to save middle earth from the wicked eye of sauron and his ring of power the trilogybased on the renowned books by author j r r tolkien the lord of the rings is a three part fantasy epic that is mindblowing to say the least director peter jackson surprisingly coming from a no budget splatter film background brings the world of middle earth to fantastic and astonishing reality intense detail in every aspect of the filmmaking process has resulted in a trilogy like no other it is difficult to single out performances here for every cast member is perfection however much acclaim is rightly given to actor sean astin in the powerful and emotional role of samwise gamgee best friend of frodo baggins seans performance is tremendous and propels the struggle of frodo and the ring to an astounding level of course this is not to take away from elijah woods brilliant portrayal of frodo or viggo mortensens as aragorn all the other cast members are fantastic as well especially the wonderful ian mckellan as gandalf the wizard and one must make note of the entirely digital creature gollum brought stunningly to life with amazingly realistic computer effects and the wonderful talent of andy serkis theres a small but strong female presence as well in such forms as the bewitching elf princess arwen played by liv tyler and the fierce but lovely eowyn played with great warmth and believability by miranda otto id also like to add that sarah mcleod who plays the tiny role of sams love interest rosie cotton is absolutely adorable probably my favorite female in the saga in addition to the outstanding cast and direction the visual effects are flawless the music is inspiring and the settings are incomparable the great attention to detail results in a medieval world that fantastic as it is seems real the languages are real the various cultures are in depth the creatures are amazing the battles are astounding and intense and at the heart of it all are poweful life lessons to keep with you long after the movies are over this is filmmaking at its finest can any one film of the trilogy stand alone as a viewing experience yes and no the films are each fantastic and plenty lengthy though there is never a dull moment but they are unquestionably all one single story they must all be seen consecutively and in order though you dont have to watch them all in one day this collection of disc dvd editions of the lord of the rings trilogy presents the films as they were released in theaters with a fine collection of extras that include making of featurettes a wonderful national geographic special comparing the lord of the rings saga to real world history several short web featurettes music videos theatrical trailers and tv spots a supertrailer for the entire saga video game previews a charming short film called the long and the short of it by sean astin a featurette on the making of the long and the short of it and previews of the special extended edition dvds of the films thats right some time after the release of these theatrical editions extended editions of the already lengthy films were released on dvd those must be really long and they probably have some great extras too maybe the audio commentaries or production art we dont get here regardless even peter jackson refers to the theatrical releases as the preferred versions so make your choice you might even feel like owning both versions any way you go you cant lose an amazing film saga and the final chapter even won best picture at the academy awards a fantasy film won best picture in the past there have been animated versions of the lord of the rings and the preceding tale by j r r tolkien the hobbit you may want to discover these for yourself i cant wholeheartedly recommend them as i havent seen them since childhood and i recall the animation being a bit weak to say the least still its been a long time but dont expect them to come anywhere near these versions also recommended for lord of the rings fans the black cauldron the dark crystal labyrinth legend the last unicorn the princess bride the sword in the stone excalibur dragonslayer merlin the harry potter series the star wars saga still my favorite film series but im a longtime fan indiana jones and the last crusade monty python and the holy grail willow clash of the titans robin hood prince of thieves troy kingdom of heaven army of darkness fantasia braveheart the patriot and im sure im forgetting many more also check out the stars of the lord of the rings in some of my all time favorite films sean astin in the goonies elijah wood in the adventures of huck finn christopher lee in the hammer dracula films ian mckellen in the x men films john rhys davies in raiders of the lost ark and orlando bloom in pirates of the caribbean and pick up peter jacksons king kong another extraordinary achievement oh and visit my gallery at slave moonlight deviantart com to read my disney lord of the rings fan comic its only pages in as i write this review but its somewhat entertaining if i do say so myself ha 
for one of the best movies ever the extras on these discs in all are by far the best that i have ever seen for a movie the part documentary on jrr is really cool so are pretty much all of the making ofs it would take years to review all teh extras this has but i will comment on the commentaries the cast commentary is the only time i can remeber really enjoying a commentary everybody is energetic in taliking the director writer comm is ok and there are other commentaries that i have not had the chance to listen to the movies themselves are very much helped by putting in deleted scenes and the extended scenes are even better maybe higher 
you already know that the movies rock this blu ray has a mordor size worth of extras the movies themselves look incredible in pristine p buy it and show your support so we get a good set when the hobbit comes out 
the lotr special editions are truly mindblowing the amount of extra content is actually worth the cost of buying completely new editions of movies you probably already own what you get extended cuts of each movie with never before seen footage discs and extensive documentaries detailing the history of the lotr j r r tolkien the production of the films and alot more discs and if youre interested in how the lotr came to be in its written form you should buy this set it contains the best documentaries produced to date on the subject the bonus discs also include hours of documentaries that range from costume design prop design set design well virtualy all the design that went into making these films the are approximately hours of documentaries on the bonus discs included for each film plus concept design stills and other goodies truly amazing if youre interested in how movies are made this would also be a sound purchase for you there are or is it commentary tracks for each movie each one is interesting in its own way although youll most likely only listen to the writers and stars commentaries the movies themselves are worth watching again unlike many directors cuts available today these sets actually enhance the story being told in the trilogy instead of adding every possible scrap of cinematography back into these movies jackson has added those scenes he feels flesh out the narrative and enrich the world of middle earth every movie has a new score to keep the experience as seamless as possible no shoddy chop jobs here this is honestly everything it claims to be a special extended dvd edition if you havent bought this yet and any of this content interests you go buy it youll love it 
for those fans of this series who want to own all three extended versions i highly recommend you buy all three films separately as the grand total will be cheaper than buying this box set also if you want to get the slipcase cover box that holds all three extended version boxes that is only available when you buy all three together if you buy the return of the king extended version you will find that it comes with a coupon that lets you get the slipcase cover for all three movies for only go lotr 
this set is spectacular the hours of extra behind the scenes information is as good as the movies i watched the trilogy and then watched the bonus material it was so informative and fascinating that i had to watch the movies again to compare and see what they were talking about the in depth information about weta in particular is wonderful 
this is the best blu ray box set i have ever purchased not to mention that the movies look ridiculously good and that they sound phenomenal they are the true extended cuts which feature more comedy lore action and overall more of the lotr goodies that we love the set also includes which i thought was awesome if you know what i mean special features discs with an absolutely stupid amount of content from fantastic scene explanations with peter jackson beautiful concept galleries and more these are truly special features to watch when i bought this i thought can i sit through these movies again especially since they are nearly nearly four hours and over hours a piece well i was proven i could and they are phenomenal i even like them more than the original theatrical editions not to mention digital copies are always a plus and now i can watch them everywhere the only con for this set is that the special features are not high definition that is disappointing but the fact that there are so many makes up for that other than that quip this box set is one to own to keep and pass on throughout the ages 
this package of the lord of the rings trilogy with the theatrical versions of all movies has the advantage compared to the extended edition set that this one is way cheaper i got mine for around whereas the extended edition was priced at at the time if you are a real fan of the lord of the rings you should go pick the extended edition but if budget is an issue then this version will do you good it still has the movies maybe with a lot less content but in the end i dont think the difference is worth bucks or three times the price quality wise the content is great movie looks just awesome and it will give you some good hours of entertainment and a great addition to your blu ray collection 
i had not ever seen any of them before but i went to go see the hobbit part one with my best friend and it was not bad then a few weeks later my boyfriend forced me to get them and watch them so i did i could not stop watching them i watched all three in one day shows i have a life but they were great i reccommend them im a girl that isnt really into movies like this but it was actually highly enjoyable i even noticed my body tensing up at some of the actions scenes haha i highly recommend the whole triology 
the extended edition movies are audacious and inspiring all other current electronic entertainment options shrink into insignificance in comparison with these dvds but what you really get with all the dvd commentaries and extra features is an intense education in what it takes to make a modern motion picture its all here pre production planning screen writing casting acting production and post production i predict the hours of content on the dvds will be mandatory viewing material for new film students for years to come and current film makers will also no doubt mine the material to help improve their own film making processes seven years of world class film production have been condensed into this brilliant package an awesome achievement 
where do you begin to describe such an incredibly well done movie series this is one of the most beautiful gripping and epic stories you will ever have the privilege to watch as a big fan of tolkien since my early teen years about years ago i have read the trilogy several times and can attest that the movies most assuredly do justice to the books admittedly it was necessary to cut some scenes for the sake of keeping the movie length at a manageable level for example the whole episode with tom bombadil and the barrow wights is left out however nothing was omitted that is necessary and important for the uninitiated viewer to follow and understand the story if anything the movie is actually easier to follow than the books because some arguably unnecessary history is left out the production quality of the whole series simply defies words you have to see it for yourself to appreciate it the visual appearance of the film far surpassed my imagination and expectations as a repeat reader of these books the characters the costumes the make up the grand settings and all the little details that go into them were well thought out and obviously received a great deal of care and attention it is evident that the producers took great pains to make films worthy of tolkiens masterpiece and i believe they accomplished their goal with specific reference to this extended edition dvd set its definitely worth the little bit of extra money if youre a tolkien afficionado the three movie boxes are designed to look like a boxed set of the books there are four discs in each of the three movie boxes for a total of twelve discs each set includes two movie discs and two special feature discs along with a small guidebook explaining what is in each including a listing of all the new and extended scenes these scenes are what make this trilogy set so worthwhile because they add so much flavor and nuance to an already great movie series bravo 
peter kings master piece would not be complete with out the release of his extended edition simular to the lord of the rings triolgy in printed version the extended eddition captures the brillance of tolkens triumph picture and sound quality are amazing this is a visual and audio fiest on an epic proportion this is a must have movie 
this is the set everyone has been waiting for i held off buying the normal trilogy for about two years this extended edition set is the one you want to buy and for thats a no brainier amazing set highly recommended 
the lord of the rings the motion picture trilogy a great addition to you video library with the additional scenes and the ability to pause and rewind the perfect addition to a geek fest weekend
unlike many of the reviewers of this product i didnt buy versions of these movies i only bought the extended editions on dvd i also have no intention of buying them on blu ray i do plan on buying this for reasons i dont already own the theatrical edition and its cheap if and when they come up with the double version set on blu ray do you honestly think itll be less than youll be paying more for that set than you wouldve if youd bought both blu ray versions separately i dont see what you people are complaining about when this product is clearly labeled as what it is the only reason it would deserve less than stars would be if they advertised it to be something different 
watching on a samsung i found the video and audio quality to be superb a significant step up from the dvds and the theatrical blu rays which i have i have not noticed a blue tint or anything like that my family even commented on the clarity and quality of the picture which is saying much because they dont usually notice if you are a lotr fan like me then this is a must have in your collection 
i seen them all in the theater and waited for a long time for it to come out on blue ray having a large high def t v which took me months to choose looking for the best picture quality i finally settled on one that when some guy shot a putt across the green you could see every blade of grass as the ball rolled but enough on the t v the movie was par excellent better then in the theatre i was super impressed with the colours and how it seemed to come to life i wont go into movie details since everyone has already and most have seen the movie for the die hard fans the blue ray is the way to go just make sure you have a t v worth watching it on there are those that claim great pictures but after a long search i found the one that is true colour and plays well with my blue ray and sound system would i recommend this to anyone yes and highly i will never buy another dvd again its blue ray all the way i am even waiting for the blue ray extended edition of the hobbit this december as an fyi i did not get a sony or vizo t v since i have friends who are japanese and have warned me they are junk made for americans so choose wisely and get something that can show every blade of grass when someone putts a golf ball and is not a blur its well worth the extra money since the t v matters the most as well as a good blue ray player for viewing it properly sorry my review is not about the movie i was more impressed by the colours and sounds of the movie and am glad i picked the right t v for this that is what is important also dont skip on hdmi cables get the top of the line it makes all the difference in the world too good luck and hopefully this helps make a good decision for you 
the lord of the rings the motion picture trilogy is a beautiful box set that showcases these three amazing films the fellowship of the ring the two towers and the return of the king from the captivating story to the gorgeous cinematography this trilogy sweeps you off of your feet and takes you along for one heck of a journey the lord of the rings the motion picture trilogy has to be one of the most anticipated dvd releases ever i encourage any one who appreciates great movies to purchase this wonderful box set this is what great movies are about 
let me first say that this is probably the finest group of films telling one story ever made surpassing star wars and even the godfather the acting cinematograpgy and effects both sound and visual are virtually flawless i own all three of the theatrical versions but have been waiting to get all three extended films in one get go the extended films so far have been far superior to even their award winning theatrical cousins and in the return of the king extended edition people will get important parts that were left out such as the houses of healing and gandalfs confrontation with the witch king if you are one of the or so people who havent seen these movies i strongly suggest ordering this box set the pre order price is a steal for films of such high quality and the oodles of extras that come with them now if we can only get tarantino to release the uncut kill bill compleate 
first there is virtually no green tint and my display is calibrated to d k if amything fellowship is the most accurate looking of the i had never seen the extended editions before purchasing this set and i cant believe how much i missed the movies are much more coherent and make so much more sense there is a human factor that seems to have been missing in the theatrical versions which were seemingly void of humor and character this set made me go from thinking that peter jackson didnt do that great of a job to thinking that he did quite a good job at capturing the atmosphere of the book i dont understand why they cut out so much from these for theaters 
except to spend a lot of couch time and it is worth it the level of detail provided as to why certain scenes were added not added or changed makes understanding the movies well worthwhile especially for fans of the book even the details as to the color hues used to make for an overall theme especially in the second movie the two towers allows one to gain an appreciation of the craft of making the film each blu ray movie requires two discs and the supplemental material is on regular dvds digital download was smooth the only negative i find is that the behind the scenes disc is rather lame but the appendix discs are well worth it they often joked about what they would put into the th anniversary edition so all i can say is stay tuned my approach to watching is that i watched the movie then the commentary then the appendices and then on to the next movie this isnt done in a day 
without a doubt the lord of the rings trilogy is the best movies ever made while many have complained that all three are way to long i think that lotr arent the kind of movies one would want to watch in five hours first off it would be so short that the characters wouldnt seem real enough also so much would have to be cut out that the story wouldnt make much sense the extended editions are especially nice because you get to know each of the characters better many scenes added while not vital to the story help one understand the movie a little better i remember watching the extended edition of the fellowship of the ring and realizing how much more i was getting from the movie the same goes for the other two the characters are more developed and the story not as rushed along i most definitely recommend buying the lord of the rings trilogy special extended edition 
i bought it for my girlfriend but its basically ours and we both love it it looks phenominal on bluray and there are so many features im so glad they released an extended addition for lord of the rings nothing else to say other than its well worth the money especially at thats for each bluray disc 
this is one of the best set of movies ever made very faithful to the tolkein books this is a powerful fantasy story of love duty honor faithfulness and all other virtues it is also a story of receipt betrayal greed and power it has everything very well cast acted and directed i keep coming back to this trilogy 
i have never seen the extended versions until now these movies are just so awesome the picture quality is soooo good and the audio is just unbelievable i would highly recommend buying this set especially since its on sale right now until june rd for bucks you will not be disappointed stars for the movie and stars for the packaging its really neat and well made so this whole set is just wonderful and i forgot that their is hours of special features yea buddy 
lord of the rings are films in which the visual plays a very important role prior releases in dvd were never up to its grandiosity neither were the theatrical cut blu rays with their well known transfer problems but now this edition brings the trilogy in its full details sharp and clear in picture and sound some people noticed changes in color grading but of course that perception depends on what you take as a comparison as far as i know no one can really tell whether this slightly changed color is shifting away or towards the original grading it is pointless to compare this transfer with the previous dvds ou blu rays for all we know those previous transfers could be the wrong ones picture is perfect i use a p home theater projector and these blu rays hold up bautifuly even when playing onto a inch screen as for the extended versions they do have a much longer running time but they are never boring if you love these movies this is the edition you must have sorry bout english mistakes its a foreign language to me 
although there a few missteps in p j s lord of the rings some of them have to do with insufficient development of and truncated plot developments this extended set largely addresses those 
i was waiting this extend edition i bought with some doubts about the extra material but it was more that i expected the price was so convenient 
i wont belabor the points that others have made so well before me lord of the rings is simply the best fantasy to come to film ever these films were crafted with an eye to authenticity and loving detail and are worthy of the timeless classic that inspired them i came late to tolkien having started fellowship of the ring just a few days before the first movie opened the books better for of movie adaptations but these films are so perfectly cast with the faces and scenery that i envisioned when i read the books its impossible for me to pick a favorte the extended versions of the films add footage that provides useful explanations for plot points and characterization scenery from new zealand is breathtaking acting is award winning music is beyond moving i think the only thing that might make this better is to package the soundtracks for the three films together with this edition buy these films you will want to see them over and over 
peter jacksons adaptation of tolkiens epic trilogy the lord of the rings could very well be the greatest film saga of our time all three films are very well written produced and directed the scenery of the locations and sets is nothing short of breathtaking the cast members all turn in some outstanding performances especially viggo mortensen ian mckellen liv tyler elijah wood john rhys davies sean astin and christopher lee to name a few jackson matches and then surpasses george lucas ability to tell an epic tale of good versus evil earlier this year the return of the king joined the godfather part ii as the only sequels to ever win the oscar for best picture and now new line home entertainment has released the extended edition dvd set for the return of the king and made the entire extended edition trilogy available in this disc set which includes additoinal footage not shown in the cinematic releases minutes added to the fellowship of the ring minutes added to the two towers and minutes added to the return of the king also included are cast and crew interviews in depth documentaries behind the scenes footage interactive maps cast and filmmaker commentaries and much more composer howard shore has added new scores to complete the extended versions of each film and hundreds of new digital effects have been created decades from now the lord of the rings trilogy will still be remembered as one of the greatest film sagas in cinematic history and now with the extended edition trilogy box set new line and peter jackson have given us the completed version of this wonderful film trilogy 
ive noticed a lot of people are waiting and buying the trilogy set because they want the box but theres another way to get the box the same box that comes with the trilogy set for people who bought the first two lotr se and have just picked up the last se lotr rotk youll find a mini fold out mail in rebate booklet that comes with it printed on the front cover of this booklet youll find an url that offers the trilogy box free yes free plus for shipping and handling for people who couldnt wait for the trilogy set to come out and knowing theres absolutely nothing different between buying the three lotr se separately and buying trilogy set aside from the box this information is nothing short of absolute joy 
 disks check crazy long movies check definitely worth the price and its the extended cut so you get like endings at the end 
certainly if youre any kind of lord of the rings fan youll want these dvds just for the extra scenes they do an excellent job of fleshing out the story filling in important details such as how frodo gets the phial of galadriel or what happens to saruman the wizard for those with serious time constraints the six dvds lend themselves handily to leisurely watching the movies one dvd at a time over six weekends or of course you can throw sanity to the wind and watch all of the nearly twelve hours in one single ringathon session about the only scene in the entire extended epic which i didnt much care for was the mouth of sauron it was just plain creepy and the way aragorn dealt with the mouth was out of character and differed too much from the book but the beauty of dvd players is that most come with fast forward buttons so no big deal however the complete extended edition consists not of six but of twelve dvds disks three and four for each movie are filled with extras documentaries interactive maps still photos and interactive videos one of the latter allows you to go through a scene at helms deep and progressively add in different sound effects to a silent video until you get the finished result in the film a similar video depicting the mmakil battle in front of minas tirith allows you to progressively add in the special effects i have to say that as excellent as the movies are the extras are even more fascinating if you can imagine such a thing ive already been through all of the documentaries not once but twice each dvd has on average about three hours of video so i find that it takes me about six to eight weekends to work my way through the entire lot if youre interested in the art of filmmaking this material is an absolute must it takes you through the entire process of adapting the novels to screenplays storyboarding animatics on through production the actual filming pickup shots and post production adding the special effects sounds and music and figuring out how to put it all together and what to leave out collectively these movies won academy awards with return of the king alone tying ben hur and titanic for the most ever for a film by the time you get through all the documentaries youll fully appreciate what a staggering accomplishment director peter jackson pulled off and why he deserved every award he got he could not have done it at all were it not for the shared vision of hundreds of fanatically dedicated workers working sometimes around the clock to make sure every detail was exactly right it was a stroke of genius on peters part to recruit alan lee and john howe both of whom are well known tolkien artists this allowed peter to give the movies such an uncannily familiar look and feel you look at the golden hall of edoras and say of course thats what meduseld looked like i knew it all along it would be impossible to cover all of the extras so ill just focus on some of my favorites at the start of disk three for each movie is a biographical section on tolkien and the kind of things that inspired him to pen the lord of the rings there is a documentary on the various tricks used to take normal sized actors and shrink them down to hobbit or dwarf size and make it look utterly convincing the bane of earlier fantasy films such as willow was their inability to portray realistic little people one technique called forced perspective has been around at least since the s but peter came up with an interesting new twist in the sections on adapting the books into the screenplays they do an excellent job of explaining why they felt it necessary to depart from the books in some places up to and including dropping whole sections such as the scouring of the shire one major issue they had to deal with was how to introduce arwen who basically in the books just shows up for her wedding with aragorn and we have no idea who she is they went so far as to try to portray her as a sort of warrior princess at helms deep but then thankfully hit upon the idea of using flashbacks instead by far the best documentaries in my opinion are those which deal with gollum i can remember sitting in the theater at the start of the return of the king watching as gollum hid under the mountains we even forgot our own name and thinking to myself i wonder if andy serkis really liked having his eyelashes plucked out seeing how it didnt look like he had any only then did it occur to me that i was looking at a computer generated character it was so utterly convincing that i completely forgot now thats movie magic in the documentaries we learn how andy serkis was initially brought in just to do the voice of gollum and to interact with sam and frodo in practice sessions before they would proceed to do the actual shoot talking to thin air it didnt take peter very long to figure out that it just looked better with andy present in post production they painted him over with the animated character also his facial expressions as he said his lines were absolutely priceless they actually redesigned gollum to reflect this more accurately which is why the few glimpses we get of him in the fellowship of the ring dont look quite right several times the documentaries show a split screen with andy on one side speaking his lines and gollum on the other the resemblance is most startling its a shame andy didnt get an award for his performance but there wasnt any real category that could describe what he was doing was it acting voice acting something totally new another thing which i came to appreciate was that in undertaking such an enormous project spanning up to eight years it really has to be fun peter jackson made it fun he has a wonderful sense of humor he gave everyone free artistic rein checking in on them from time to time to make sure everything was in line they came to feel like family forget joining the circus when i grow up i want to work for a digital effects company well now that ive been through the extras im probably due to actually watch the movies again with an artists eye to how it was done then ill probably go through the extras once more i can truthfully say that this is by far the greatest dvd production ive ever seen i can only hope that peter eventually gets permission to film the hobbit the middle earth saga will not be complete without it and its impossible to imagine any other director doing it justice a final note another thing which really strikes me about peter jackson is his compassion case in point the inclusion of a special memorial documentary called cameron duncan the inspiration for into the west this tells the story of a very talented young man whom peter and indeed many of those working on the lord of the rings befriended cameron showed great promise as a filmmaker but sadly succumbed to cancer one concern he expressed near the end was his fear of being forgotten to paraphrase peter hes on the dvd he will not be forgotten 
much has been made of the green tint present on this version of the fellowship of the ring absent from the other two films while i can confirm its presence in the most current upc of this product i can say that its not a huge deal unless youre totally incompetent with your home theater setup its not nearly as bad as some have been making it out to be and with some of the screenshots ive seen its apparent that image enhancement settings have first been applied to the picture enlarging the problem now that this is out of the way here are the most common questions ive seen asked about this set does this include the same special features as the theatrical versions no if you want those special features you need to buy the multi disc theatrical version s likewise it does not include the theatrical cuts of the films which may especially worth having if your eyes are sensitive to the newly added green tint of the first film does it include the special features in hd no does it include all of the special features from the extended dvd sets yes it also includes the documentaries made for the limited edition sets which is lovely for completionists like me who missed out on one or more of the limited edition dvd sets it would be nice to be getting the documentaries in full hd on blu ray discs but it doesnt matter much for behind the scenes material such as this image galleries and the likes on the other hand would be nicely upgraded i suspect theyre saving any upgrades for the next release of lotr that peter jackson keeps talking about being released sometime after the hobbit movies are complete that understood this is one of the best blu ray releases of this generation even if of the discs are dvds oh and for those of you who wanted the entire movie on one blu ray disc i think youre missing the point of the format you need a good bit rate for the best image and audio quality if youre obsessed with the concept watching a hour plus movie in one sitting you can buy a digital copy that way you wont have to get off the couch and switch discs heaven forbid what do these complainers do when they have to pee pull out a water bottle 
if youre looking for a detailed synopsis theres many informative reviews on this site whichll help you im commenting from the perspective of someone who was completely out of the lotr loop i figured my interest would be lukewarm at best so i missed the theatrical versions avoided the dvds for some time until a friend urged me to watch his copies of the extended editions he purposely left all three sets on my coffee table the intention being of course to motivate me into watching em and my coffee table was where they sat for several weeks one rainy afternoon i finally relented and after sitting through all hours over the course of two days i must admit i was quite humbled by the experience no way did i expect to be blown away and yet thats exactly what happened i got so caught up in it i had to remind myself i was watching a fantasy and not a historical re enactment anyway my point is that you dont have to be the proverbial fanboy to enjoy this trilogy this is essential viewing for any self respecting movie fan and deserves all the praise it gets most notably for sean astins performance remarkable particularily in return of the king a slam dunk star purchase if the extended editions seem too pricey for a blind buy just rent fellowship of the ring for starters and shortly afterward you might find yourself saving up for the entire trilogy 
back early in the decade peter jackson released the extended editions wich were supposed to be the definitive lord of the rings dvds now in we get the limited editions sounds pretty snazzy you dont get much for your money in fact you getless anyone who has an exccelent surround sound system shouldavoid these at all costs the extended editions have dts exsound wich is the only way to watch the best picturewinner return of the king or the others for that matter if youjust have normal television sound these are great it gives youa few documentarys woopie the only reason i gave these starswere for the films themselves wich are the best fantasy filmsof all time hands down period as far as the set it gets one starbecause its just a waste of time and money when there are betterversions already out there just get the extended editions 
this trilogy ranks very high with me as far as movies go it really is an epic on film made from an epic novel if you just want to watch the movie to see if you like it this might or might not be a good purchase for you there are many options for just watching the movie itself including renting it or purchasing the two disc versions the movie itself is phenomenal on so many levels and any negatives are overshadowed by the sheer magnitude of the plus sides of this but if you already know you want to own the trilogy on dvd i encourage you to buy this set or the individual platinum editions in addition to the movie presented in widescreen format as it was intended you get much more the lotr buff and the movie buff can absorb so much about these films with the extras included on the four discs per movie first if youve only seen the theatrical release be ready for many many minutes of additional footage in the film this isnt a deleted scenes section this includes completely new scenes and extended scenes that were left out in the theatre so your bladder didnt burst while watching for four hours these scenes do clarify some things but mostly they just add to experience as a whole second you have multiple commentary tracks from actors writers directors etc way more than your typical dvd and lots of how why did they do that questions are answered third lots of featurettes on how the movies were made from writing the script to editing to special effects to casting to you name it each movie comes with extras like these easter eggs with each movie too from the packaging to the extras to the movie itself you can tell that peter jackson and company put a lot of time and effort into this set for themselves and for us the fans i really dont think youll be disappointed with this set as a whole i feel like there is always something for me to watch in there when i am in the mood for middle earth 
i was really worried when i read comments about a green tint to the fellowship of the ring for this box set i even saw some videos and photos online that show the difference between the extended blu ray edition vs the theatrical blu ray edition so you know what im talking about just watch this short video clip of the color difference between the two go to youtube and type in lotr green cast comparison and it should come up as the first video so after watching that video clip i finally got this in the mail today and popped in the fellowship of the ring to see if its as bad as the video made it out to be while there is a slight color change it is not nearly as bad as what the clip shows on youtube perhaps its my tv settings but all the colors are what they are supposed to be the sky is blue gandalf the grey is grey meaning his clothes white is white etc again there is a slight change but if anything all i really notice is that it is darker which isnt a big problem to me in fact id say it looks better than it originally did so dont be scared if you are like me and watched any videos of the color difference or saw any photos they are exaggerated as for the box set itself it is extremely nice its not like other box sets such as avatar where its a pain to get the movies out whenever you want to watch a movie with this box set it is held with a magnet and easily pops right open whenever you want to pull out one of the movies i give them a lot of credit for coming up with a box set that easily allows you to access the movies it seems like such a little thing to some but for me thats a big issue when you have a flimsy box set that you have to struggle to get open every time so they did a great job with this one this is the best box set i have ever owned i like the fact that you can easily take the blu ray logo off the top making your box set look even nicer the front of the box has the title embossed and the ring itself is also slightly embossed the blu ray cases inside are black for the us version and blue for the uk version i live in the us so i got black i prefer the black but thats just an opinion people have been complaining about the movies being on seperate discs each so each movie is split into part and part what people need to realize and ive read up on this with several sources to back up this statement is that if they put each movie on a single disc the quality would have been reduced which basically kills the entire point of blu ray so they are doing us a favor they are giving us the highest quality they can by splitting the movies up onto discs besides lets not be lazy by having to get up once during the movie to change the disc i understand that people dont like interuptions during their movies but how long does it take to change a disc seconds a minute at most i just dont feel its as big of an issue as many people have made it out to be if better quality means i have to get off my butt for a minute to switch discs then ill take it no problem overall its a beautiful box set for any lotr fan and it looks great on your shelf i highly recommend buying it it is well worth it oh and one last thing do not pay over for it you can get it right here on amazon for and i even saw some on ebay for around the same price i was in best buy the other day just to see the price tag on it its at best buy and its also at borders dont waste your money there get it at amazon and save yourself with free shipping 
peter jacksons interpretation of the lotr books in my opinion are the greatest fantasy films ever made not just sword n sorcery fantasy but sci fi fantasy also yes its better than the original star wars trilolgy blasphemy maybe oh well on to it fellowship of the ring this is still my favorite of the films it didnt really have any problems in the theatrical version and the extended scenes only add to it it doesnt drag nothing seems out of place the special effects are all up to par and its just an amazing movie it has a really dreamy look to it and its a very magical movie lots of stuff with the hobbits and other odd beings such as elves there are scenes of the world of man but just glimpes this movie really has its head in the clouds great performances by ian mckellen christopher lee and sean bean really add to the film just about perfect out of the two towers this is my least favorite of the three films now the extended cut is much better than the theatrical cut the theatrical cut seemed really rushed like it didnt have enough time to tell what it had to tell it had an odd pace and things just seemed like a summary i was pretty let down when i saw it in the theater although i couldnt deny that it was a really good film just not in the same territory as fotr the extended cut really smoothes out the film and adds a lot of character stuff and good bits of comedy i do have my qualms with it though i have really never liked how gimli became comic relief in this movie but overall its tolerable well except for all the short jokes during the battle of helms deep nothing too bad though there is one scene that is added that is funny but just seems ridiculous its the soup giving scene its not long but i really wish it wasnt there other than that the movie still has problems it has a lot to do with the source material just doesnt translate to the most interesting film the hobbits are primarily traveling through the dirt through most of the film so that hurts it and it drags in a couple of spots even though it features talking trees excuse me ents this film feels just a tad bit too grounded the other two have more of a head in the clouds kind of feel to it this ones really down in the mud even with my problems with this film the ee is a really damn good movie its just not as interesting as the other two gollum adds a lot to the film also the special effects arent quite as good as the could have been either out of return of the king ah here we go this film was pretty amazing in the theater and the ee doesnt change that at all the special effects are wonderful the story is gripping and fast paced the character scenes are powerful and poignant and the war scenes are mind blowing i do have a couple of problems with this film so i guess not everything is perfect the ee has added about humorous scenes to the film which i did not like there is a drinking game at the beginning which is funny but its very crude gimli farting and talking about swimming with little hairy women yeah its funny but its out of place the worst addition has to be in the paths of the dead scene gimli does some seriously embarrassing slapstick which makes me wince every time i see it theres also a scene where aaragorn gimli and legolas attack some pirates which a bit too goofy for its own good and yes the ending is too long about minutes should have been shaven from it however its not so bad if you look at it as the ending of films instead of other than that the additions are quite good overall with a great scene at the beginning with saruman and numerous other character bits as the film goes on its quite wonderful over all out of all in all an amazing film these three films really fit together as one single story better than the theatrical cuts and definitely better than the te i have some qualms with some of the added footage in the second and third films but seriously were talking about minutes tops out of hours added footage and out of an hour epic not really much to complain about sam m 
i havent much interest in special features but these movies look beautiful in p ive seen plenty of pretty movies on blu ray including avatar but none come close to the beauty of the lord of the rings trilogy for those only familiar with the theatrical versions the extended editions are well worth the price in most movies deleted scenes are usually silly you can understand why they were deleted the added footage in lotr expands the story and gives some much needed development to some characters the most notable being boromir and faramir 
these movies are wonderful ok enough the movies themselves the reason these movies are released this way is because of market demographics there are a lot of people like me who are tired of the interactive dvd special editions that were the norm in the past what we are more interested in nowadays is what you get here instead of gobs of information disjointedly placed in a heirarchical menu system you have a linear presentation of the material that can be bookmarked for your favorite bits this practice is unfairly called double dipping but the fact of the matter is those of you who already have the original extended editions bought those because you at least thought that it was what you wanted if it is what you wanted you should be happy with them if its not what you wanted then get these discs im glad the trend now is more toward linear documentaries rather than indexed menu driven extras if you like feature length documentaries rather than hunt and peck extras this is for you 
its great to watch the lord of the rings in blu ray ive seen it a thousand times but seeing it on blu ray was like watching for the first time 
its the epic lord of the rings how could you give it less than stars i love the works of j r r tolkien and the movie adaptations were beautifully done the extended blu ray edition is awesome each movie is hours long at least the making of extras are packed and awesome one of the greatest box sets of all time if youre a huge fantasy fan also check out game of thrones 
if you are like me and only consider the extended versions of lord of the rings to be the actual movie then this is for you picture quality is amazing so glad they brought this out have been waiting for awhile definate must buy for a lotr fan 
the lord of the rings are three of the most cherished novels of all time along with the hobbit so i was absolutely stunned when new line cinema announced that they were going to make them into an epic movie trilogy for decades most tolkien fans believed that the lord of the rings could never ever be made into a movie for it was considered too long complex and grandiose to do justice to the books in such a limited and populous media as film but peter jackson the maverick kiwi filmmaker who pushed to have the films made has proven the doubters wrong for he has indeed made a film trilogy that is relatively faithful to j r r tolkiens enduring romantic and sweeping fantasy masterpieces as books that have defined the fantasy genre almost as a whole they have never been equalled or surpassed in depth of vision or descriptive eloquence the adventures trials and tribulations of the halflings frodo baggins sam gamgee merry and pippin have inspired generations of people and the lord of the rings has consistently been voted as one of the most popular novels of all time by readers in polls around the world so when the films were being made in new zealand of all places i avidly followed their progress on the lord of the rings official motion picture website looking at it almost daily i dont think i have ever been as excited about the production of a film as with the lord of the rings and i waited with baited breath for the day i could finally go and see the first big screen adaptation at my local cinema peter jackson was an unlikely person to make these high fantasy novels into films having made b grade shlock horrors for most of his early career but on reflection he has proved his salt as a highly talented movie director with flying colours his choice to make the films in his homeland of new zealand was brave and daring being so distant and isolated from the major centres of film production one of his best decisions was to hire the fantasy illustrators alan lee and john howe as conceptual artists for these two men have defined how the works of tolkien should look more than almost any other illustrator they gave to the film an aesthetic and literary credibility that i think it would not have otherwise had mr jackson is indeed a wise man two strokes of genius when it came to the choice of casting was elijah wood as the sensitive frodo baggins and brad dourif as the conniving wormtounge for if i had been making the films i would have certainly chosen these actors too as for the character of gandalf ian mckellen plays him with dignified wit and grace and the noble and reserved character of aragorn is perfect for vigo mortensen and christopher lee plays the malevolent character of saruman with relish as one would expect from one of hammer horrors arch villains orlando bloom is graceful as the elfin character of legolas and john rhys davies as gimli the dwarf is stalwart and funny the three lead female characters played by miranda otto as eowyn liv tyler as arwen and kate blanchett as galadriel are all strong and beautiful if not a bit two dimensional but then tolkien himself was not very good at writing female characters anyway the voice acting and motion capture of the performance of andy serkis as the tortured gollum or smeagol is amazing to say the least i mean his character seems so very real there are too many other talented actors in this film to mention here but nearly every one of them were well chosen to play their respective roles in these breathtaking movies the special effects are extraordinary and believable with some revolutionary cgi that had never been tried or tested before and when it comes to the all important music the beautiful moving and haunting scores by the canadian film composer howard shore are truly memorable and only serve to enhance the viewing experience these three groundbreaking movies have set a new standard for fantastic cinema that many feel will be almost impossible to outdo the first film in the trilogy the fellowship of the ring follows the hobbits as they first set out on their perilous quest to destroy the one ring and is quite faithful to the novel and although it does omit their fortunate meeting with tom bombadil and their narrow escape from the creepy barrow wights is exceptionally enjoyable and most enchanting i also think it proved to the fans and the viewing public in general the validity of making the lord of the rings into a motion picture trilogy and artfully set the stage for the next two films to be screened over the following two christmas holidays i give this first film five out of five stars the second film in the trilogy the two towers is to me less successful for peter jackson and fran walsh made some drastic changes to the arc of the original story that in the end really dont make much thematic sense for instance the elves arriving at helms deep to the desperate aid of our heroes in their battle against the rampaging orcish army does not happen in the book at all and the wargs certainly dont appear in the lord of the rings as they did in the hobbit and certainly dont look like rabid hyenas but large wolves though i do have a couple of other very minor criticisms of this film the two mentioned above are the chief niggles i have so while this bridging film is perhaps for me the least successful movie in the trilogy it is still marvelously entertaining to watch i give this second film three out of five stars the third film in the trilogy the return of the king is to say the least magnificent for it is produced on a truly epic scale and like the first film is relatively faithful to the original novel in this film frodo and sam journey into the heart of darkness mordor after a long exhausting and dangerous journey through the ancient lands of middle earth and since the fellowship has disbanded they are alone and extremely vulnerable as a conclusion to the trilogy it beautifully ties all the loose strands together and one could not ask for a more brilliant ending the return of the king is alot moodier darker and more tragic in tone than the first two films being of course an ending to all things but also a beginning i give this third film five out of five stars i do understand that when making such a voluminous novel into a film on cannot include each and every character or all that passes for one has to make hard decisions about what to append what to omit and what to alter taken as a whole these films are an exhilarating and majestic cinematic experience that have to be seen again and again to be fully appreciated the lord of the rings the motion picture trilogy is cinema on a mind bogglingly epic scale that will wow its many viewers with its mythic overtones and moving storyline and will unquestionably stand the test of time it is a damn shame that peter jackson has declined the opportunity to direct the hobbit due to personal issues with new line cinema for in reality he is the only man for the job if he had then it and the lord of the rings would have formed an aesthetically cohesive and thematically unified whole but one can always live in hope when purchasing the films i suggest that you buy the special extended editions as they include hours worth of extra footage that was cut from the cinema release versions that give one a more satisfyingly complete story the special features extend over six discs with two for each film thus making twelve discs in whole these features will literally give you many hours worth of enthralling entertainment info and perhaps a deeper appreciation of the film making process so if you havent yet read the lord of the rings hopefully these wondrous films will inspire you to pick up a copy of j r r tolkiens timeless literary masterpiece and start exploring the world of middle earth in more depth i promise that youll completely enjoy the experience happy reading 
o k ive been reading all the reviews most very supportive some unfavorable to those of you who love this triology i stand fast with you to those of you who have done nothing but nitpick have little to credit all the hard work that went into the making of this movie plus your laments about how long the movies were i say this to you heres a classic that peter jackson took on only because he loved the tolkien books so much for fifty years noone produced anything memorable regarding the lord of the rings why because noone had the vision and fortitude that peter jackson had or the good fortune to have artists like alan lee john howe and the weta workshop to bring to life the characters in this trilogy the musical score composed by howard shore was stunning and exceptional presently there are concerts being given around the world that are featuring the music of lotr middle earth along with ensambles of choirs soloists and musicians i recently attended one such concert in baltimore and when it was finished there wasnt anyone sitting all were on their feet giving those talented people a standing ovation the actors in their respective parts were well chosen and very believable hard work by everyone and hard won and guess what academy awards were bestowed on this group of dedicated people so to those of you who find yourselves in the catogory of nit pickers whiners and one to two stars minded i give you this advice go soak your heads open your small slitted eyes and clean out your ears so as to be able to appreciate some of the finer efforts of people who cared enough to bring you the very best of what was possible for such a classic as this trilogy is as peter jackson mentioned when hitting the red carpet on academy awards night the have landed yes peter millons myself included are sure glad you did we have a visual and audio classic we can pass down to our own children and i am sure wherever j r r tolkien may be that he too is smiling and thinking exactly exactly what i had in mind 
i am no film maven i dont pay particular attention to technical aspects of film making because i cant be bothered to be that lofty all i know is how a movie makes me feel i am an avid reader always have been but for some reason i was never able to get through these books they just didnt hold my attention i loved the stories and i loved the characters but the writing was always just a bit too much work for me in the films i feel that peter jackson has created a brilliant constellation of the lore magick and beauty of middle earth and the lord of the rings trilogy without taking himself too seriously in order to please the tolkien savants who would never be happy with any film version or the film snobs who will damn you if you do and damn you if you dont just what people choose to criticize is what strikes me as so strange some expert below stated that he couldnt relate to any of the characters this i simply dont understand who couldnt feel frodos pain at the death of gandalf or feel a lump in their throat at sams devotion to his charge or smile at the friendly rivalry between gimli and legolas and for gods sake who on earth could argue that the king his queen and all their subjects bowing before the hobbits wasnt one of the most powerful cinematic moments in recent memory i just dont get it are these peoples heads up their behinds for the warmth many reviewers declared the films illegitimate due to the fact that everything was computer generated they must have totally ignored the dvd sets extensive documentaries something i usually do but didnt in this case detailing jacksons use of scale models and matte paintings staples of old fashioned filmmaking i suppose its always tempting to shoot down things that are popular after all its a lot easier to tear a house down than to build one all i can say is that im getting old and ive probably gained a little perspective on whats important and heres a hint its not whether the director chose to use too much cgi or that the phial of galadriel was too big and poncey or that the tree ents came into the story a little too early but i suppose on a website where critics declare that judy garland was too fat in the wizard of oz you just have to expect a few gargamels 
the cases the outer box is absolutely beautiful sturdy enough the individual cases fit snugly inside it they hold the discs pretty firmly and the included pamphlet is a pretty good guide to the special features special features the same as the previous extended editions there are a lot of great interviews documentaries they are well worth watching extended edition for those who dont know the scenes are placed in their original position in the films no menu under special features though they lengthen an already lengthy trio of films they are definitely worth it i especially love the scene about aragorns mother it highlights aragorns role as elessar hope which was glossed over in the theatrical versions there is no drop off in quality for these scenes the bottom line this is the best release you can purchase the blu ray means the best quality video you can get you get the most extensive collection of special features released you could purchase them separately but you save money getting the set and a little bit of space on your dvd shelf i havent checked out the digital copy yet but i am glad to have it the digital copy is only standard quality i believe not hd 
this set is the complete lord of the rings trilogy extended editions on blu ray things to keep in mind all bonus content is on dvd and in standard definitionfellowship of the rings has a decided greenish tint on this setfellowship of the rings is remastered and does not use the blu ray theatrical editions messed up videooverall this blu ray set will be exactly what fans expect and what they want audio quality is jaw dropping on the movies proper video quality minus the green tint present faintly on my setup on fellowship of the rings is something you will drop into your player to show of the capabilities of a proper hd presentation the movies themselves are fantastically told stories and remain mostly true to the original novel if you like medieval action and adventure this is definitely something that should be on your wish list 
heres an idea how about adding a mail in coupon to the return of the king extended versions for those of us who already purchased them seperately this coupon would enable us to acquire the cool little slip case sos we can keep them all together like this set something for the true fan who couldnt wait the three years to watch and own the seperate extended dvds any one agree with me hey great star trilogy though it would have been nice to have filmed the scouring of the shire as a bonus appendage on the dvd but that is my one and only complaint king kong who cares lets get on to filming the hobbit before ian mckellen gets too old any more agreements there 
when these extended boxed sets of dvds were released i purchased a boxed set for our home only and one boxed set for each of my young to adult children since that original purchase i have had several all day long lord of the rings parties some which had only people present counting me and others where we had or more people each time i watch it i am still enthralled by the story and the many brave selfless peoples who inhabit that beautiful world this is a series for the ages and i suspect that my children will do what ive been doing and will pass these dvds down to their children this series is a treasure for all to watch and shows how love friendship and faith can and will overcome evil no matter how hard the battle or how wicked and evil the adversary may be im thinking about purchasing when i can afford to a few more sets for gifts and keeping a couple of new sets stashed away for future grandchildren 
this is a must have for all lord of the rings fans well worth the money need i say more 
i am a female over and i love to watch all movies there is so much bravery and i love the fight scenes there is no nudity or foul language the movie just is an inspiration for good to conquer all i really dont know how peter jackson pulled these great movies off they are truly a masterpiece i especially like the elves at helms deep 
dont waste your time buying one or two of these movies at a time splurge and get all best versions thats it youre done 
excuse me the above product alert states a release date for or according to the mayan calendar the world ends in that will be too late for us to enjoy the extended versions we want those extended versions released now so we can have at least two years to enjoy them before we are all obliterated from the earth quit playing cash cow with our sparse money we are in a bleedin recession dont you know 
my only complaint with this set is that it has all of its special features in regular standard def format it would have been nice to have full hd extras 
lotr is without a doubt the best trilogy ever created each movie fotr ttt rotk are excellent on their own and as a united piece are unstoppable none of the movies have major faults like bad acting or ewoks or crappy plot but stand on their own as amazing features really meant to be watched as one very long epic the lord of the rings is the best thing to ever happen to cinema no more hollywood garbage but instead passionate filmmaking from both cast and crew the eternal themes of jrr tolkien are fleshed out and as opposed to other recent trilogies the amazing special effects which garnered three academy awards do not distract from the storytelling but augment it peter jackson and his crew spent seven years doing a phenomenal job bringing to life the unimaginable the casting was perfect the ensemble shines on screen ian mckellen and viggo mortensen are particularly magnificent sean astin does a superb job throughout the trilogy going from sidekick to heartfelt hero in the final installment elijay wood does an exceptional job portraying a peaceful happy hobbit descending into madness ultimately ending up in a conflicted state where his former peace is gone there is a reason why all three of these movies are in imdb coms top films of all time no sane person would want to miss out on the movie adventure of our time 
the extended editions of lord of the rings are such a triumph of commitment to artistry such a labor of love that there really is no reason to release lord of the rings in a new format if you cant have the extended editions of the films in the blu ray format it would be exceedingly easy for them to provide the option to watch the film as the extended edition or the original theatrical release they actually could have done that for the dvd releases really but that would have prevented new lines first double dip attempt fool us once fine but not again accept nothing less than the extended editions people 
the lord of the rings extended editions blu ray set is absolutely incredible i usually tend to ignore the special features and extras included in most dvd or blu ray releases but this case is entirely different the extra documentaries and other content included with the films are almost as entertaining as the films themselves considering these films were a monumental undertaking probably one of the biggest film productions ever attempted it is definitely worth taking a glance at the extra content included you wont be disappointed the three extended editions of the films are stunning as most of us already know the blu ray transfer looks immaculate some users did report there being a tint issue green tint with the first film i didnt notice anything wrong with the tint it seemed fine to me other than that potential issue this film trilogy is about as perfect as any film trilogy can hope to be its better than star wars 
the lord of the rings directed by peter jackson touches on so many themes that books can be written on this trilogy i will just touch on a few messages that are relevant to us in the obvious theme is the battle between low principles of oppression and hierarchy based on physical strength versus the principles of magic and unity this trilogy shows dark lords and wizards of light battling with teams of beings on each side you never know who is going to fight for which side at any given time those on the team of the dark lords struggle against the savagery of each other and the team of light struggle against sinking into a state of lowliness another battle is that of nature versus machines we are asking ourselves today how much technology is too much the movie presents a clear winner in our situation the winner is not so certain even though our existence is at stake the greatest theme in lord of the rings is the battle for the king to rise to his proper place in his blood line and destiny 
ah lord of the rings where do i begin without spending hours typing i have been a tolkien fan since i was about years old i played the interplay rpg for the pc watched the animated movie of the hobbit and my dad read me the hobbit and fellowship of the ring as bedtime stories however i picked up fellowship and ended up finishing it on my own just because it was so long the entire lord of the rings novel series with the hobbit are my favorite books of all time next to the holy bible so needless to say i had very high expectations for peter jacksons movie trilogy and it met all of them and then he and newline came out with the extended trilogy which went beyond my expectations i got each of these movies when they first came out and i still have not watched all the bonus features this set has a special place of honor in my video library and even as dvd is gradually replaced by blu ray i suspect that i shall continue to cherish this set it is the most cram packed dvd set ive ever seen and anyone with a love of fantasy sci fi adventure and good film making and literature in general needs this in their collection i eagerly await the high definition versions of this film on blu ray but even this dvd set is still the ideal centerpiece to any movie collection 
im not going to bother with the story many have done better than i would i doubt anyone still needs it explained this review is on the quality of the blu ray i owned the extended cuts on dvd and it was great the blu ray is so clear i can see details i never noticed before the colors are so vivid and i can almost see every blade of grass in the wide shots the sound is great although it seems a bit more biased towards the front not as surround as id expect but that doesnt detract much from the experience at all the night scenes arent muddy at all i can see all the details on the ring wraiths beautifully ive read the book times and dont know how many times ive watched the dvds the blu ray clarity makes it so realistic i find myself reacting to the drama almost as much as i did the first time in the theater the special features are pretty much exactly what was in the dvd set and theyre still on dvds so that wont be any different but ive never been a huge extras guy it would have been nice to have them transferred to hd though watch this on the biggest tv you can sit closer if you have to the dvds are great but until you see it in hd youve only seen part of it 
i held off on purchasing the blu ray extended versions of these films even though i had been waiting since the announcement of blu ray technology for its release this is one of my favorite film series and i have owned the extended dvds since their release dates but since i upgraded my tv the dvds are just too pixilated and grainy detracting from its viewing but when i heard all the fuss about the green tint during the fellowship movie i was content to hold off on purchasing the extended versions until they fixed it but that was in vain there will be no fix but recently best buy had this set on sale for and i decided it was worth the risk for that amount of money and i have to say it is not nearly as bad as some make it out to be yes the problem is noticeable during some segments of the film but not such that it is overpowering in fact if you werent aware of the problem beforehand you probably wouldnt even notice it the other two movies are fine the quality of all the movies is exceptional even for amazons current price of around it is still a good deal i would definitely not pay more than that though 
buy the extended version the extended edition is much better than the regular version much the original version in movie theaters was hacked down in size because of fear that the length would be too much for some people the description says that the length blu ray extended edition will be the same as extended edition dvd yeh this should have been released from the start buy the extended version 
it is tough to even know where to start with this one as an avid and multiple reader of the trilogy i came to the trilogy with much baggage and impossibly high expectations now any rational person would know that there is no way to put the trilogy on the screen as written so i purposed to examine what the trilogy means to me and how i could adjust my expectations realistically to the media i decided that for my own taste what was needed was an adaptation that was faithful to the primary timeline and events to the core characters but overall it had to capture the sense of fate faith responsibility friendship and the frailty of life to my utmost delight peter jackson and co succeeded far beyond my expectations i think even had i not taken the time to think about it in advance i would still have been thrilled with what i saw what struck me the most was how especially at the end how i felt precisely the same sense of satisfaction at the result sadness at it actually ending and the bittersweet joy of the final journey into the west that i feel whenever ive completed a reading of the books these movies are phenomenal in the way they secure the emotional dynamic of the books and there are some truly beautiful moments in the movies that are in a way only possible in the cinema denethor asking pippin to sing never stood out to me until that stunning moment when billy boyd began to sing as faramir begins his fateful assault on osgiliath i literally had the hair on my neck and arms stand up or gandalf explaining to pippin what its like to die and pass over to the other side moments all that could be written but could not match the power of the visual event the extended dvd versions are definitely the way to go for home viewing though again it still isnt the book but the additional footage secures more connections and brings the vision even closer to the imagination of reading the extras are delightful especially as something to put on just to have something on youll find yourself stopping whatever other activity youre about to watch this segment or that the most incredible part of the extras is the story of the inspiration behind the song into the west regarding the young filmmaker facing terminal illness if this doesnt move you to tears you have no heart beating within you now of course all of this comes from a person who loves the books and wanted very much to love the movie but anecdotally my wife was never a fan of the books found fellowship of the ring a little boring and quite simply not her style when the third dvd came out some friends of mine and i planned a viewing party we bought lots of food got a huge widescreen tv and had a ten hour party to view the entire theater releases trilogy at once she didnt want to come over right away just figuring shed join later to see some of our friends she arrived minutes into fellowship and sat down on the couch and was riveted to the television to the very end after the party when we arrived home she sat right down and popped the fellowship dvd in to see the part she missed she loved it and still talks about how wonderful the movies were as an aside we friends hadnt planned on actually just sitting and watching we had games and other little activities to break up hours of viewing they all went untouched it is often mentioned how the three hours of each movie just flew by ill tell you that to hours also fly right by as long as you have food nearby this is one of the most important cinematic events in the history of moviemaking it may not be citizen kane on the waterfront or pulp fiction but it is an accomplishment that will probably remain unparelleled in cinema for years to come 
i ordered this on the black friday deals and what do you know the price is still a low as of this writing this is an absolute steal at the current price and should not be passed up i waited until now to post a review as i hadnt had time to watch all three movies until new years weekend and what a rewarding weekend it was while the theatrical editions are good on bluray the remastering of the audio and the new color timing especially on the fellowship of the ring is so much better on this extended edition collection there are almost no more superlatives left in the english language with which to describe it these films are such classic and well executed cinematic storytelling that you can hardly improve upon them and this extended edition of all three films really deepens the story over the theatrical edition to the point where some rushed sections become much clearer and some motivations of characters are better explained these films will probably never look better even in a theater unless you are viewing an k scan from the original negatives in a well maintained digital cinema some viewers have complained of a cyan hue saturating the entire fellowship of the ring that is not accurate in the new color timing supervised by peter jackson and andrew lesnie themselves certain scenes got a little bluer note the pass of carathras section as an example but what i noticed was that certain scenes were really warmed up with more prominent skin tones and oranger firelight as well as the deepening of certain shadows note the moria sequences and the fight on weathertop the fuzziness that seemed to plague a good bit of the theatrical bluray of fellowship is entirely gone here with incredible detail visible in nearly every scene the new color timing and remastering is so gorgeous that visually fellowship really contends with the two towers as my favorite of the three films the uncompressed dts master audio soundtrack on all three movies is so much better than any of the previous dvd releases and even noticeably better than the theatrical blurays all the dialog was crystal clear even amidst the blaring battle scenes or the roar of destruction that occurs toward the end of return of the king the surrounds seemed even more active with some ambient sounds even as subtle as birds chirping coming through clearer than i can remember in previous viewings in other formats the soundstage is so immersive during the action sequences with sword strikes and hoofs pounding coming from all around the viewer not to mention the stirring and often heart rending score by howard shore ever since these movies came out hollywood has been trying to recapture this lightning in a bottle that the skill and artistry and loving care that peter jackson harnessed to create this masterpiece even avatar one of the most visually beautiful movies i have ever seen cannot hold a candle to this suite of films i dare say it will be a couple more decades until any filmmaker can unite storytelling heart and visual spectacle in such an astonishingly effective fashion as peter jackson did in the lord of the rings this is timeless storytelling and filmmaking if you love movies not just the lord of the rings you must add this to your collection and if you do as we do in my household watch them once a year and engage in frodos quest and the fellowships struggle again and again 
i bought this on a whim for my husband and son little did i know that it was going to turn them into huge lotr fans they absolutely love the movies and cant stop making references to hobbits and nazguls throughout the day a great purchase the movies were crystal clear too 
crystal clear you can see every little detail from gimlis beard to every nasty detail of an orcs face it was better than when we saw it in theaters highly recommend 
if you love tolkiens middle earth you will love these dvds if there was one thing i could change about the extended dvds they would be longer if you wished you could have more about the hobbits or elves you really wont be dissapointed with these dvds fire up the dvd player and buy the extended movies 
i just cancelled the theatrical version of lord of the rings which i have had on order for almost a year when i learned that april was the target date of the release of just the theatrical version i cancelled my order and will wait one or even two years more for the extended version of the lord of the rings in blu ray as i have too many versions already i appreciate those reviewers who wrote the conditions of this newest release maybe as buyers we are getting smarter who knows 
movies stars transfers starsfans unhappy that the extended edition of the lord of the rings can finally rejoice the extended edition has finally arrived on blu ray with a brand spanking new transfers that look exceptional for the most part be aware however that this edition looks slightly different than the previous dvds there is a heavier greenish tinge in the shire and teal hue during aragorn and the hobbits hike at the beginning fans who wanted both theatrical and extended editions on a single seamlessly branching blu ray disc or discs will be disappointed as youll have to keep your theatrical blu rays if you purchased them to have both over all the three films benefit from the newer transfer with a sharper better defined transfer although the quality improves with each successive film there isnt some of the excessive use of digital noise reduction that was more of an issue with the theatrical edition of the film on blu ray the films are spread over six blu ray discs and the special features are presented on dvds essentially repurposed from the original sets reportedly this was at the direction of the filmmaker peter jackson but it is a bit of an odd choice given that its a bit inconsistent throughout the film skin tones are on the pink side vs the reddish hue of the theatrical cuts that were released on blu ray audio sounds marvelous with one of the best audio lossless transfers ive heard recently its remarkably detailed and has tremendous presence that will give your subwoofer a work out the packaging is nicely done with a hard cardboard case the door of which folds out revealing a map of middle earth each film is housed in its own blu ray case the films are broken up over two discs due to the size of the files and to provide maximum image quality could each film have been put on a single disc yep but it would have subtracted from the image quality and considerable compression would have to have been done for me its not big deal and provides a nice intermission the special features are as before for the most part with the commentary tracks etc ported over from the previous edition the only thing new here is the inclusion of costa botes documentaries from the original theatrical extended limited edition this is an exceptional set could it have been better sure but im personally happy that the extended editions have finally arrived on blu ray even if it isnt the ultimate set that everyone wanted thatll be after the hobbit arrives on blu ray no doubt highly recommended 
important update some people reported that the second disk of fotr wont play disk s software apparently looks in memory for settings carried over from disk such as which commentary was selected no memory no settings so loading fails bad design i suggested inserting a memory card one person responded that switching from internal memory to usb memory did the trick you might want to experiment i got the set tuesday im generally impressed and feel intolerably smug about having patiently waited for the extended edition bds especially considering the near giveaway price less than per disk the packaging is excellent three bd cases in a sturdy outer box with a magnetic flap cover getting to the movie and disk you want is a fumble free snap all three movies have the correct disks as far as the labeling goes i have no problem with spreading each film across two disks as the break was perfectly chosen for fellowship and well chosen for the other films and as in my dotage my attention span grows increasingly shorter theres been discussion in blu ray groups about the transfer which does not always have the same color balance as the theatrical bds i refer you to them my only complaint is that throughout the films flesh highlights are sometimes burned out but this might be intentional there have also been complaints about a greenish tint eg arwens dress at her first appearance i dont see it and suspect its due to miscalibration which is common on the other hand note how when wormtongue is talking to th eacute oden his face is ever so faintly green while the kings is a decrepit pink i hadnt seen this before until now the searchers and have been my blu ray reference disks the return of the king joins them and even arguably replaces them the image quality is exceptional the fellowship has a wonderful easter egg which you should have no trouble finding as its hidden in plain sight of an mtv trashing of the council scene its hysterically funny and definitely not for anyone under hint its about a new use for the one ring that would likely have pleased queen victoria though most of the supplemental material is on dvd its generally transferred well and scales nicely on my sony bdp s player it occasionally comes close to bd quality the sound format is dts ma why not or the sixth channel is a mono signal sent to the rear speakers it isnt often used but you can hear it when you shut off the other five channels the lfe is at a woofer and lease busting level at least db too high you might want to turn down the level before the movie starts then set it to taste the uncompressed audio provides a big improvement in sound quality and i find myself better liking howard shores music im of the school of thought that with respect to music less is more or at least that music should be used only where its effective too many films have almost continuous scoring which is not only irritating but emotionally distancing the music should not repeat what the actors show us that distancing might be an asset with shores score as it moves us farther from our familiar world and theres the possibility shore wanted to write a wagnerian epic complete with dozens of leitmotivs the subject matter essentially the same as wagners ring cycle cries out for it i have therefore decided that mr shore deserves the benefit of the doubt and will approach lotr as if it were an opera not a motion picture im nearly halfway through return and have no reason not to recommend this set im just wondering how long it will take to get through the supplemental material and that doesnt include the running commentaries of which there are four for each film england has always been wagner philic so its not surprising tolkiens story has obvious parallels with the ring cycle for example sm eacute agol kills a distant relative d eacute agol for possession of the one ring arwen gives up her immortality to be with aragorn eowyn gets siegfrieds most famous line and so on 
sure its not the extended editions but for what it costs it is worth the money i got them and there worth every penny 
excellent in so many areas i bought the extended blu ray lotr version at an amazon low price of ive never seen it cheaper than that around cyber monday acting direction costume pacing cinematography are all superb there are two blu ray discs supplied per trilogy part which does not bother me as i know the reasons why they did that it was a quality choice spreading the video data per episode over two blu ray discs gives the best quality possible picture the sound mix direct and surround is very clear the packaging is appealing the extended scenes improve the storytelling in certain parts of the movie i think the demise of saruman is much clearer and the relationship of eowyn and faramir are explained a lot better in the shorter version eowyn just seems to end up with faramir quickly after being broken hearted for aragorn and it didnt feel right to me in the longer version faramir doesnt look so much like a consolation prize for each eowyn sometimes the extended scenes add nothing and make the story drag a bit for instance the anonymous dumb hobbit who is picking his ear wax and flinging it as the voiceover explains the shire this is supposed to be funny and endearing local color but overall ill take the extra scenes and i bought this set for them and also to step up to the detail of blu ray as far as the extras extra discs that are not the movie im not so big on looking at all the companion video extras the making of videos etc ive seen some of them already and i personally dont want to know how the movie studio did the effects tricks shots and set design it ruins some of the magic of the movie for me in future viewings just my opinion other people can still get lost in the story after knowing how the illusions were made ymmv my only complaint i had heard for a long time about the supposed greenish cast well im here to say yes its here at times not total horrible but its here its used in alternation with what is sometimes called the blockbuster look a type of color timing color rendition applied in post production symptoms of it are a blue teal cast over certain scenes contrasted with highlights which quite often seem to be orangish gold for an example of what im talking about you can go to youtube and type in jurassic park blu ray side by side comparison p the skin tones on the hobbits they have a yellowish cast at times in broad daylight and no this is not because of campfire or sunset scenes basically it reminds me of a motion picture version of slightly underexposed ektachrome slide film this may be before the time of a lot of people here i notice that i rarely see a pure bright red in this film at least in episode which is what i have watched on extended lotr so far some of this can be the cinematographers choice too for the look of the movie overall i just dont remember it looking exactly this way in the theater am i going to ding this sets rating a star for this no i get lost in the story just the same is it a big deal no its a minor annoyance on a great storytelling while i personally think lotr extended blu ray would be better off with this toned down a bit oh well lotr is still a wonderful tale the story gets told and i fall into the story so will you 
being someone who skipped out on all the dvd release i am glad i did because this set gave me everything i wanted the movies all look great in blu ray and it is nice to get the extras even though the extra disc are all the same dvd disc from the dvd extended editions as for as this set goes i loved the way the box looks and how good the movies look on the tv so if you didnt buy lord of the rings at all like i did then just get this set and be done with it 
star wars is the story of a young man luke skywalker who in just one days time goes on an incredible and unbelievable adventure of a lifetime exploring the depths of outer space confronting terrible evil and prevailing against a machine designed for terror and destruction george lucas first star wars film a new hope is one of the best movies of all time but it is also one of the most unbelievable and succeeds at suspending ones disbelief as one example luke skywalker leaves his home planet on board the millennium falcon a space ship about the size of a basketball court while traveling through space the falcon provides its passengers with earth like gravity always keeping their feet firmly planted on the floor another example of how well star wars suspends disbelief revolves around the storys main plot line that a small manmade metal moon has been designed by the evil empire in order to keep control of all its imperial possessions through the threat of terrible force the empires death star moon is equipped with enough fire power to destroy a planet and early on in the movie it does fire a death ray that completely obliterates a whole planet the problem is that the death star is a moon if the empire wants to go destroy a planet it has to go hover over to some region of the galaxy where it can then fire its guns traveling at the speed of light it would take about years for someone on earth to reach the next closest solar system to our sun the death star does not travel at the speed of light it hovers if the death star hovered at a considerable rate of thousands of miles per hour that would still be only a tiny fraction of the speed of light when the falcon escapes the death star because the old man got the tractor beam out of commission the space ship blasts off into hyper space traveling a tremendous distance in a short amount of time to reach the rebel base then in hot pursuit comes the death star hovering after luke leia and han in the falcon that very same day the death star catches up to the falcon at the rebel base luke a farm boy from an insignificant corner of the universe is entrusted by the rebels and gets equipped with one of the alliances x wing fighters so that he can go destroy the death star before it destroys the rebel base and as the death star makes its final approach to the rebels planet the evil imperial lord darth vader says this will be a day long remembered we have seen the end of kenobi we shall soon see the end of the rebellion the key word is day this whole star wars adventure took place in just one day so the death star covered many millions or perhaps many billions of miles in a fraction of a day conquering this impossibility of reality is really what make star wars so great the plot features the triumph of good over evil the cinematography features the triumph of science fiction over physics review by adam platts
with george lucas becoming an overrated bloated egomaniac and completely sucking the life and adventure out of the once promising series the classic original trilogy is the only lucas road worth traveling watch these movies and compare them with the two recent prequels and you will see many differences in quality sure the new ones are amped up on sfx steroids but are missing the heart that the semi low budget a new hope had my favorite movie out of the trilogy would probably be the empire strikes back which completely destroys a new hope in my opinion i recently bought this trilogy and enjoyed watching it because it reminded me of when i was really small and i used to own all movies in their original packaging too bad they got sold at a lawn sale years ago oh yeah george if youre watching bring back chewbacca 
while its probably true that these films are not improved over their theatrical originals by the tweakings and additions george lucas has made including those done for the twentieth anniversary theatrical re release the changes are minor in comparison to the stunning beauty of these dvds their rich color and unprecedented sharpness of image forget vhs even if the real han does shoot first on your old tape ive seen star wars a gazillion times but the best time of all barring only the first time was watching these dvds maybe its true that a better dvd set is in the offing for or whenever but i was in though i became a small boy again for two hours that day in the theater who knows if ill live to grab them and enjoy them while you can 
i will try to keep this review terse long winded blow hard like me ha there is a night and day difference between this set and its counterpart yes it looks dated in spots yes the green screen effects occaisionally throw a glitch into the works and yes the non human characters look like puppets and costumes but the original releases are of a much higher caliber than the new ones maybe its just how old i am what i am used to but episodes iv through vi are just better movies period anakin skywalker is now in full darth vader mode drunk with power and his offspring leia and luke are leading an organization set on overthrowing his regime as with its precursor you must take the time to sit through all three installments to better grasp the story but each does hold up on its own again maybe its my age group but i think the outer space visuals are phenomenal and the scenery is more what i imagine a life friendly place to look like and having characters actually in front of the camera does hold a tactile sensation that the digital age seems to be bent on undoing but old meets new here as some segments of the older films are occaisionally given cgi treatments done sparingly it works beautifully done to excess it is just sterile it could have been helpful to use the advent of cgi to make the puppet characters facial expressions more life like they seemingly spared no expense in putting out the new and re issuing the old so why not but as i have said my bias leans heavily on this box instead of the other and sitting through all of it is like watching a movie that is almost hours long dont do this often or it will wear you down may the force be with you 
first i heart star wars i think ive bought every previously available edition second and in terms that i think you will grasp if this release doesnt include an excellent and pure remaster of unaltered original film footage i think youre going to find that one of the numerous people who have re cut the previous releases to make them more accurate and palatable will also rip these bds and do the same then as so often happens they will probably share the results with the world free of charge then the people who cant stand what youve unilaterally done to their childhood memories will go and download those results because its the only way to get a high quality transfer of what they really want in the process they will put zero nickels in your pocket on the other hand if you release bds that either contain just the original material or contain it as an additional disc i think youll find that most traditionalists will go against their better judgment and actually give you even more of their hard earned money just for the sake of having legitimate hardcopies as an aside see bartholomew boges review for excellent suggestions regarding the specifics of re mastering its your call george its not rocket science do you want more of my money or not 
i cant believe how much carrie fisher sounds like margot kidder nowadays anyway the original star wars trilogy sort of is finally on dvd yes these are the special editions sort of even more changes have been made here i consider myself a moderate star wars fan i enjoy the films and the video games and i still collect some of the action figures but i dont read all the books sleep on star wars sheets dress up like characters from the films or anything like that there was a time when i was younger that i wouldve been very much against the idea of altering these films but now that im older i feel that lucas should be able to for better or worse modify his films he would say complete them but i also think the originals should be available for those who fell in love with them back in the day anyway on to the films they look and sound great and most of the changes dont alter the films in a negative way i like the addition of the jabba scene in the original star wars and theyve improved the cgi to make him look more like he does in episode i unfortunately however greedo still shoots first in this version and even though its been improved a bit it still looks bad and still changes the story for the worse in my opinion this is my single least favorite change in the whole trilogy one other change that has some fans angry is the substitution of hayden christensen at the end of return of the jedi now instead of seeing the spirit of an older anakin we see young anakin looking kind of creepy no less though it would explain why old anakins body doesnt disappear when he dies if it was young anakin who became one with the force at any rate this is a great set and the bonus disc has among other things a great documentary on the making of the trilogy that will surprise a lot of long time fans i recommend this dvd set though hopefully someday the original versions of these films will be released for those who want them 
a long time ago in a galaxy far far away i was when i first saw this now famous opening card to what was then just star wars it had not yet been given an episode number or a subtitle it was simply star wars back in the summer of and george lucas was not sure and neither was th century fox whether his dream of a six chapter skywalker star wars saga would be realized after all this mixture of space adventure western war movie and old fashioned mythology was according to some studio executives a souped up comic book story with no chance of making money yet the adventures of farmboy turned into hero luke skywalker somehow defied the logic of skeptics and fuddy duddy critics and star wars went on to make movie history and billions in ticket sales and licensed products lucas went on to write the next two films stories and screenplays with the creative talents of the late leigh brackett and writer director lawrence kasdan to assist and with the success of star wars which by would be renamed as star wars episode iv a new hope to build up lucasfilm limited lfl into a huge multi media empire and even though it would be almost two decades before the prequels could be made and released the star wars trilogys completion in laid the groundwork for the creation of episodes one two and three this boxed set of the star wars trilogy consists of the special edition films these were released to celebrate the th anniversary of star wars which was a good promotional tool for lfl to build up fan enthusiasm for the still in production episode i the special edition re release featured not only a restored print of the film but also some deleted scenes mostly with jabba the hutt were incorporated into star wars a new hope mos eisley was practically reinvented digitally and some scenes were tweaked digitally pleasing some fans while annoying others the other two episodes the empire strikes back and return of the jedi were given less drastic retouches or at least there were fewer gripes about the changes there of course none of the elements that made the classic trilogy such a big part of our lives is missing in this special edition lukes earnest quest to be a jedi leias resolution to restore the democratic republic the droids laurel and hardy friendship hans casual courage chewies fierce loyalty obi wans quiet nobility yodas quirky teachings palpatines unremitting evil and darth vaders dark power are all there just as we aging teenagers of the star wars generation remember them industrial light magics then visionary effects have been cleaned up there are none of those unsightly mattes that are evident in home video transfers and john williams classic score still sounds fresh and timeless the star wars trilogy at least this is my impression is the movie series that has been most shamelessly re released and re packaged since the advent of videotape since four boxed sets original thx limited edition and re release have been launched like so many probe droids this latest video release has the fewest extra features of the last three the boxed set has no extra features while the thx version from opens each film with a short intro by george lucas and leonard maltin and the limited release comes with explanations of how and why the films were altered and or restored the boxed set only has a short promotional featurette about episode ii this boxed set comes in an easy to find pan and scan full screen format and a harder to find widescreen version until the dvd set comes out sometime in this boxed set is the best way to enjoy the original star wars films 
you see it offered by amazon and of course thats the most efficient way to buy it you see the cardboard boxes in stores as well in huge displays with the full screen and the widescreen versions alternating a checkerboard of bronze and silver whats all the fuss about many if not most of you are star wars fans already and while i dont want to waste your time by preaching to the choir for newbies sake i ought at least to say a little about the three movies in the just released star wars trilogy before we get into quality of transfer etc star wars to me is the classic space opera and i admire these three first films released by lucas most of all i wish the innocent fun earnest acting and slam bang heroism of a new hope the empire strikes back and return of the jedi technically episodes and of the star wars cycle but in actuality the first three movies to hit the screeen oh how i wish those qualities were present in lucas last two or three flicks from the star wars cycle technically lets recall that new hope empire strikes back and jedi were stunningly professional up to the minute works of cinema in their original period ironically though and with the possible exception of the aliens franchise these films will probably go down in history as the last of the great big budget analog or should i say pre computer animation era of of sci fi hollywood moviemaking before virtual reality cut out a considerable swath of old fashioned regular physical reality in the special effects canon of blockbusters the effort lucas co had to make to create those humongous space ships futuristic hover cars weird aliens and entertaining ambient sounds bespeak a level of sfx technology much closer to the wizard of oz than to say lucas latest releases in the star wars cycle this trilogy really pushes in our faces a dilemma that hollywood has until now successfully avoided should a restoration be true to the original cinematic release and entail only cosmetic clean ups or on the other hand should the joyous cornucopia of options that post cgi makes available to lucas be used by lucas to create special effects he wished he had back in the seventies well the jurys out and thats precisely because the kind of work put into this consumer product was indeed as a prior reviewer said rather half assed if you expect to see the limitations of that older technology ameliorated or eliminated with the tools of the digital era you may be disappointed with this new boxed set the editing and composition are almost percent the same as in the enhanced vhs video versions that lucas released years ago the cgi used here is the kind that excels in skittering little reptilians and rodents in the desert but no effort was made for example to give a realistic looking mouth to the blue headed assailant who confronted han solo in the tatooine saloon sequence early in episode iv perhaps lucas and fox were conflicted as to how many arguably charming flaws to leave in from s technology and perhaps lucas compromised by leaving the speaking parts alone to concentrate on the diddlies or maybe it was just done on the cheap of course the person who buys this new star wars trilogy will receive the net benefit of dvds superior rendition on a regular tv or hdtv yes the color is better but not perfect the sound is usually all right but it is pretty obvious when steps have been taken to punch things up by graphic equalizer enhancement or perhaps the actual human actors speaking and re looping their original scenes but one suspects that the high tech restoration enhancement of trilogy was pretty much a hands off project the level of now routine restoration technology that fox used in the original marilyn monroe diamond series is evident here you wont get speckles in the screen but im not seeing evidence of labor intensive human hours and decisions and all the kind of sweat and strain that made the monroe collection so desirable and so rewarding to own will lucas come out with a more scrupulously worked set at a higher price hell if i know hes about as predictable as disney was when founder walt was still alive was lucas attitude toward his enormous and potentially even more so enormous audience to let the force be with us or was it more along the lines of to the egress i dont know or care but i am giving this product five stars specifically because the bells and whistles were most everything a fan could want the commentary track for example voices not only lucas and carrie fisher but special effects luminaries ben burtt sound and dennis muren visuals all four speak from their areas of expertise and the result is harmonious informative and intelligent perhaps i should not be cheering so much about a commentary thats good solid competence plus but sadly this kind of careful preparation and assembly of talents is the exception to most dvd supplements please buy trilogy in the widescreen version not the dopey smashed full screen version 
this is a great set it comes with discs which have the original movies and redone version of the movies the digital remakes are good quality picture the original films show in a very small window on the tv and are grainy and not that great of quality but it is the original version what do you expect from the late s and early s either way it is a nice set because they include the original movies i am not holding out for any blu ray version how much better can they get the quality from movies that were filmed years ago the digital remasters are good enough for me in that case they look decent on the tv and i dont really need to see luke skywalkers arm hair thats a blu ray joke anyway this set is well worth the price if you are a star wars fan they come in thin dvd cases so the whole set does not take up that much room 
i just finished watching the entire star wars trilogy and all i can say is wow i was truly blown away my dvd collection is finally complete the films have never looked or sounded better ive seen all of these films multiple times and im seeing details that ive never seen before about the changes big deal be honest does not seeing cheesy footage of a landspeeder or a dog fight having been replaced digitally really ruin your precious childhood memory does seeing greedo shoot first really spoil the entire experience for you i was years old when i saw the original star wars in the theatre it remains to this day the greatest time i have ever had or will ever have at the movies no motion picture experience will ever top the thrill of seeing the original star wars for the first time does seeing an altered version in any way diminish that precious childhood memory not in the least bit because percent of it is exactly the same movie and the changes that are there are actually improvements this is the star wars i grew up with so to all those naysayers out there the ones whove given this trilogy star the ones who say they wont be buying it the ones who are still complaining about jar jar binks years after the fact why did you show up at the video store at am sharp on tuesday morning or worse yet at am on monday night why did you take tuesday off and spend the entire day watching all three movies why did you stand in line on opening day for both tfm and aotc you know who you are im a star wars geek but at least im not ashamed to admit it im not going to lie about it i loved tfm and aotc and i love my new dvds the original star wars is nearly years old if you hate it and its sequels so much why after nearly years are you still talking about it 
 a long time ago in a galaxy far far away im sorry about the title im sure that half the reviews already share the name and many more to come will use it too however it works very well so im going to stick with it anyway this review is not going to be like most of the reviews that i do in the sense that im not going to focus on reviewing the films themselves i think that you can find my reviews on the individual films but im not sure im going to focus on the release itself and the technical aspects and the extras this will be a day long remembered darth vaderso we finally have the original star wars trilogy on dvd this is something that people have been waiting for ever since the dvd format was introduced and now that we have it is it worth it do you even need to ask these movies have the distinction of being a cultural phenomenon something that few films ever achieve at most there is one film set of films per generation that achieves this level of popularity peter jacksons lord of the rings trilogy is currently the best contendor for our generations phenomenon they were a smash hit back in and i think those dates are correct and they were also technological marvels the stories have withstood the test of time like few movies can and while the special effects are beyond outdated watch these films after watching one of the new ones it does not matter at all because even though the effects are important in this movie we will always love them no matter how outdated they look speaking of the new trilogy i must say that while i really liked attack of the clones and cant wait for revenge of the sith and marginally enjoyed phantom menace these movies are far superior despite the advances in technology that abound in the prequel trilogy also i look at these movies differently now that the prequels are out before when id watch these i knew that luke skywalker mark hammil han solo harrison ford and leia organa carrie fisher were the main characters and darth vader david prowse james earl jones was the villain now i see vader as the main character despite being the antagonist and the rebels while they are important characters are not the focus of the film the two trilogies are best put as the rise fall and redemption of anakin skywalker jake lloyd hayden chritenson david prowse james earl jones sebastian shaw youve never heard of the millenium falcon han solofor the two of you who dont know the story of the trilogy you must be living under a rock on mars or something basically there is a galactic empire that is extremely oppressive and is run by two dark jedi or sith there is also a rebel alliance whos purpose is to overthrow the empire and return the galaxy to a state of peace and democracy they are soon joined by luke skywalker a farmboy who has the potential to become a jedi and han solo a scoundrel and an amazing pilot who has a price on his head due to a botched smuggling operation i can change him back luke skywalkeras for the extras we get great trailers and teasers all the way back from there are multiple featurettes and documentaries including one about the upcoming episode iii as well as empire of dreams which is apparently the most comprehensive star wars documentary ever made i have not yet watched the whole thing but ive really liked what ive seen as for the changes some of them are good some are not i am going to say this right now these are george lucas movies and he can change them if he wants to having said that there are some things that i dont like the added some stuff for humor but it really fell flat most of the time like when luke obi wan alec guiness c p anthony daniels and r d kenny baker go to mos eisly in a new hope also i understand why george lucas changed the han greedo scene he wanted solo to be a reformed scoundrel not reformed murderer so thats why han no longer shoots first however hans dodge looks so awful i wish it had been left as it was other non storyline changes mostly involve music in return of the jedi which while i like the old music it does not take away from the story my favorite change would be the addition of ian mcdiarmod as the emporor in empire strikes back mcdiarmod was always in rotj pm and aotc so it fit for continuity and the original emporor in esb was just bad they also overdubbed boba fetts lines with temuera morrison who played jango fett in aotc the story is that boba is a clone of jango so it makes sense for continuity even though i am in favor of this for continuity reasons i think that jeremy bulloch the original boba fett sounded more menacing the other continuity change is that instead of sebastian shaw playing anakins ghost now we have hayden chritenson i also liked this solely for continuity reasons all other changes from the special edition are still here she was very beautiful leia organai am now referring to the picture and sound star wars has never looked or sounded better with maybe a few exceptions here and there thx did a great job cleaning everything up there were a few places that could have been better but the film is very old and worn so it doesnt get much better than this the force will be with you always obi wan kenobiin conclusion this dvd set is definitely a welcome addition to anyones collection whether they are a die hard fan or someone watching the films for the first time 
many sci fi buffs tend to treat the star wars trilogy like it was the second coming it was a ground breaking effort on the part of george lucas but not exactly a world shaking revolution these films put to death the theory that all science fiction films must be quot b quot grade they were big budget hi tech well directed films with some excellent performances star wars launched the successful careers of so many people that they are impossible to list the first film quot star wars quot takes us through luke skywalkers discovery of his destiny he finds an old jedi knight ben obi wan kenobi who takes it on himself to train luke in the ways of the force unfortunately ben and luke get drafted by princess leia in an attempt to save her and oppose the evil emperor and his second in command lord darth vader they are aided by a smuggler pilot han solo and his copilot chewbacca in the fastest ship in the cosmos the millennium falcon some heavy duty action is had by all when leia is rescued losing ben in the process and the emperors death star is destroyed with only moments to spare before the rebel base was to be obliterated the second film quot the empire strikes back quot disappointed me at the time because of its open ended finish i have since forgiven it for this as with the first film the second starts by skipping some of the intervening background material so we are left to catch up to the plot by ourselves we find luke han and leia in a new rebel base on a frozen planet during an isolated scene where luke is captured by a snow beast we find that his jedi powers have developed a little more and that the friendship between he and han has grown even stronger but not to the point where their rivalry over leia has abated the empire locates the rebel base and they all have to turn tail and run yes we discover that the destruction of the death star at the end of the last film was nowhere near the end of the empire everyone bugs out in an orderly fashion except luke who heads off to find a new master by following the instructions of the now spectral obi wan han chewy and leia find that the falcon is in need of repair and have to limp to the nearest port of call luke finds the memorable jedi master yoda and starts his training meanwhile the falcons crew is in trouble after hans friend lando calrissian involuntarily betrays them to darth vader resulting in han being frozen in carbonite so its luke to the rescue the problem is that this was darths plan all along thus we get to see luke fencing with darth luke loses his hand but gains a father both against his will the final film quot return of the jedi quot was excellent except for the ridiculously cutesy ewoks we have to do another leap forward to catch the plot which has moved to the point where all of hans friends are involved in an attempt at his rescue han has been sold as a wall decoration to jaba the hut a type of mafia boss in the shape of a giant fat salamanda luke arrives and impresses the hell out of everyone with his new jedi powers with a little help he saves everyone and the movie moves on the empire is building another death star and the rebels have a plan to destroy it of course han luke leia etc are all critical to the success of this plan they must land on a tropical moon to disable the force field that protects the half built deathstar in the process luke is voluntarily captured and tries to turn darth his father away from evil we get to see another great dual between the two of them this time the emperor is on the side lines cheering them on whilst trying to turn luke to the dark side of the force luke is made of sterner stuff than that though meanwhile the rest of the gang have run into the improbable ewoks fuzzy teddy bear like people who seem unable to walk without waddling strangely they turn out to be useful allies in the capacity of scouts diversions and pesky warriors the force field is eventually brought down and the rebels attack only to find that the death star is not nonfunctional after all if it wasnt for darth vader turning against the emperor at the last minute in order to save luke all would have been lost many people have been awaiting more movies in the series a number of good follow up books have been written timothy zahns efforts are especially good however lucus has decided to go back in time and produce some prequels we will see a young version of obi wan as the hero it should be good 
first off i was a kid when star wars came out in and have loved all three movies ever since however some people are so fanatical about them that any slight additions or improvements to them is sacrilege folks this is the best scifi fantasy film of all time but its still just a movie the best thing about these movies is the improved picture and sound i tried viewing my old vhs tapes and they looked terrible after watching the rerelease back in the new scenes between all three movies probably clocks in at under thirty minutes so its not really messing with the pacing and feel be a star wars fan not a fanatic purist 
film classic i grew up with the movie and toys loved the special edition dvd contains original s s theatrical version plus collectors edition re edited with extra shots scenes and effects beginning in george lucas is a sci fi genius highly recommend this set 
i havent purchased the trilogy yet i was investigating the versions i read the one review that helps to clarify which boxed set contains the original release versus the special edition i still wasnt absolutely sure which one to get though so i went digging around and i found this comparison chart on amazon that i thought might be helpful to others so posting it here i didnt want to bring down the rating of this boxed set so i gave it stars just so i could post this hope its helpful to anyone else who isnt quite sure which set to get go to this link for the blu ray version then scroll down to find the comparison chart http www amazon com star wars complete episodes blu ray dp b zsj ref pd cp mov 
the star wars movies are amazing the sheer imagination that went into them is spectacular the original film a new hope topped the charts in and is still today the nd highest grossing movie of all time and with good reason the original star wars trilogy is one of the top three trilogies of all time and are a must see for the whole family the bonus disc this bonus disc is the best bonus disc ive ever seen the main feature a documentary called empire of dreams is spectacular its the greatest most comprehensive look at the making of these magical films the documentary is accompanied by minute featurettes trailers stills ect the films a new hope the film that started it all its amazingly acted directed and the script is engrossing its really hard to discribe all three of these films and thats really all i can say about this one you have to see it to believe it the empire strikes back this film has to be one of the greatest sequels of all time most sequels to successful movies are just rehashes of the original the work of a director trying in vain to recreate a masterpiece empire is one of few exceptions this sequel carries on the fight of the brave rebels against the evil empire things go darker this time around though its not hellish like the second indiana jones film the heroes lose a lot and it leaves you hopeful that things will get better though wondering how that could ever happen the return of the jedi this might be one of the greatest climaxes of all time great fights chases heroes and villains and weird aliens like the furry little ewoks everyone reprises their role thankfully and you finally get to see the emperor himself and trust me he doesnt disappoint this is a great wrap up to the amazing trilogy the quality george lucas adds to his visual stunning in this trilogy with new second long shots of aliens and enhanced picture this really ticks some people off but i think it adds to the films without really changing much overall great i recieved this box set a few years ago and have simply adored it since if youre a star wars fan this set is a must own and if your not a big fan even if you dont buy this set you should still watch the movies highly reccommended 
remember when greedo shot first or when there was an extra ewok song or when boba fett didnt have a new zelander accent these things are wonderful memories all this aside lets take this box set for what its worth a classic movie with a brush of new school every thing about the movies are brilliant or lucky and inspired or stolen with all the changes they are still the essence of what once was lets face it you still want to sit forward on your seat and go what when darth vader says no i am your father its classic moments like this that make star wars great if lucas wants this to be what is remembered then i guess thats what it is if he feels the need to relese the orginals then great but either way we should be happy at all that we got them on dvd the picture is astounding simply put it doesnt look like it was shot in and the sound lets put it this way i love to hear the tie fighters blasting right behind me and the huge boom of the death star exploding everything about this new release is great so onward to episode lets hope lucas comes through and brings us some thing as magical as a new hope i cant wait and see how he pulls this together so enjoy the new dvds thier worth the purchase and they will be worth it for awhile 
this was purchased for a christmas gift the grandchildren just love theset and watch it over and over 
ok so this a controversial dvd set lots of people love it many people want the original movies on dvd this is my opinion after seeing revenge of the sith some of the changes made are very nice others kinda unnecassary the changes made in jabbas appearence are nice he now appears as he did in the phantom menace giving a bit more consistancy to the sage lightsaber blades look better than ever especially in a new hope obi wan and lukes sabers are a brilliant blue throughout not appearing white at points like in the originals i honest to god dont care if greedo fires his gun first it shows han can stay calm and blast his enemies even when a blast hits inches away from his head this is a two second scene that to me has no real impact on the saga a couple other minor tweaks have been made in the death star words on a control panel no longer read power and tractor beam but instead have been changed to some star wars dialect not english for sure this is acceptable ian mcdiarmid has replaced the old actor in empire with slightly altered dialog informing vader of lukes true identity i really like this change the jedi temple and the senate can be seen on coruscant in the ending of jedi and even though it is reletively short the addition of naboo to the ending of jedi is one of my favorite scenes for continuity purposes the addition of hayden christinsen is also a favorite of mine i thought he did a great job in sith and think he deserves his appearence obi wan and yoda both appear as they did when the died anakin should too because essentially anakin died when he became darth vader as obi wan says in a new hope i am a fan of both the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy i believe the changes made are overall good for the movies continuity and its fun to see some new stuff as well as the old stuff digitally remastered again the dvds truely look and sound fantastic honestly i do wish lucas would release the originals unmodified on dvd so everyone could be happy but ive got my vhs tapes still so im holding out fine i love theses new versions much more personally check them out for sure along with episode i and ii on dvd those are great as well revenge of the sith is slated for dvd release on november th cant wait thanks for reading
there is a division among star wars fans about whether the revised newer editions are terrible and outrageous tamperings or if they are great additions to the remarkable cannon that has become a cultural icon the bad news for purists is that the new dvd set has more tampering and some of it isnt very good han solo still shoots second in the cantina and it appears in empire that poor darth vader is aware that someone named skywalker is in the hoth system but is completely oblivious to the fact that this skywalker might somehow be related to him that nothwithstanding the dvds are in better shape than the old videos you used to watch religiously and the whole of the works are not so disturbed that purists cant enjoy the other aspects not much more has been cleaned up since the special edition videos were released but the sound quality on the dvds is much better in most scenes the extras disc is absolutely loaded with documentaries commentaries demos and other expansive treats the extras on episodes and were exhaustive and compelling and they still pale in comparison to the volumes of interesting features packed into the th disc overall this compares favorably to last years release of the indiana jones trilogy it is well worth the money and worth finding space on your shelf for

i loved the first star wars aka episode iv a new hope i saw it in the theatre in and couldnt believe the realistic space scenery i was enthralled by darth vader and still consider him one of the coolest villains ever of course i was a kid back then i fell hook line and light saber for the whole phenomenon today i have to look at what i loved about the original trilogy as well as what i hated star wars episode iv a new hope i love the wide eyed wonder of it i love luke as a kid who stumbles into the greatest adventure of his life quite by accident han solo harrison ford as the rogue space pirate type anti hero guy hes a cool foil for lukes cream cheese goodiness princess leias carrie fisher as the damsel in distress turned warrior was deceptively ahead of her time is the perfect middle ground between the two male heroes i loved them together as the flies in the empires ointment george lukas drew from his childhood dreams fantasies and saturday afternoon movie serials to fashion a classic in its own right episode iv stands as a milestone in not only special effects but in sci fi storytelling it took something that seemed out there and made it accessible to folks like me the non sci fi bunch i loved obi wan alec guinness i loved the imperial ships the death star the land speeder the millenium falcon the sand people the jawas r d c po the goofy saloon scene and even leias hairdos i loved the whole bloody thing i just cant find anything to hate about this first sw effort of mr lukas dvd improvements lukes landspeeder is more realistic as its underside has been cleaned up lightsabers look much better mos eisley revised to make it look more like a bustling hub than a ghost town unfortunately greedo still shoots first scene with han solo and jabba the hutt restored and vastly improved over version jabba looks more like himself less like a mutated tadpole space scenes even more boffo than before scene with lukes friend biggs is restored deathstar explosion is extra cool then in came episode v the empire strikes back no george behind the camera and yet it is a great movie darker and far more ominous than its predecessor tesb features a growing maturing luke a deepening though guarded chemistry between leia and han and a gloom that slowly rises to ultimately engulf them all this is my personal favorite sw flick i love the ice planet hoth the snow monster encounter and those beautiful imperial walkers vader is an unstoppable evil bent on lukes either joining him or being destroyed the secrets revealed between them are legendary luke isnt as much of a boy hes a young man i love the dread and anguish in this installment it makes it all seem real and inescapable dvd improvements probe droid looks better snowmonster has added scenes where its eating lukes tantan snowspeeders no longer look cropped in imperial walkers look better too cloud city looks like its actually there rather than an added model hologram of the emperor changed from the goofy looking person in the original to the real guy ian mcdiarmid then theres episode vi return of the jedi i have mixed feelings about this one i love the space battles i love the speeders roaring through the forests like giant fuel injected mosquitoes i love jabba the hutts bulky nastiness and leias bikini i love vader and that super turd the emperor of course i love the plot and the way things turn out however i absolutely hate the stiff nearly robotic way that luke leia and han trudge through their scenes the chemistry seems lost and lukes jedi guru i am buddha thing grates my last nerve then theres those cuddly buy me at your local wal mart ewoks i hated them in the theatre in and i hate them now their part in the movie went on and on i wanted the imperial troops to take most if not all of them out i hate the teddy bear planet die ewoks die there i feel better now my yo son loves the ewoks though and maybe thats the point hes not old and jaded like his old man anyway i still consider rotj to be a classic just not as good as the other two in the trilogy dvd improvements the rancor has been cleaned up and looks fantastic it looks like its really after luke like its really there instead of an added claymation toy that stupid looking singer you know the walking belly with lips in jabbas lair has been replaced by a cgi version jabbas sail barge looks great now no longer a groaner the pit monster has been given a huge maw and extra tentacles it looks menacing and hungry the interior of the second death star is awesome watching the rebel ships fly through it now is even more thrilling like everyone ive been waiting for these babies to be released on dvd they are worth the wait lucas knew what he was doing afterall to be able to own them all like this is something ive looked forward to for years the star wars trilogy is essential viewing for anyone who has a childs heart and an imagination to match i get a little less crusty every time i see them i enjoy that far off galaxy and can never wear it out 
well i bought the star wars trilogy dvd and i just got through watching all the movies special features commentaries etc and it was lots and lots of fun the image and sound quality are top notch of course these movies no doubt look and sound better here than they ever have before as for the changes made by george lucas theyre jarring but most of them i think i will get used to a few tweaks here and there arent really all that bad i like the shots of the different planets celebrating at the end of return along with the new music that replaces that awful ewok chant and its nice to finally get to meet biggs right before the big attack on the death star im even beginning to accept the addition of hayden christensen as annikin alongside obi wan and yoda at the end of return and i dont mind the original bug eyed emperor in empire being replaced by ian mcdiarmid because he didnt match the character in return anyway one thing i still cant figure out why does there seem to be a crudely drawn black spot next to the emperors right eye during his final scenes in return it looks as though its masking something but what some of the additions were unnecessary i really didnt need to actually see a hand puppetty looking worm coming out of that hole that boba fett falls into on tattooine during the scene on jabbas barge nor does seeing a herd of banthas or stormtroopers riding around on digital beasts add anything to my enjoyment of the movies most of it is just george lucas irritating tendency to forever tinker around with his creations however some of the changes that particularly irritated me are greedo still shoots first although they made the time between his shot and hans shot shorter but who cares i liked han better when he just pre emptively shot first that totally fits his character at the time the scene where jabba confronts han before the millenium falcon takes off is all wrong jabba always struck me as a creature who is naturally too huge and bloated to be very mobile as in return where he lounges authoritatively in one spot and everything and everyone comes to him and it just looks dumb to see him bopping around like this the rebel fighters heading toward the death star are digital now i liked the old ones george i like seeing how the fx guys conquered challenges using the resources available at the time and managed to produce great effects that still look good boba fetts voice is now the voice of the actor who plays jango fett in clones so how come the stormtroopers dont all sound like him too the dancers performing for jabba the hut do a digital song and dance sequence now its pretty bad like something out of a third rate pixar movie im sure ill think of some others later but you get the idea the changes are there and were stuck with them so we might as well get used to them although this is why i wish the dvds came with both the original versions and the special editions the commentaries are pretty interesting for the most part lucas dennis muren sound designer ben burtt and carrie fisher appear on all three with the addition of director irvin kershner on empire there arent many dead spots but thats mainly because burtt goes on and on about how he obtained various sounds from dumpster lids movie projectors and whatnot its interesting in small doses but he goes on about it too much during scenes where i would like to hear commentary from lucas or muren kershner is a genial old guy who seems genuinely enthusiastic about his part in the star wars saga and its fun to listen to him even though a lot of his commentary is simply him excitedly telling us whats going on as it happens fisher pops in now and then with a few anecdotes lucas commentary contributions of course are the most substantive yet he frequently made me want to throw things at him with his constant griping about how unsatisfied he was with various shots and how this or that couldve been done better digitally before it was over i was thoroughly sick and tired of the word digital i feel that like myself a lot of the people watching these movies who have loved them for decades are entirely content with the way they look and how the fx artists of the time were able to solve certain problems and present incredible special effects that as i said before still look good even after the advent of cgi and other advanced techniques i wanted to hear how these movies were made not how much better they could have been made today lucas however seems totally oblivious to this and often speaks in a regretful tone during the commentary which is a real turn off he just doesnt seem to get the fact that these movies are so popular because of what they are not because of what they could have been as for the additional disc of special features theres a wonderful documentary about the star wars saga that lasts around two and a half hours there are also three featurettes of interest especially the one which features the likes of ridley scott james cameron and peter jackson talking about the effect star wars has had on them in addition to the usual trailers tv spots etc theres a preview of episode iii that shows hayden christensen and ewen macgregor practising what promises to be a major lightsaber dual between their characters and the construction of a new darth vader costume the video game preview is interesting too and contains more of christensen going through his moves for the benefit of the game designers an easter egg which can be found on the video games and still galleries menu features some outtakes along with the dvd credits its not very long and it seems as though more of this material could have been dug up for the dvd you can access it by punching in which activates a light next to r d then and then the still galleries contain photos from the discarded sequence in which luke hangs out with his friend biggs darklighter at tosche station in anchorhead surprisingly koo stark was in this scene as well which makes one wonder why lucas couldnt have included these scenes on the special features disc as well one possible reason is the fact that a special special set of all six films is already being planned and theyre saving stuff like that for it which means i guess that im going to miss out on it because theres no way im buying these movies again well thats my disjointed review of the new star wars dvd set all in all despite its flaws its definitely well worth having and is a huge amount of fun for the star wars fan 
you can either take it or leave it but no matter what you may believe star wars will always be star wars i have seen all the films so far including the untouched versions of the original trilogy and enjoyed each and every one of them my favorite being the empire strikes back out of them all truly i am very glad to finally see these classic gems on dvd and revealed the way they were meant to be when they were released of course the purists will not be interested considering the fact that they grew up watching them in the late s and early s the reason why george lucas had updated these movies in was due to the fact that he had a limited budget and very little time at the time they were originally made obviously if this had been differently nobody would be complaining period the changes barely affect the films negatively and they are still watchable for any sw fan young or old i myself am one of those for the changes due to that they help fix many of the bugs and glitches in the movies one being the transparent cockpit of the ships during the battle for hoth in esb another problem was the white and yellow boxes which would sometimes appear around some of the star ships this error has been fixed in the dvds and i am glad because to me it really got distracting at times the same goes for that funny orange blob below lukes landspeeder on tatooine however there are also some of the changes seen in the special editions that werent really necessary at all but fit into the movies okay one was with the greedo shooting first in episode iv which didnt exactly look as realistic but luckily in this dvd version it has been slightly fixed up a bit still making han solo look like a badass then lets not forget jabba the hutt who looks a lot more convincing and familar just like how he is in rotj rather than his original makeover as a slithering piece of turd in the version also its excellent that they replaced the so called monkey eyed woman with ian mcdiarmid who plays palpatine and the emperor in the prequel trilogy and episode vi it gives a hint of continuation to the prequels with the slightly altered dialogue another fix was the part with the emperors scream in episode v as luke chooses to plummet to his death yes it has been edited out as it originally was in the version and im glad they did this because it doesnt make sense to have emperor palpatines voice coming out of lukes mouth the same scream was also used in episode vi when vader throws palpatine aka darth sidious down the beam cannon in addition the black circles around the emperors eyes has also been removed making him look even more menacing and nightmarish than ever as for hayden christensen replacing shaw as anakins ghost i didnt mind this at all again it gives a sign of continuation finally the lightsaber effects for all three films has been enhanced and even the obi wan vs vader duel looks more epic than ever with all the added in flashing effects and sound the dvds themselves are in their best picture quality it looks almost as new as the quality in episodes i ii and the dolby digital ex sound transfer has never sounded better than ever of course you also get the choice to watch them in surround sound when i first opened the package and popped in the first disk it felt like i was watching the movies all over again for the first time never have i seen star wars like this i do agree that we shouldve also gotten the original and releases because it would have been nice to reflect back on how they were originally made without the added cgi effects scenes etc this would also appeal to diehard fans of the series sadly george lucas doesnt want to put them on dvd for now at least however we do get to see bts footage for episodes iv vi including a bit of a sneak peak at episode iii and the original theatrical trailers t v spots for those who are against this release i would have to disagree because this is the best and only dvd experience of the films you will be getting for now honestly i dont see what the problem is and i wouldve bought this set whether it was the original or special editions because it clearly makes no difference unless you have nothing better to do than to waste your time obsessing and whining about it after all the special effects added scenes and altered music actors are not the only elements these movies are about its also the wonderful storytelling and acting the many different planets and creatures that inhabit them which george lucas introduces us to the beautifully composed score by john williams and the london symphony orchestra that will always be there just buy the set pop in your favorite episode pop a little popcorn sit back and enjoy the movies with an open mind im very glad that i bought this set and am now waiting patiently on the theatrical release for episode iii which will be coming may th once that one comes to dvd the following year i will finally be able to own all six episodes the force will be with you always alec guiness as obi wan kenobi
considering how old the movies are i really thought a bluray transfer would make them come off as harshly cartoony but since i didnt get the unchanged dvd versions when available endless regret i needed a set i could watch with my new hd tv however i was blown away by the sound and clarity and the amount of clean up in the special effects all creative changes aside these films look absolutely fantastic and i was literally giddy as i re watched them again 
i was super excited when i heard they were finally coming to bluray too bad their not the original editions 
the blu ray format really sharpens these movies up and brings out sharp details in the backgrounds that were never noticed before they altered a few things from the last dvd set release for example they changed boba fetts voice to the same one as django fett they made vader yell nooo at the end of return of the jedi and they added some visual details that were not present from before overall the changes add more positives than negatives and it just depends on what the particular person likes and doesnt i thought they were fair changes to keep things looking fresh and to help keep things compatible with the prequel trilogy for those that dont like the changes i think disney will release the movies in original unaltered formats someday these films never get old for me and they are a treasure to have in the best format possible 
the sound quality has improved magnificently and a great series of moviesa new hope awesome and revolutionary for its time the special effects still hold up well today and the story is great every single one of the characters are likeable there is really nothing i can say about this movie that hasnt been said before best parts the gun fight that han solo gets in leaving the mos eisley spaceport the battle of yavin the whole cantina scene this my second favorite movie of the original trilogy empire strikes back meet more awesome characters special effects have are even better story is even better than a new hope you get the new mind blowing planet of bespin which is such a beautiful city that you wont see anything like it in another film best parts the lightsaber duel between luke and vader when han solo opens the door in bespin and shoots at vader and vader blocks it the battle of hoth best of the original trilogyreturn of the jedi awesome movie again the best action sequences of the original trilogy you meet the emperor sadly you meet the ewoks who take little away from this great film best parts action scene outside of jabbas palace lightsaber duel between luke vader and the emperor speeder bike chase least favorite of the original trilogy but great movie nonetheless the empire strikes back attack of the clones revenge of the sith a new hope return of the jedi the phantom menace it sucked 
look im excited for the trilogy to come out on dvd but i want to have choice which version i watch how hard can it be to put out two versions of film sources say that you plan on using the special edition version of your films but please for those of us that grew up with these films put out the original versions that werent tampered with ive got the stargate ultimate edition so i know it can be done so do it for the fans that grew up with these films instead of the ones that came after a fan oh well im thankful i still have thx mastered vhs copies of the original films because ill probably be watching those i never was a very big fan of special edition expect for adding the jabba the hutt scene in the first film besides that tweaking these classic films was a sin my book but like i said include both versions in the same case its a just an idea 
these are not the original versions of the film and that doesnt really bother me too much id like to have a copy of the originals on dvd just to have them but its not really that big a deal we cant really argue with what lucas does because if he says that this is the way he originally intended the films then they are he made them not us so with that being said these movies look great on dvd they are so clear and crisp that you will be surprised i was expecting something good but this was beyond my expectations they look great and the packaging is great too the set is very much worth it 
these are great movies and you must buy them this coming weekend the new special effects i think will work when you see them many people are complaining but i think they will turn out nice it is also a treat to have these on dvd and thats really cool i also think that there will be more dvd editions of these film in the future lucusfilm and th century fox can make more money that way i think that they will do what they did with each of the alien movies oh thats another great sci fi series to check out once star wars episode iii revenge of the sith arrives on dvd and video fox will release an alien quadriolgy type boxed set for these films and also release them sepertly this mega boxed set will include star wars episode i the phantom menace regular and special edition star wars episode ii atteck of the clones regular and special edition star wars episode iii revenge of the sith regular and special edition star wars episode iv a new hope regular and special edition star wars episode v the empire strikes back regular and special edition and star wars episode vi return of the jedi regular and special edition the regular version would be the origional cut that was in the theater back in the s and s and nothing new added and for the prequel films the origional version from the s and s now for the special editions not the new movies from this set but the special editions they are not on dvd either so they can also be included as for the prequels they can just add deleted scenes since the effects are amazing already then add lots of features i know they have but just waiting for another addition to release them so when you buy this boxed set and the alien quadtiolgy type boxed set you will have all three additions of the origional films then like the alien films from the mega boxed set they were all released sepertly as collectors editions so then all star wars films will be released under that title and everything is put to rest thats what i hope will happen but that might not be for years and years so ill keep my fingers crossed other classic sci fi films alien series the matrix series star trek motion picture series back to the future seriesoh also when your out buying the star wars boxed set make sure to buy thx lucus first movie and it to is remastered and special effects special effects are also new so make sure to pick that up as well and its classic sci fi so pick that up as well 
 quot may the force be with you always quot obi one kenobigeorge lucass unforgettable star wars is one of the most influential mythically engaging and highly enjoyable science fiction films of all time though it can be said that lucas borrowed cinematic ideas from akira kurosaka hidden fortress howard hawks and john ford the searchers does star wars really deserve to be called too simplistic or underserving of all its popularity no no no star wars is modern film myth that has engaged its fans in its timeless tale for the last years what the star wars haters need to realize is that we the fans find this wonderful myth of good evil fate and destiny to be one of the most enlightening and blissful voyages that the movies have ever given us star wars is a tribute to the power and expressiveness of the movies what make star wars so superior to the numerous clones that followed it is despite its magnificent special effects that defined a new age in sci fi the films characters mythos and epic story are what made star wars so universally accepted and beloved around the world not only have the characters of luke skywalker darth vader han solo and r d become permanent parts of movie culture the simple yet important moral that good will eventually overcome all evil no matter the time suffering loss or failure involved makes star wars the modern equivalent of the wizard of oz it tells its tale simply and elequently it moves us with its images and people it takes us to a time and place that will never leave the boundries of our memory star wars is joy to behold and anyone who feels otherwise is too stuck up to see the beauty of a universe a long time ago in a galaxy far far away star wars fans may the force always be with each and every one of you i cant wait to see all the episodes on dvd 
i just recieved my copy yesterday and i am very pleased they finnally are the films they were meant to be yeah there are the changes but these changes are for the best and yeah it is not the original relase but those in the eyes of lucas were half baked jobs these are the final product however it would have been nice if some of the deleted scenes like the approch to the ships in the sand storm in rotj were put back in heck that scene was even part of the original trailers from the s but that being neither here nor there these are a nessecity for any serious dvd collector 
this is a review of the blu ray dvd trilogy pack darth vader is on the cover with a red light saber i own the trilogy pack that includes the originals but bought this set for my library heres the thing i care about the originals children of today dont they like the changes and updates and who am i to judge this set is affordable and compact for circulation often these dvds go missing from library collections or they end up damaged to be able to replace them at an affordable price is of high priority importance this set is great for the next generation of star wars fans and at a great price if you are a classic lover get the box sets with iv v vi on the bottom and luke and darth with clashing sabers often copies can be found at a reasonable price in a few days the price jumped from to not cool amazon 
well george lucas edited the movies im sure no director ever edits the movies and make them something other than what we saw at the theater come to think of it i can name you a great number of directors cuts so why should this be different granted i too wish that they included both the original and modified versions all i can say is that im ecstatic this is finally coming out on dvd it is still the best trilogy to me and it has tough competition with the harry potter and lord of the ring trilogies i enjoy the new releases but the magic of the original three movies cant be beat when i saw the original star wars at the theater in it was not chapter iv a new hope it was just star wars in fact i went to see it fourteen times it was the best thing i had ever seen i even bought all the star wars toys i could find even though i was an adult am i complaining about more movies or editing no quite the contrary why would i complain about mr lucas making five more movies to carry on the saga you can bet i have pre ordered my set you will not believe how crisp and sharp the picture and sound quality are in these movies they did a magnificent job of transferring these to dvd so many extras where do i begin deleted scenes cast interviews bios documentary directors comments and more this set is so chocked full of goodies you will think it is christmas the documentary about what george lucas went through to make these movies is incredible his sacrifice has made millions happy there is some interesting information on all the companies he helped form to make these movies possible the movies alone had you ready to buy but when you see all the extras you will know you made the right decision speaking of christmas if one of your friends is short on cash and doesnt get it be sure you get it for them as a gift 
baby boomers gotta have the box set darth vader c po r d yoda obi wan han everbody looks much better digitally remastered it is part of quot our generation quot you simply must own this set it is a part of our heritage 
now if george lucas would get off his bum bum and release this on dvd the th anniversary series is a great series to the die hard fans who always want to see something different lucas takes advantage of the situation and creates some extras and adds deleted scenes that were not in the original movie while adding a few seconds here and there it provides small changes but do not add or subtract away from the story star wars is the greatest affected by the changes even though return of the jedi has a completely different ending and star wars fans will eat it up the picture quality is excellent for a vhs tape and sound is very good however tape just doesnt have the quot sparkle quot of dvd due to its lower resolution the colors will always look a little washed out and grainy to the disc also the pre movie stuff interviews behind the scenes stuff should be taken off or put on another tape do i really want to sit through minutes of lucas ranting and raving the second time i see the tape if you havent gotten this series yet now is ther perfect time with lucas thx technology this is a great tape and its widescreen however if you are a die hard dvd fan you might want to wait although no one really knows for how long rating a
ive heard alot of negative reviews and comments about the recent release of the star wars trilogy on dvd but star wars fans rejoice the original star wars in their theatrical version will be released seperately on dvd shortly after the release of star wars episode iii revenge of the sith to coinside with the release of the new star wars film the dvd releases will offer the original versions untouched by current special effects and the special edition versions on dvd sets for each film email me for web address info dont worry star wars fans the original star wars is in our galaxy not to far into the future 
the only thing i can say negative about this is lucas again has altered things the most notably is the ewoks now have eyes and blink they no longer look like their eyes are plastic sunglasses not sure if i like this or not just tired of lucas constantly changing things but the movies do look great in this format if you are looking for the special features get to movie box set 
i think if this box set release proves anything its that nothing can diminish the astonishing achievement of lucas vision and determination in creating spellbinding adventures in other worlds i first ran into star wars in when my dad took me on a holiday to california were from australia to graumans chinese theatre to see this new science fiction film i was seven years old and the experience literally changed my life i now work as a director in television commercials and films in australia probably largely because of that day by self description then i am i guess a classic star wars fan but do i believe in the originals over and above the new reworked special editions and amended dvd editions well frankly im divided let me tell you first without hesitation buy this collection no amount of tweeking by lucas can obscure what is above all else a brilliantly constructed universe and epic narrative i must say that even though i am highly critical of the prequel films that fact that i had seen i ii and iii added immensely to my enjoyment of watching the classic trilogy again knowing the background storyline somehow is a perverse thrill as if you have power over these characters struggling to find meaning as they are thrown into peril and adventure a few comments though on the experience of watching this trilogy evolve listening to lucas on the commentary track he participates on the audio commentaries for all of the films star wars is like the most expensive and detailed train set a hollywood whiz kid ever conceived and he literally cannot keep his hands off it an adjustment of colour here an extra creature there tweeked audio enhanced skies some of the changes are very subtle others are jarring the general rule seems to be if you dont notice it its good for example the cleaning up and enhanced shots in the battle for the death star in a new hope are brilliantly executed and seemless with the spirit and excitement of the original to be honest its never looked so good if all of the fixups had been this classy id be ecstatic the use of additional digital creatures in mos eisley on tatooine is ill advised because it intrudes on the mood of the original film why does every new creature need to demonstrate some slapstick hijinks to make its presence felt couldnt it simply form part of the backdrop as it would in reality its as if lucas felt that having spent money on the new creatures they bloody better do something to get noticed unfortunately many of the enhancements belie the problems with the prequels and most of these problems are associated with story and character deficiencies han solos added conversation with jabba in a new hope adds nothing whatsoever dramatically to the film and in fact holds it up when the rampaging pace of the original film is what made it such a revelation at the time likewise lukes catching up with an old buddy before getting into his x wing for the death star battle is clunky and slow thats why it was cut in the first place put it in the deleted scenes section for crying out loud i am one of the reviewers who definitely does have a problem with han solos scene with the bounty hunter which lucas altered so that solo shoots only after the hunters first shot the fact that solo beat the bounty hunter to the kill told us a lot about who he was and dont forget this is the first time you see him hes a mercenary not a girl scout who waits to be fired on these touches are politically reactionary no wonder lucas struggles to create good characters now when hes afraid to give them light and shade it has become obvious following the prequels that solo is still the most successful and popular character in all of the films why is this its his humanity and cynicism that holds the sympathy and amusement of the audience lucas fantasy world is so much more powerful because of the wisecracking disdain that han solo has for it he dominates his environment as a character unlike every protagonist in the prequels most of whom are developed little more than playstation characters completely dwarfed by the special effect landscape the prequels sadly lack characters with han solos attitude ewan mcgregor has a crack in rots but hes struggling against a witless script whack on episode and and watch harrison to see how its done its impossible to take your eyes off him still even in the classic trilogy you could see harrison ford starting to look accutely embarassed by having to act against ewoks and by that stage the acting and space opera whoops a daisy was starting to suffer drastically from a serious case of the cutes as you can probably tell im not a huge fan of return of the jedi ironically being the most recent of the classic trilogy its also the most dated with an unhealthy reliance of eighties pop influenced music especially the dire variety entertainment scene in jabbas palace at the beginning of the film mystifyingly extended in the special edition and also by the over reliance on ewoks clearly small people in relatively inexpressive furry suits still despite it all at its best for me rotj still betters of the prequels possibly rots outdoes it occassionally due to better plotting and vastly better special effects the main cast from the classic films ford hammil fisher can still act rings around anyone in the new films especially in tesb where they are at their dramatic and comedic peak a new hope and empire are simply magnificent on every level and empire has been far the best treated by any lucas updates on this release it looks absolutely breathtaking and irvin kirschners direction is just the kind of planet hopping adult science fiction adventure that we all feel we have been promised and aside from blade runner and alien have never had since so for my money lucas has done enough to make this one of the most satisfying experiences youll ever have with your dvd player for consistency and attention to character and emotions i think he has now been outdone by peter jackson and the lord of the rings trilogy but these films were here first they changed the world and even made us feel that we had a new religion in a flagging spiritual era for all of these reasons i think lucas has earned the right to keep playing with his train set as he sees fit im still happy to watch on and enjoy its worth mentioning that the min doco on the making of the films included in this set is absolutely wonderful full of fascinating and frank details on the mountains lucas had to move both technological and political to make these films happen enjoy 
after reading some of the reviews i was afraid that i may have made a mistake in purchasing the four disc set of star wars a lot of reviewers wrote about muddy colors poor picture quality etc they could not be more wrong the picture quality of these dvds is the best i have ever seen for these movies after watching episode iv i am stunned about the excellent quality and look of polish of every scene the whole movie looks better than i have ever seen it i dont remember it looking this good in the theater or on any vhs tape that i have seen it on over the years in fact one of my biggest complaints with the original star wars over the years has been the grainy picture quality and poor contrasting that always tended to spotlight the weaknesses in the special effects of the time all of those special effects flaws seem to have been miraculously fixed i cant believe it its like the movies are now shiny and new they could have been made in instead of my memories of star wars always included some of the special effects flaws of the seams of space where the models did not contrast correctly and blend with the space behind them those flaws are gone and i couldnt be more impressed with the outstanding picture quality of these dvds they did a terrific job on the film cleanup 
special editions or not these films are the pinnacle of most peoples cinema experience seriously does a few minutes seconds of changes tweaks ruin something this special these movies are what dvd was made for and i for one cant wait empire alone is worth three times the price of this timeless set so called purists resisting this out of pride or whatever do yourself a favor and drop your pride and your wallet in september your dvd player will thank you 
star wars represented a landmark in motion picture history it was the beginning of the summer blockbuster a film that catered to teens and younger it was the first film to have significant marketing tie ins modern hollywood owes much to star wars for better or for worse but the most extraordinary part about the original film is how well it stands up today it is the classic good vs evil story about a boy and his friends overcoming enormous odds to rescue the girl and save the universe from destruction for my money star wars now subtitled a new hope is the best of the three i can still remember how thrilling it was from when i first saw it the dvd version has the special edition enhancement computer generated effects and characters the enhancements are well worth while they do not change the story and anyone who opines for the good old days ought to look back at the original effects in the death star battle which definitely benefits from the new effects the middle film the empire strikes back is probably the best made of the three the dialogue is better the story is well developed and the effects are of contemporary quality pretty amazing for a film released in return of the jedi the rd film suffers mainly from the performances the leia han love affair is ponderous as bad as anakin padme in ep ii and harrison fords portrayal gives you the sense that he would rather be making indiana jones movies instead however it satisfactorily wraps up the series and the ewoks really arent that bad this dvd set has a few new surprises a couple of which are welcome from a continuity perspective inserting hayden christiansen and ian mcdiarmid as anakin and palpatine in rotj and tesb respectively unfortunately the emporers new dialogue is at an episode ii level of lameness but its only a minute long scene so i can live with it as for the sound and picture its great to finally have these films on dvd they are very clear and crisp the extras are very good although there are some curious omissions the two extras i would want to have most cut scenes and a feature on the comparison between the original and the special edition would have been very welcome in fairness we see parts of the cut scenes biggs camie and fixer making fun of luke for example in the making of feature and the still photos likewise the feature has some aspects on the difference between the old and new versions of the films but nothing like what appeared on the special edition vhs set however even the most dedicated star wars fan will learn a lot of new stuff watching the features and the commentaries by lucas burtt et al are generally entertaining and informative 
my set had everything captioned even the the extra stuff i cant remember any set ive ever seen with such a thorough job of audio accessibility i was so impressed that i tried to email george lucas or his company through his website while the extra stuff might not seem like much i enjoy it in some cases more than the movie itself to me the captions there are even more important because walking interviews background shots etc can be even harder to understand thanks mr lucas 
as these films have been reviewed and dissected many times over not to mention the ever raging debate over the special editions vs the original versions im not going to go into an in depth story review or comparison here these films waited way too long to be introduced to dvd which is strange considering how george lucas seems to love pushing technology these films are the basis for his continuing standing in hollywood as well as the launching pad for several movie careers can you say harrison ford watching them now you can see why everyone went wild back in again in and yet again in the basic plot of good vs evil with plenty of temptation along the way for good to go astray is as mesmerizing today as back then a much needed restoration and clean up both to picture and soundtrack left these films shining like diamonds with crystal clear sound they never looked or sounded better of course lucas being lucas made even more changes to his films before releasing them on dvd much to the ire of star purists these changes are relatively minor and are done to better fit the original trilogy with the later prequels if you are one to fuss over any changes to a film you already love these alterations will drive you to distraction however the majority of the films remain unchanged from their theatrical run in the late s i really wont go into whether i think lucas should have left well enough alone or not however i do think he should have put the original versions with this set instead of releasing them separately at a later date the bonus features are a treat unto themselves with a whole disc to devoted to them this set represents hollywood story telling and imagination at its best and a sizeable chunk of movie history not only is it worthy of being added to your collection it really should be a staple of any movie collection because it is hollywood history 
these movies were already a good even before they became dvds george lucas knew this and toke advantage of it and did a good job besides cleaning up the film itself and a few scene edits its realy just the old movies on dvd so if you have the movies already then i wouldnt get then unless yours are worn out but over all a realy good mvie to watch

star wars is star wars noone complained about alien apocalpse nw or blade runner so why all the fuzz a reviewer pointed to this article and said that lucas didnt care about his fans thats only halfway true what he says is im sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it but i want it to be the way i want it to be im the one who has to take responsibility for it im the one who has to have everybody throw rocks at me all the time so at least if theyre going to throw rocks at me theyre going to throw rocks at me for something i love rather than something i think is not very good or at least something i think is not finished and later but they all have very strong ideas about what should happen and they think it should be their way which is fine except im making the movies so i should have it my way so there live with it get over yourselves im so i was around when the original movies were released and have seen each of them around times the special editions dont detract from the joy on the contrary im exited to see whats new buy or buy not there is no in between and its your choice 
well i enjoyed the set i bought it the week it came out just like all the other star wars sets that have come before i have the original set from the early s the letterbox version the re release version of the mid s the special editions and now the dvds i have three versions of the phantom menace attack of the clones on dvd lets not go into all the other star wars stuff i just cant seem to part with in years of collecting ect ect suffice it to say i am a huge star wars fan oh yea and i am a mid year old gal with all that in mind here is my humble review i loved the set it was crisp clear clean the picture is absolutely gorgeous the soundtrack is so clear you cant hear any distortions if this is what we have been waiting for all these years fine with me the bonus material is really cool there are a few documentaries specials tv commercials i loved watching the old trailers i remembered them as soon as i saw them very cool i wish they had added the older cbs docu special that they did in or with c po r d my taped copy is in really bad shape that is fun to watch just to see them bickering i havent seen them all but i have seen two so far well worth the price of the set on their own for the changes the emperor vader scene in the empire strikes back i think it flows a bit better and having ian in the scene is much more believable biggs scene in star wars a new hope its a bit out of place since you dont see the friendship with the two developed a bit more i believe the only way to see those scenes are on the insiders cd rom of a few years back and the novel so i was able to piece that together in my mind but i suspect that the new fan or someone who was a casual viewer might go who is that the biggest change of course is hayden replacing sebastian shaw okay ill admit it this was the one and only time i cringed for a star wars update i thought why but i have to eat my words it worked i liked the effect now i will say they should have gone a step further where is qui gon if they went as far as changing out sebastian where is qui gon hmm you know the guy who found our little bundle of midi chlorians but back to hayden the effect was believable it looked like he was there back in do i miss sebastian no why i have prior sets of vhs tapes that are mine forever to watch when i want to see the big guy more star wars to watch and enjoy nit picks i want the added scenes where is luke on tatooine fixing the vaporators hanging with biggs yea i listened to the commentary for star wars i heard what george said bonus disk bonus george i want the sandstorm scenes in rotj i want r s run in with a wampa at least they are on the cd roms but still i am very greedy lets face it these movies were written and released years ago qui gon and crew were not yet around so george is attempting to tie the whole series together i think he is doing a good job at it the changes flow they dont leap out at you saying hey im a new scene yoo hoo the reason they seem that way to most older fans is simply because we are used to seeing the movie a certain way for over years people reading this may wonder why on earth i am happy there are all these changes i remember the s after when return was out i remember all the years when star wars was done gone and pretty much forgotten there were the west end game books and that folks was it one thing i would get so upset about is you could find book ater book on star trek nothing on star wars it was pretty pathetic for the star wars fan then the mid s came timothy zahn and the new movies star wars has been back ever since at the end of the day would i like to have the older versions sure but i am of the opinion the more star wars the better so in my mind george thanks bring it on new old updates special the more star wars from the father of the force is fine by this star wars fangirl 
let me start by saying that i do not live in my parents basement i have never dressed like one of the characters of the star wars movies in private or public and i am grounded in reality neither i nor anyone i know can use the force that being said i was thrilled when i learned about the star wars trilogy box set i picked it up the first day it was available i knew beforehand that i was buying the re released films and not the original versions i didnt care i was very willing to hand over the for these remastered movies the dvds are well worth the money sure there are some changes to the original movies some addes scenes some added effects so what they dont hamper the story in any way they add to the visual magic that has always made the star wars series so jaw dropping and so much fun to watch i wont bother reviewing the individual movies because the odds are good anyone reading this has already seen them scores of times but i do want to note that the bonus th disk is really great the empire of dreams documentary is informative and fun to watch and really shows how much hard work lucas and company put into these films this disk is a must view for fans of the films and will increase your appreciation for all of the movies ten fold i wondered if the star wars trilogy would hold up well i mean i was years old when the first one hit the theaters and was amazed by the movie i was completely sucked into the story and became a fan of the series right away now i have a six year old son and i wondered if he would like the films or if they would seem out dated and lame compared to what is available to kids today i popped in a new hope on saturday and was able to enjoy star wars in a whole new way through the eyes of my son he was soon absorbed in the story and carried away by the magic only star wars can perform right after the film ended he asked if we could watch it again and was delighted when i told him there were still more movies to go we have watched them all now finishing return of the jedi last night and now he wants to watch them all again starting tonight sure lucas changed some of the scenes added some stuff but the magic is still there just ask my six year old 
the wait was worth it the star wars trilogy dvd set is gorgeous complete with the three original films ok special editions if you want to get specific and a superb disc of bonus material including all the theatrical trailers tv ads and a hour documentary with never before seen footage what really stands out upon viewing is the picture quality of the films episode iv a new hope has been cleaned up so well it doesnt look like a year old film anymore same with episode v the empire strikes back these could pass for films made in the s which brings me back to the new cgi enhanced scenes i may be in the minority but i have no problem with george lucas tinkering in the special editions the new footage clashed with the worn look of the original footage it almost seemed as if you were watching two films not anymore because the films have been cleaned up so well the newer scenes blend in much more seamlessly than on the vhs versions in addition episode iv s han solo jabba the hutt scene is improved thanks to a new better looking cgi jabba modeled after the one used in episode i the phantom menace i also loved the inclusion of ian mcdiarmids emperor palpatine in the empire strikes back i really feel the films are stronger because of these changes as for the big change in episode vi return of the jedi i dont have an issue with hayden christensen replacing sebastian shaw as anakins spirit so much of jedi s last minutes were altered in the special edition this change hardly matters realistically dont expect this to be the one and only dvd release of these movies once episode iii revenge of the sith is released next summer and the series is concluded a box set of all six films would be the next logical step perhaps then if the fans are still asking for it well get the special editions and the original versions in a complete package for now enjoy this the force is strong with this one 
yes i grew up with these three wonderful movies i saw them all during their original theatrical releases way back when and they have had a profound impact on me i dont mind the changes lucas has made for their special edition theatrical releases nor the further changes on these dvds i feel neutral on some of them and others such as the new music at the end of return of the jedi i think are a definite improvement on the originals undoubtedly these changes make these three films a more cohesive whole with episodes i iii the movies themselves are all excellent and the only one i find slightly flawed is return of the jedi its a fine film and it just isnt quite as good as a new hope or the empire strikes back the dvd transfers are superb and the extra disc of bonus material is bountiful a minor complaint about this stellar release is that i do wish that there had been even more extras when there was so much available i for one would love to see the original making of star wars special that was aired on television in and hosted by r d and c p the extras which are provided are excellent i just wish there were more when i know more do exist this a wonderful and very welcome dvd release 
briefly stated the classic modern space opera fantasy for literally everyone yes like many others i find george lucas a little hard to take but i do like this trilogy and i just hope he stops tinkering with it lucas said in an interview film editing is never finished it is just abandoned okay fine lets not think that this idea of his to constantly tinker with these the most profitable films of all time is motivated by copyright laws that protect each update for the next or years well i am starting to have trouble believing that his tinkering has anything to do with our enjoyment and that is coloring the whole star wars experience about the dvd great sound and video the transfer is sensational and it is in widescreen it does however include changes and additions that are sometimes disturbing perhaps the most disturbing of his tinkerings was at the end of the return of the jedi where lucas not only changed the scene the setting and the music but he even changed the face of anakin skywalkers ghost to match hayden christensen the new and improved anakin skywalker character there are so many such examples that to enumerate them would probably injure anyone reading this reviews enjoyment of the film trilogy special features too many special featuresthe main hour featurette is for the most part excellent and though subjective very interesting the three other featurettes however are another story they basically tell three minute tales from different viewpoints about how george lucas was on a mercy mission of sorts as a filmmaker when he with the force as his ally took on the big studios to become a big studio himself as a sort of parody on his star wars franchise i like to think of the scene in the revenge of the sith where ewan mcgregor as the new and improved obi wan kenobi screams you were the chosen one you were supposed to destroy the sith not join them to the new and improved anakin skywalker in a dramatic moment it seems that mr lucas may have followed in anakins footsteps featurettes propaganda is not something viewers should pay forin the featurettes we saw testimonials from many of industrial light and magics leading customers like james cameron steven spielberg peter jackson and ridley scott each in their own words described how lucas and star wars revolutionized the motion picture industry and forever improved everything in the world for everybody but especially for filmmakers and moviegoers bottom line i wish lucas would just stick to filmmakingi wish lucas who is widely known as the proverbial closed mouthed man and as such a very poor communicator who is silent when he should speak and often picks the wrong time to talk would learn when not to speak up these featurettes though stunningly well made were clearly the wrong venue for lucas to go on a personal diatribe while bragging about how he owns all the rights and has made riches beyond measure in the end the star wars trilogy is a wonder of the modern worldwhen you look at the movies alone however this trilogy is a wonderful work of art that was exceedingly well done when it was made long ago and far away we might all enjoy and appreciate the films on that basis 
the only reason people are rating this package low is because its not the original cut a lot of people are just copying the early mid s laserdiscs to dvd at this point i do think that they should have given the customers the individual versions like coppola did with godfather and maybe george will but also keep in mind years from now is the th anniversary of star wars spielberg gave in on et with versions for a bit although i think he has the revamped version on market now if the originals are released itll be around that time and prob as part of a huge package to get people on board hi def dvd ive watched the revamped trilogy more than once and still enjoy it as much as the untouched version but the disc set has a really good documentary about the making of watch lost in la mancha to see a movie made by terry gilliam in the desert that failed miserably lucas wasnt that far off back when if youre not the type to lose sleep over han shot first want to save a few bucks and arent the type to watch making ofs this is worth it because it is still one of the best trilogies ever made 
my husband thought this was the greatest gift ever so score its great to have both the original theatrical edition and the remastered as well perfect for any star wars lover 
while i love the remakes as much as the originals i think my favorite part of this collection is the bonus disk there are interviews and lots of making of footage where we get to really see them putting together the original low budget films my favorite part was when they were filming the ultimate destruction of the death star and you hear some guy in the background go boom the secrets behind the making serve only to add to my enjoyment no matter which version i am watching 
i love this set i am not a starwars fanatic but i am a fan my little brother and i watched the first one times and would have gone a hundred more if our parents hadnt put their foot down i am that generation you cant mess with perfection which is why i wanted this set i wanted the versions i saw in the theater before george hacked them up and tried to make them better you cant you shouldnt would you redo gone with the wind frankly my dear i really give a damn or casablanca are you ready ilsa no im not im coming with you no you wouldnt dare phere you get the first movies in all their cinematic glory along with the versions that george messed up it actually is nice to have both so that you can compare what you get is basically the first films as they were released individually as limited edition disc sets but all in one box these are classics and need to be in every video library in america enjoy and may the force be with you 
the original star wars trilogy will always stand in first place for my sci fi loving heart when it comes to classic wonderfully told space adventure the special effects were groundbreaking at the time and today are just as powerful though we would do them differently now the characters are multi dimensional and the story of good vs evil is masterfully played out for anyone who loves sci fi this needs to be at the top of the list 
finally george lucas got off his horse and decided to have fox release these classics on dvd must have been either all the great sales of phantom menace and attack of the clones or that paramount put out speilburg indiana jones trilogy which i believe lucas had a hand in on discs as well i for one am glad the discs will be the special edition re releases i admit with some films its good to see the originals vs the special edition on the same disc for comparison but this is one of those rare times that the special editions were so much superior to the originals that i could accept these as orignals forget about the and copies respectively and respectfully these reissues on tape are better and on disc will be superb besides only the original print of jedi gives credit to the great james earl jones as the voice of darth vader while the special editions of all do the man justice order this set be it full screen or widescreen and between now and september buy yourself a multi disc player so you can enjoy all back to back in one sitting 
although this is the special edition i cant help but love star wars from the moment i saw those yellow words scroll to the top of the screen i was hooked i can only hope that lucas will put out the originals as they were my only complaint is that hayden christianson replaced sebastian shaw in the end sequence of return of the jedi i could only accept it if they had replaced alec guinness with ewan macgregor it just did not make any sense plus hayden looked akward and out of place other than this unnecessary change i loved the set 
im sorry for those who were upset by it but i like it im truely sorry but i got so tired of popping in my original vhs tapes of the original trilogy which were only worsening throughout the years please note i am practically though so ive grown up very used to this technilogic movie awesomeness as much as i loved them i couldnt handle the vhs anymore im too adapted to the dvd player with digital sound and video some of the changes made me go wha like the gungans at the end of return of the jedi the hayden replacing the orignal anakin spirit really didnt bother me but some others were awesome like ive heard people complain about the emporer scene change in esb but i think that was needed the first spin around it wasnt good old evil ian playing the emporer and was totally off the emporers character so that change i was very happy of as for the dialouge there yea its kind of weird but i think it makes sense i like how its crisply put together now with very good sound updated lightsaber quality and ship quality and all that again just a reminder i am i really like digitally remastered 
still star warriors will want to add this set to the shelf along with all the various editions of vhs relive the shining innocence of star wars the grim drama of the empire strikes back and the campy fun and stunning special effects of jedi once again may the force be with us forever 
okay of course i havent seen the dvds yet so the star rating is simply because its star wars well it used to be star wars some of the retouches i dont mind ie it always drove me nuts that you could see the cells around the spaceship models in anh but some are just there because ilm is saying look what we can do the most obvious and obnoxious case of this being jar jar binks now im not sitting down with the tape here so i might not get the dialouge exactly right but i know ill get the gist of it enough to demonstrate that han solo was justified in shooting first greedo perhaps i can take you to jabba myself solo over my dead body greedo i was hoping you would say that ive been looking forward to this for a long time there now in the same situation wouldnt you fire first granted han was preparing his balster as soon as greedo sat down but can you blame him its one scene that needed no tampering with it just doesnt look right 
well the dvd is clean and has nice color and sound but greedo did not shoot first jabbas appearance is a waste and is redundant script at best mos eisley is crowded and cluttered with cgi junk we all could go on and on one thing when luke and company go tumbling in to the trash chamber you can still see luke mouth what was that with all the corrections made one might think they could have fixed that one why george lucus tampers with a masterpiece i do not know at this rate if he ever aquires rights to the wizard of oz he probably will colorize the sepia tinted beginning and end i am now years old and star wars is a pleasant memory and it is nice to see it in widescreen again remember when it first came to the screen many of us baby boomers were expecting a cheapo scifi flick and to the casual movie buff no one even thought of a sextuple series you didnt even know there might be a second one until the end of the movie when vaders ship tumbles off in to space to be honest i think im one of millions that truely enjoyed episode iv a new hope and in my humble opinion none of the others have ever come close to duplicating the pure magic of a new hope anh was groundbreaking and revolutionary for its time but as enjoyable as star wars was and is i suggest everyone follow bill shatners advice get a life other wise just enjoy 
these are good fun movies the dvd versions are a blast get a life you pathetic complainers 
great dvd enjoyed it when it first came out and now part of the collection too bad they didnt finish the plan of making the nine movies would have been great 
this ones a home run ive got an old letterbox videotape in which han shoots first and i infinitely prefer it to the other versions vhs and dvd that ive acquired over the years the ship designs take earlier work silent running in particular also dark star several steps further the cinematography set a new standard lucas essentially pioneered computer graphics after taking models as far as possible its a terrific story first rate find yourself a copy of the hidden fortress a japanese samurai film star wars was very loosely based on the idea of droids being seamlessly integrated into everyday life was brilliant the dialouge is truly awful at points but somehow the three leads pull it off alec guiness lends credibility to what might have been a lightweight outing otherwise i wish that i had anything good to say about the sequels that followed this incredibly great picture they just dont measure up this however is one of the best films ever made 
star wars the original trilogy episodes iv vi blu ray reviewas someone who sat through these movies at the theater as a teenager more than a few timesand having a blast there were a few things i felt could have been added or changed so seeing changesnow does not bother me as the star wars original trilogy is still great to all those purists if you can see the story through the tears buythem and enjoy yourself pq gets stars auido gets extras star as for the extras keep it in mind that you will not get much with this trilogy set if you are like me and care only for the movies this set is perfect 
i have the dvd box set of star wars i have all the prequels dvds in there original individual packaging and i have the ot box set dvds with the unaltered special feature of the original movies you know the one with han shoots first i think it came out in so when i saw the blu ray star wars saga go on sale i had to jump at the chance to get it just one problem i dont have an hd tv or a blu ray player well over the years i have bought an hd tv but i am so low on funds that i had to settle for just the hd tv no blu ray player may be in the future so when i saw the blu ray dvd combo pack i bought it and i am glad i did 
listen i need the original trilogy ive had it release both spielberg did it universal did it why cant lucas do it i mean ive seen two movies on one disc come on this is bogus luc ss i hate you and god forbid hire a good screenwriter and irvin kershner for episode iii i guess its too late now ill never again see star wars the empire strikes back or return of the jedi the way i did in the s and s i better kiss it good bye thanks to you luc ss 
 classic sci fi masterpieces that will live on and on i have absolutely adored these movies since i was a kid and could not even tell you the countless times i have watched them over the years there may have been a few little things changed over the years a couple of things that were maybe a little disappointing but overall they are the same great flicks from way back when essential musts for any good sci fi movie collection definitely blu ray upgrade worthy 
apart from not having the choice to view the original prints this is a must for any star wars fan if disneys beauty and the beast can have three different versions on one disc theres no reason why fans cant have all versions other than that the movies are crisp and clean 
these films look really good cleaned up only thing george shouldnt of changed added was the greedo han scene in episode the han walking over jabbas tail scene in episode and the change to the end scene in episode at the end where yoda obi wan and anakin are all standing together smiling at luke replacing the old darth vader with the actor from episode was just plain out dumb 
to all those out there complaining of this re release im am glad i have the original pre special editions i never purchased the special editions and never got to see them in the theatres when they came out in had a new born and that took up all my time so when i eventually went out to purchase these movies just before episode i came out i was disappointed to find that they were no longer in stock and that they stopped all production of them so this re release has allowed me to purchase what i never got to see before and own them i have enjoyed the added touched up scenes case in point the cloud city scenes it seems so much more open and spacious now compared to the crampt feeling you envision in the original as for the jabba the hut scene in episode iv it allows you to understand more about why han had a bounty on his head i read the original book back in so i knew who jabba was even though i wondered why he wasnt in the movie heck he was even in the comic book edition of the movie so i was really confused as to why he wasnt there so the scene helps build up to episode vi when we finally come back to jabba the only gripe i have is how did he get so big so quickly i mean how much time has really elapsed between episode iv and vi jabba must have been stuffing his face since han left him hanging dry in episode iv in any case this release is a god send for me to finally own all four episodes the wide screen edition is what i purchased and like the other reviewers stated it allows you to see the scene as it was meant to be since movies are formatted for the theatres not your tv screen in fact i bought another copy of episode i this time i purchased the widescreen edition thank you george lucas for re releasing this timeless classic so that i can finally own it 
i do own all three disc sets as separate units i havent seen them for less than bucks each as one reviewer says but i have seen them available at walmart for each and thats a real good price also the picture looks really good for both the special editions and the original versions the special editions are enhanced and are slightly better than the originals but the orignals look as they should the same way as shown in the theater in their first run i dont know what animorphic and non animorphic is those words have no meaning for me i watch either version and enjoy it very much these discs were viewed on both a glass tube television and an lcd widescreen tv everyone was pleased with the picture and couldnt believe when i told them of all the negative reviews complaining of picture quality if youre still skeptical about what i have said see if you can rent them or borrow them and judge for yourself my beef is that these movies did not have the limited months availabilty like the lucasfilms publicity machine said they would have so i rushed to get them i could have saved about you can still buy them if the tin is important to you and money is no object go for it may the force be with you 
ive had this set since it came out so i decided to add my two cents on it i know there are fans who hated the fact that lucas changed things from the original but i say what he did made them better i like the way they look now and it also helped them since he made the prequels for me it was awesome to see some my favorite movies from my childhood come back to the big screen and have things added and enhanced i really thought the extras did the movies a great deal of justice and made them look better it made them look less fake and more real so basically you either like it or you dont so if you dont like it dont buy it and let those of us who do like it enjoy it 
im saying this to those who have said things like who wouldnt want to see these films updated with all the new technology well i and it looks like many feel that way i think others have said this but i will say it again its not the new scenes that bother us old star wars fans its the way theyre being offered we watched movies that were great for their time and thats why we love them great things dont need change if they did they wouldnt have been great to begin with im only years old and have seen both versions of the films i obviously saw the older versions first when i was a kid and those are the ones that i love if i were to have seen the special editions first my thinking might be different but i didnt and its not all im really saying is is it that hard to release two different versions of the dvd set i mean cant they just clean up the old one surely they can otherwise there wouldnt have been any special edition to release if fox and george lucas want to do this right they will release the original set and a special edition set it cant hurt they did it a while back on vhs and i know people who have both so it can only be a good thing money wise i understand about the continuity thing but its null and void when you try and change things people have already seen and liked then all you accomplish is people saying things like what the hell was that and that isnt right so again i say release both versions and then everyone will be happy jin fact i wouldnt be surprised to see a set with all six movies in it in about years or so maybe by then there will be a choice i cant wait for the third installment and i have to say i liked the last two movies as well but in my mind the original three will always be the best and all i want is a dvd set of the movies i grew up with 
i must say it is nice to see the original trilogy on dvd i had got the set on vhs sometime back which looks good but is already starting to show wear and tear the first film remains the standout picture in this series loosely based on kurosawas hidden fortress it incorporates a wide variety of science fiction themes into an action packed adventure empire strikes back and return of the jedi lack the initial punch but taken as a whole it is an immensely rewarding set the prequels are more spectacular in terms of scope but nothing compares to the impact these movies had on the general public when they came out in the late s and early s a space odyssey lavishly portrayed space but took a decidely existential approach to the subject whereas star wars treated space as a wild frontier it has spawned a slew of imitators but few have matched the vigor of this great series 
one of the most anticipated blu ray release of all time is finally here weve all seen it numerous times and every media outlet imaginable has either quoted it or used it as a hook for our attention why does it get our attention because it is one of those films that has an in depth fantastic world with clear defined lines of good and evil backed with a powerful plot filled with likable and detestable characters most of all its so much fun to watch because no matter what age you are it brings the kid inside of you alive alive is what you will feel when viewing these blu rays these blu rays are by far the most impressive i have ever seen of an older movie restored many times unbelievable was the word that came to mind picture quality on all three films is crisp and clear the best they have ever looked and then some the light sabres glow with intensity darth vaders helmet shines with mirror like blackness and certain scene details come to life for the first time several times i found myself looking at the characters detailed surroundings instead of the character themselves the picture quality on all three films has been so thoroughly examined there are not any moments where you wish they could have done more in any particular scene the picture quality is simply amazing and your eyes will be glued to the screen with the dynamic dts hd master audio mix that draws you in with its dynamic use of the sound field the picture quality is amazing but the dts hd master audio soundtrack is in one word awesome if ever you wanted to be immersed into the star wars universe this soundtrack will leave you awestruck star destroyers rumble the scene as they pass over tie fighters scream from the rears to the fronts as they fly over and fight scenes come alive like an actual war is taking place in your media room at ats speeder bikes darth vaders voice i could go on and on about this unbelievable soundtrack sound is so important to bring a movie to life and lucas spared nothing on this soundtrack to give these classics a new dynamic feel overall a must buy for any star wars fan these films have never looked or sounded better then they do in this aweinspiring release i am going to go out on a limb and say this is by far the best blu ray release of the year do not fall into what so many have already done and not buy because of additions to the original theatrical version these additions are minor and do nothing to the overall enjoyment you will feel when watching these films in hd i encourage everyone to do what i did and buy these films and watch them for the first time you will be amazed at all that hd has done for these films amazon has an incredible price highly recommended 
tomorrow the star wars trilogy will finally be released on dvd and today i am watching return of the jedi on dvd youre probably wondering why that is well its one of the great perks to working in a video store its great the picture is great all of the original material is intact the only problem most people are having with it is the added material that lucas added to the movie a few years ago its ridiculous for the uproar over the use of the special editions for the dvds that are coming out this is the way lucas wanted it to come out originally and as the artist in this situation he has ever right to add what he wants to artistically of course most of the problems that people have stem from the question who shot first greedo or han i read an interview with george lucas where he said that the main reason people want to think han shot first is because you kind of want him to be a cold blooded killer but he isnt that type of person the way lucas originally envisioned it was that they either both shot together or greedo shot a hair before han but it completely makes sense for him to fix that misunderstanding im not going to lie and say that i love every change that was made i dont particualarly care for the musical number in the jabba the hut scene at the beginning of return of the jedi and jabba doesnt quite look right in his new scene in a new hope but these do add somewhat of a greater understanding to the storylines they inhabit allow george lucas to do what he will to his films the movies he created none of you were the artist behind the script or the artist behind the camera so allow that artist to do what he will and just enjoy the ride 
the original versions are only in the trilogy dvd set with the blue and black cardboard cover and luke and vader at the duel on cloud city on the front each film comes with discs the first containing the re mastered version in and the bonus disc contains the original theatrical versions of the films in stereo this is pretty much the only set with the original un altered versions of the films unless you still have a vhs or laserdisc copy some have complained that the films look terrible on an hdtv but if you have the widescreen version and a newer blu ray player to watch them on they look pretty good in my opinion plus you cant really complain about the look of the original and versions since you cant find them anywhere else on dvd and lucas has already stated that he will not release them again the only thing that bothers me is the stereo but i decided to watch the films with a stereo gaming headset instead of my surround and it worked out great this set is rare and hard to find ive had mine since it released in and have not seen many others if you are looking for the original versions of star wars then make sure you get the set with the cover i described at the top 
i dont think i need to do a review on the movies themseleves since there are so many already but to prevent confusion the box with luke and vadar in mid light saber duel with a blue aura around them have the original theatrical release of the movies on the bonus discs amazon for some reason probably a deal with lucas combines all the reviews for every version of the trilogy into one so you will see the same reviews for different versions 
following the tremendous success of the re release of the th anniversary editions of quot star wars quot quot the empire strikes back quot and quot return of the jedi quot all three of these films have been put together into one box set each movie contains extra footage that was not included in the original films such as hans encounter with jabba the hutt at mos eisley all of the action and adventure that we all have grown to love over the years is brought back to life and the new scenes are excellent as well this set is a must for star wars fans i still like this trilogy more than episodes and i think the story lines and characters are much better in this trilogy buy this excellent set and relive the star wars saga over and over 
star wars is etched in the cinema landscape as the film that changed the movie industry forever some people hate it for that but no one can deny how much it opened the doors to more exciting and creative movies only a space odyssey had centered its subject matter in space back in star wars premiered with clunky but still start of the arts effects its characters were like nothing ever seen before and the cantina scene could be compared to nothing at the time now with the dusk of the newest generation of star wars movies quickly approaching george lucas has taken his prize possession and made it what he always wanted it to be whether you like it or not is totally your own opinion personally the only flaw i can see is the greedo shoots first scenerio and this is only because it doesnt look good no matter how much technology they throw at that scene it doesnt look right other than that everything else is spectacular the additional scenes creatures vehicles and cityscapes to me they all add to this world that lucas wanted so badly to create in but couldnt due to lack of budget and distrust of the material personally i love it there should be an extra ten minutes of cgi dogfighting scenes in the final battles there should be a long panning shot of the cantina showing the managerie of creatures that he envisioned i just wish they could get the puppet jaba to look as good as the cgi one yes there is texture and reality to the puppet version but cmon he only swayed back and forth when he moved if they could mix both technologies somehow couldnt it work all of this is creative and its georges work and world and we just get to play in it everything else about the movies stands firm the characters the story line the plot nothing else has changed to say that you want the old version back is like saying you would rather have the old mustang that is beat up and not maintained vs the completely restored mustang in any case to each his own i bought this trilogy on dvd the day it came out i saw star wars in the theater when i was seven years old and it has been my ultimate dream to have a lightsaber and use the ways of the force cmon i was seven anyone would have some people would think thats geeky but i bet they would change their tune if they saw someone try to mug you when youre armed with a three meter laser sword in true progressive nature george lucas has upped the bar on his creation with completely digital sound and picture this movie looks fantastic and sounds just as good i cant wait to get a wide screen tv to see how it looks the minute documentary on what it took to make all three movies is almost worth the price of the set alone but there are three other shorter documentaries that are very well done too one in particular that displays ewan mcgregor and hayden christiansen practicing their lightsaber dual for episode it looks like this one is gonna be quite intense this trilogy is timeless no matter how many additional cgi creatures vehicles and spaceships lucas superimposes to the original track in the end its all about adding to the strong story that is already there the good vs evil bloodline is still there the excitement and escapism of another world is ready to be experienced george lucas created something that has stayed with us for over years and will keep going no matter what anyone thinks of the new movies or the changes made to the old ones 
its hard to believe that its been only years since the original star wars now known as star wars episode iv a new hope was released thus changing the movie industry as we know it sure jaws is considered the original summer blockbuster but it was star wars which introduced the concept of a larger than life over the top movie that wasnt based on a biblical story which would resonate with the public in a massive way indeed star wars may have been indirectly responsible for the decision to revive star trek as science fiction and fantasy suddenly became a viable commercial proposition after letting the original trilogy languish on vhs and laserdisc for years george lucas finally relented and released this dvd boxed set in which includes all movies and a bonus disc however these arent exactly the movies people might remember from long ago which ill get to in a bit if youre a newcomer to star wars ill try to cut to the chase about what made these movies special with the readers digest version a young filmmaker from california having had some modest success with his coming of age nostalgia flick american graffiti decided he wanted to make a movie based on the old flash gordon serials finding that the rights had already been taken by someone else lucas decided to instead make his own sci fi fantasy story and forged a vast array of influences including the lord of the rings japanese filmmaker akira kurosawas feudal epics s serials such as flash gordon world war movies and much more into what would become star wars the creation of the original star wars was plagued by problems including financial problems a general lack of faith by some crew members encroaching deadlines hostile weather and lucass own near breakdown from the strain lucass team had to literally invent new types of special effects in order to avoid a plan from outer space type disaster when the movie was finally released cast members actually did a double take as their experience during the filming never indicated that the result would be so incredibly dynamic the empire strikes back and return of the jedi both served to expand the scope of the star wars universe and solidified the series as what joseph campbell would term modern day myth a new hope establishes the main characters and the primary struggles of the original trilogy some of which already have been introduced to some degree by the subsequent prequel films droids r d and c po escape a besieged ship carrying a rebel leader leia organa and end up on the desert planet of tattooine while leia is captured by the empires sinister darth vader when the droids are bought by luke skywalkers aunt and uncle luke finds that r d is carrying the plans to the empires gigantic and deadly space station the death star recruited by obi wan ben kenobi a former jedi knight and master of the mystical force luke and company engage the services of rogue space pilot han solo and his furry wookie co pilot chewbacca to try to get to alderaan from there the film builds up to a climactic battle over the death star as our heroes get into one sticky situation after another theres a reason that this movie defined the event movie from that point on off the cuff natural delivery of dialogue fantastic special effects creation of a living imaginary world and very effective if archetyped characters in lucas latest tinkering for he tries to half way amend for the greedo shoots first gaffe of the special edition version by having both han solo and greedo shoot at almost the same time while this wont appease everyone its still enough to keep the scene from looking silly as was the case with the special edition edit the crude computer effects from the special edition are also touched up resulting in jabba appearing much less like a crude mid s playstation cutscene relic the empire strikes back picks up months after the original film with vader who survived obsessed with finding luke who along with leia han and a contingent of rebels is hiding on the frozen world of hoth luke after surviving a near death experience at the hands of a monster is told by the spirit of kenobi to seek the jedi master yoda in order to master the force unfortunately vaders massive fleet has located the rebels and launches an attack on hoth in the confusion han chewie c po and leia are chased by the empire across space while luke trains under yoda on the swamp world of dagobah eventually luke confronts vader in a dramatic duel where he learns a terrible fact about their true relationship while han and leia fall in love but are tragically separated empire is cited by most fans as their favorite perhaps in part due to not only the darker tone of the movie but also due to the fact that it truly expanded the scope of the star wars universe most of the changes made in this movie are minor cosmetic changes with the exception of the re dubbing of bounty hunter boba fetts voice by temura morrison who played jango fett and the clones in the prequels and a partial reshoot of vader talking to the emperor with ian mcdiarmid being inserted in this scene with revised dialogue return of the jedi begins with an extended sequence detailing luke and leias rescue of han from jabba on tattooine when all is said and done our heroes emerge victorious but find themselves facing a much bigger conflict the rebel alliance has found that a new death star is being built and that the emperor himself is overseeing the construction luke and friends are tasked with destroying the protective shield generator on the forest world of endor but find themselves walking into a trap while the rebel fleet finds itself cornered by the empire in the end luke must confront vader and the emperor and take on the role of the last jedi of all the original trilogy movies this one suffered the most from lucas tinkering in the form of the horrid jedi rocks musical sequence incredibly lucas is apparently blind to how hated this muppet show sequence is and has not altered it or restored the original version of the scene the other major controversy in this version is the removal of sebastian shaw from the final shot of the force ghosts at the end and the insertion of hayden christiansen who played anakin skywalker in the prequels this change is nowhere near as unforgiveable as keeping jedi rocks which came this close to making the movie unwatchable while the film itself is the weakest of the three with harrison ford sometimes pretty much phoning in his performance jedi still ends on a positive note and wraps up the whole saga nicely if a bit abruptly all changes aside the video quality is pretty good although you can sometimes see blatant matte effect squares around tie fighters in a new hope lucasfilm was meticulous about removing dirt and age effects from the films as much as possible in terms of extras the bonus disc includes a number of short features and a definitive star wars documentary titled empire of dreams the commentary tracks for the movies are entertaining and pretty informative being certainly more dynamic and insightful than much of the commentary for the prequels the audio is also pretty good although the actual sound quality in a new hope is markedly duller and more muffled than in any of the other star wars movies either an unfortunate byproduct of the original masters degrading or of the equipment used circa the simple truth is that unless you are someone who dislikes any kind of speculative fiction fantasy movies you must have this in your collection i should note that lucasfilm re released the original trilogy in in a collectors format containing both the current versions and the pre special edition versions of the movies however this is more costly and the original unaltered versions of the movies were not properly cleaned up or adapted for the dvd format so for the less hardcore fans youll be fine with the boxed set 
it seems like once every decade some from of entertainment comes along that just speaks to me on all levels it captures my interest and i want to know everything about it and experience it again and again these days its the music of bruce springsteen the book lonesome dove did that for most of my childhood it was star wars ive never completely lost interest in the movies but that interest in the original star wars trilogy was greatly diminished by the inferior phantom menace and wretched attack of the clones prequels the inconsistencies the overemphasis on bad special effects and the overall poor writing and acting in the two newest movies really tarnished my memories of the originals some of that was justified as the weakness of the prequels made the flaws of the originals all the more evident but how could i have resisted watching on dvd what were once my alltime favorite movies especially when my own children were aware that they were about to be released and were expressing the same interest that i had shown when i was just a little older than they are now back in i couldnt resist that and im glad that i didnt despite their vastly sub par prequels these movies are as wonderful as i remember them and seeing them in this format on a low end widescreen tv with a moderately decent surround sound system has actually been more enjoyable than i could have imagined and lets face it like a lot of people who grew up in the s and s i know every second of dialogue sound effects and music in these movies i could recite them in my sleep im not sure im proud to admit that but its the truth you dont get that way by disliking a movie i got that way because at one point these films were so good and so entertaining that you wanted to see them over and over again yeah the responsibilities of adulthood take away some of that magic some of it but not all of it everything that was wonderful about the original star wars movies remains so there are so many unforgettable sounds and images some of them major some of them tiny the stark white of the rebel cruiser the glowing eyes and gibberish of the jawas the hiss of vaders breath luke first igniting his lightsbaer and that imitable hum the otherworldly weirdness upon first entering the cantina chewbaccas grunts and growls the corridors of the death star the murky water in the trash compactor luke and leia swinging across the chasm ben kenobi disappearing upon being struck down by vader those awesome gun turret chairs on the millenium falcon the orange flight uniforms of the x wing pilots the explosion of the death star the blue ice of hoth the lumbering bass of the at ats yoda raising lukes x wing the danger of the asteroids hurtling by the falcon those bounty hunters like bossk and ig the beauty of cloud city the hellish glow of the carbon freezing chamber i know the thump of carbonite encased han solo landing on the ground the clash of light sabers between luke and vader princess leias devastation as boba fett narrowly escapes with han vaders terrible revelation on the gantry after luke looses his hand the rebel fleet gathered around the nebula the first glimpse of jabba lukes somersault over the sarlacc pit the arrival of the emperor the speeder bikes the lightening from the emperors hands vaders final act of goodness the victory fireworks over endor and those ghosts smiling at luke at the end and theres that wonderful glorious music that underscores the whole thing thats another whole review by itself that i wont get into here the list goes on and on and on and you know exactly what im talking about those images are indelible in our imagination and will be with us for the rest of our lives never mind the ewoks and the dumb looking aliens in jabbas court and the illogical physics theres so much good in these movies that the flaws are easily overlooked its only a movie but for a brief two hours its much much more than that lucass changes range from needed to unacceptable i dont have a problem with updating the special effects although as the prequels reveal cgi is really no match for detailed models props sets and costumes those discrepancies are especially apparent with the new found clarity that dvd allows but they dont distract from the film nearly as much as they do in the prequels have i mentioned that i dont much care for those the addition of jabba is unnecessary and while a bit better than in the version still embarrassing replacing the original ghost of anakin with hayden christensen is the change that i found to be the most offensive i understand the logic behind it but i think its terribly disrespectful to remove a longstanding actor who is now deceased who has long been identified with that role no matter that the role is minor lucas should have considered that the timeline and the choice of actors didnt match up with the original movies when casting anakin for the prequels rather than undoing his sloppiness later its an ominous sign and an indication of whats wrong with his current style of filmmaking that lucas values technology over an individual performance but overall these changes dont distract from the movies they are basically as you remember them since were not going to convince lucas of the evil of his ways id rather have the dvds with the changes than to not have them at all i know i know more money in this pockets that just reinforces his misguided notions anyway the extras havent watched the main documentary yet but it sounds good i enjoyed the trailers and tv spots talk about bringing back memories the preview for episode iii is intriguing but doesnt reveal much the video game advertisements are worthless and wont help this set from looking dated in a few years id have liked to have had deleted scenes an isolated score and a few more things but overall not a shabby set of extras besides were buying this for the movies themselves and these things are just icing on the cake video and sound are fantastic although these movies are all over years old and wont compare to modern films that were made with dvds in mind some odd mixes for the score in ep iv with some of my favorite bits of music being faded out at very inopportune times lucasfilm claims that this was intentional but theyre pretty good at following their bosss lead of revising history so i dont trust them but again overall very spectacular use of dolby and widescreen and for the love of god people buy the widescreen versions even if you dont have a widescreen tv you just dont know what youre missing in a fullscreen format if you loved star wars back then or now go buy these dvds thats what it boils down to if you want star wars on dvd this is how youre going to get them thats not a bad thing you can complain about the changes and the poor quality of the prequels all you want i certainly do but that doesnt diminish how truly wonderful these movies are even with the relatively minor changes made to them over the years nothing can replicate the first time you saw them but seeing them on dvd comes pretty close enjoy them with your kids watch them alone whatever but theres no diminishing the fact that for millions of people many of us now on the near side of age these are simply the greatest movies of all time the force was with us to have been born at the right time to see and love star wars 
hard to believe that almost thirty years ago these words crawled across our movie screens and changed the movies forever now after all those years the films arive on dvd for the first time and they look great my only wish is that they were two disc sets like the other movies that have been released these are the first or really the last three movies in the tale of civil war in a galaxy far far away and it is so easy to get caught up with luke leia and han that you will want to sit and watch all three back to back sure the f x are a little dated now but they were and still are some of the best ever done and this simple story of good vs evil is one of the best movie series ever done the extra disc has a great many extras that will keep fans happy and make this a set everyone should have in their colection 
these are three movies that changed the way of sci fi fantasy and cinema alike george lucass masterpieces of epic adventure in space the first movie a new hope is tells the tale of a farmboy named luke skywalker mark hamil whom joins up with two robots a furry wookie and captain han solo harrison ford to rescue the lovely princess leia carrie fisher then try to defeat darth vader played by david prowse and voiced by james earl jones the second chapter empire strikes back is after the events of a new hope with luke being trained by master jedi yoda voiced by frank oz to become a jedi and discovers a dark secret that has been kept hidden from him for years and finally return of the jedi deals with the final battle against the empire as luke dukes it out with vader and the emperor in a effort to save the universe three classic sci fi fantasy movies that made it into the greatest trilogy on film next to indiana jones and lord of the rings they grossed millions of dollars at the box office excellent acting inspiring special effects and good plotlines help this movie nothing cant beat the holy trilogy of movies the dvd has finally came after years of waiting i can say the dvd boxset totally delivers all the great stuff like remastered picture digital sound qualities commentaries by george lucas and a great th disc with great extras like featurettes a look into the years anticipated episode iii publicity and more these movies definitely belong in every dvd collection and is a satisfying dvd boxset for everyone to have 
since george lucas seems intent on waiting until completing his current trilogy of prequels before issuing the original quot holy trilogy quot on dvd unless you own a laserdisc player this is the best star wars you can get the box set includes on vhs each of the first three films star wars empire and jedi in the special edition versions re released in theaters for the twentieth anniversary of this cultural phenomenon like or hate the updated effects and footage of the special edition films the cleaned up video and sound quality resultant from the restoration of the original prints are a necessity for the true star wars fan older versions of the films watched side by side pale in comparison and televised pan amp scan versions cannot compare to the theatrical widescreen presentation simply watch for the sand people scene in star wars when luke says quot i can see one of them now quot to see why films should always be presented in their original aspect ratios finally what true star wars fanatic can be without even a single edition of the films if you sleep on jedi sheets named your dog boba fett or have a life size cutout of han solo these videos are required inventory for your collection 
yes i paid the absurdly high retail price of mumble mumble dollars for this back in the s those were glorious times it was pre special editions i still have a working laserdisc player and i get the increasingly rare treat of watching the pretty much unaltered versions of the original trilogy films any damn time i please while i have no doubt the blu ray versions released in september will look fantastic there is still something to be said for the originals never had a complaint about them before the days of dvd and blu ray so there really is nothing to complain about now either still shaking my head in disbelief over how much i paid though wow i must have been high 
these are the first star wars ever made and they are the best this trilogy also comes with the same movies but with better sound and more color when i was growing up i never watched these things but i can appreciate them now glad ive watched them now i have to watch the other 
the star wars trilogy on dvd a new hope the empire strikes back and return of the jedi a ridiculed set of dvds except for the outstanding bonus material dvd which has been universally praised however this set is not ridiculed nearly as much as the blu ray set of the entire six movie saga in this set you get regular non blu ray dvds but the picture quality is great in my opinion the sound suffers in certain parts particularly in the empire strikes back but overall its great picture quality and good sound quality george lucas made several changes to each movie this is controversial and has been ridiculed lucas should release the original unaltered theatrical versions of all six movies some day sooner rather than later customers are getting impatient lucas should give the people what they want i was fortunate enough to see the original star wars in the theater when it first came out in may of back then the opening crawl did not have episode iv a new hope in it instead it was just the background story the star destroyer that flew overhead that was chasing the rebel ship was so memorable as was c po r d the stormtroopers princess leia and of course darth vader i took off half a star due to some of the changes that i didnt care for such as greedo firing first in a new hope jabba the hutt appearing in a new hope ben kenobis call to scare away the tuskin raiders in a new hope and darth vader exiting his shuttle in the empire strikes back i also didnt care for some of the dialogue changes one change that i embrace is ian mcdiarmids hologram image as emperor palpatine in the empire strikes back as well as the change in dialogue it matches up better with how the emperor looked in return of the jedi and closes a hole in the original dialogue from i do however like the original emperor in the original movie as well played by an uncredited woman and voiced by clive revill the bonus material dvd is great there are several documentaries including empire of dreams the characters of star wars the birth of the light sabre and the legacy of star wars even with the three prequels being the weaker of the six movies in the saga the star wars saga is easily the most popular space adventure series of all time if youre not too picky when it comes to picture and sound quality and can handle some of the changes mostly minor that were done to these movies then i recommend this dvd set if you can still get your hands on it somewhere 
in the th grade we read a novelization of the empire strikes back at school afterwards we were treated to the movie on vhs i watched the star wars trilogy many times on vhs and my siblings and i saw the re release of the star wars trilogy special edition this dvd set is worth the money and it deserves space in your dvd collection everything from starcrash to battle beyond the stars to the original battlestar galactica have tried to emulate it star wars episode iv a new hope luke skywalker obi wan kenobi and han solo try to rescue kidnapped princess leia they must also destroy the death star a diabolical weapon that can destroy planets star wars episode v the empire strikes back the rebels are on the run from imperial troops luke skywalker meets jedi master yoda for the first time star wars episode vi return of the jedi han solo is frozen in carbonite and sold to jabba the hut luke and leia must travel to tatooine to rescue him the rebels still struggle to free the galaxy from the galactic empire 
compelling space saga with charismatic heroes comely heroine and superb creepy villain state of the art at the time special effects the work of a master movie maker kudos 
all star wars fans this is a dream come true all the three star wars films in on dvd boxset from a new hope to the return of the jedi also both versions too plus tons of extras join the dark side of the force and crush the rebel alliance this is a very cool boxset 
like many others who have already reviewed this set i have been a fan of star wars since the beginning i remember back when we called it plain old star wars and not star wars episode iv a new hope the earliest memory i have is going to the drive in here in phoenix arizona with my parents and seeing star wars my mom says i had a grin on my face for days we saw it many times after that and with each sequel i was there in line waiting in the heat to see them star wars is was a big part of my childhood and i have watched the original trilogy numerous times over the years so when it was finally announced that george lucas was finally allowing his original trilogy to be released on dvd i was ecstatic finally i would be able to watch the films on my favorite format and i could sell of my numerous vhs copies now i admit i was a little diappointed to find that only the special edition versions of the films would be released i myself prefer the original versions of the films but i somewhat understood why lucas wanted to add to the films i like some of the added backgrounds the improved special effects and the better sound what i dont appreciate is lucas messing with scenes that we have grown to love over the years scenes that shaped the characters into how we knew them i think you all know i am referring to the infamous han and greedo scene also i am not a fan of the added jabba scene but i still enjoy the star wars films and watch them faithfully i have since sold off all of my vhs copies of the star wars triolgy except for one that would be the set with the old versions of the film i will be holding on to that set until george has a change of heart and decides to do the right thing and release the original versions of the films but until that time i am happy to have them on dvd any way i can get them they look great sound great and the bonus disc included in this set has some great documentaries lucas really put a lot into this set and for that i am thankful there are those out there who like to refer to fans like myself as star wars geeks well i am more than happy to have that title because to me star wars is a big part of who i am and i would not deny that for anything may the force be with you always 
people say that if you already own the previous box set why bother with this one the answer is simple if you view it from the point of a person who likes to pretend bad sequel prequels dont exist then it makes a lot more sense to buy this this is the set for anyone who wants nothing to do with the special editions that add unnecessary cgi or digitally add jar jar and hayden christiansin to ruin good movies bare bones original no cgi just puppets and practical effects its kinda like drinking coffee black you get the full taste add to much of anything else and it becomes milk bottom line if you dont own or even if you do own the previous set toss it out and buy this one 
i havent noticed a huge difference between my memories of vhs and this blu ray but lets face it its been over a decade since i saw the classic star wars movies the movies are definitely dated at this point but if you were a star wars fan before i dont see how you could possibly be disappointed with the fact that they made it clearer i am disappointed that theres not the older version with the ewok party and song but hey cant have everything in life perfect keepsake for indoctrinating i mean enlightening all those friends who were deprived of basking in star wars as kids 
only a few words is the best of modern scifi cinema 
i love star wars and am anxiously waiting for the trilogy release for the people who feel that mr lucas has changed already superb films i respect your opinions i agree that the originals are plenty good just as they are one thing they are mr lucas films if he wants to use new technology to change his films thats his right as consumers we have the right to buy or not buy the product i am looking forward to these movies 
i bought this for my year old son who loves star wars i grew up watching these in the s and recently watched them on vhs tapes i bought these dvds and they are wonderful clear picture sound etc im not sure what some of the bad reviews or complaints are about if you want the star wars trilogy to watch at home this is perfect 
while im not terribly happy with the changing of some events in the movies most of them are minor and dont affect the overall story i would have to say this is one of the best dvd sets so far this is the set that i bought a dvd player for in the first place now that i get to hear it in and see the picture in amazing clarity i am a happy camper as for the changes now greedo and han shoot at the same time which isnt too bad there is different dialogue with the emperor in empire but that seems to be more consistent with the current star wars movies not sure why lucas added haydyn christensen unless it was for consistency sake again although if there is some other reason its pretty silly because obiwan is old and he didnt change him overall though this was an awesome job 
like many of you this is where my life long love of movies began i first saw the original star wars in theaters when i was years old since then i owned the thx vhs widescreen editions the vhs special editions the laserdisc original edition and the dvd special edition therefore as a die hard movie fan and an obsessive star wars fan i make the following plea to george lucas nestled in his orbiting thx space station george dont screw this one up whenever you finally release the original star wars trilogy on blu ray and whatever your legal muppets decide to charge for it it must include at a minimum the original unaltered star wars trilogy color and artifact corrected and remastered in gorgeous p hd the sound track should be a dolby true hd remix of the original soundtracks we dont want to see greedo shooting first we dont want to see gay annoying cgi robots we dont want to see jabbas disco dance party if you want to include the special editions and other extras as bonus content thats fine well accept that but we will not accept any attempt to withhold an hd transfer of the original unaltered star wars trilogy on blu ray once again george dont screw this one up 
star wars is one of the best movies of all time now i know the orginal trilogy wont be out on dvd until but its worth the wait i hope george lucas put the orginal version and the special edition versions of star wars the empire strikes back and return of the jedi on dvd also there is a lot of orginal making of documentarys and the original trailers 
i am neither old school or new school militant star wars geek for those of us though who repeatedly watched star wars over and over in in movie theaters who sat in line at am the first day when empire strikes back was released and then once again when return of the jedi was released there was a magic to those movies at the time that has stayed with us all these years when the special editions were released in the movie theater i will never forget sitting there and hearing the music in a movie theater reading the words scroll up on a big screen once again i was nine years old all over again and it was again the movies looked great sounded great and empire strikes back blew me away all over again the couple added scenes that he directed didnt bother me and for the most part all the new special effects were great jarring to be sure for those of us who have seen the three movies hundreds of times but it looked good i wont bother to bring up the old argument han shot first change its pointless to be honest the only part that really irritated me was at the end of return of the jedi instead of this small celebration with those who survived the battle on endor and the admittedly cheezy but classic song lucas had to show the whole empire celebrating with fireworks etc and added new music over the old which to this day if i watched the video i would turn it off because it is just so annoying what it comes down to is that lucas has forgotten one thing the most important and only thing that matters in movies to us who love them especially star wars as we sat in theaters in star wars was magical to us his obessive changing scenes switching scenes adding new special effects etc doesnt make any one of the three movies better just because you can change something doesnt mean you should now he changes the movies again ill reserve judgement when i watch all dvds a week from tuesday what lucas does now he does only for himself its his way of telling all of us star wars fans that made him the rich in the first place that he can do what he wants with his movies this is true they are his movies but along the way he forgot what made them magical in the first place the star wars trilogy is finally gonna be out on dvd of course im gonna be at the store pounding on the glass for the doors to open ill run home and pop them in the dvd player one at a time watching them with friends ill watch them over and over and over hey george lucas may have forgotten about the magic but whatever he changes or doesnt change everytime i hear the music and watch the words scroll up on my screen its again and lucas will never be able to kill that magic 
i remember being about or years old when i saw my first star wars movie in the early s i also remember running to the back of the theater screaming when darth vader appeared on the screen mother had to come get me as i was trying to hide behind a poor couples seats now i am years old and had the chance to see the digital re makes and upgrades that george lucas did over the years plus his legendary prequels over that same time the news about lucas films digitizing everything including the first movies around the time episode i was released only intensified the fervor of star wars mania some years later now that i am a respectable and employed adult i decided to drop my cash on this fine trilogy as i wanted the first movies for my home set i knew what i was getting into these are not the original releases for me i prefer that because watching s and s technology is not as appealing to me as s technology and besides these movies now tell a better story as a result of george lucas upgrades so let me review the darn package after all that now for about you get three movies and a bonus disc that means each disc will cost you a little more than each together if you are wondering if the bonus disc is worth i would give an emphatic yes the disc chronicles the making of the movie and all the side business the science of creating the movie and actors directors etc viewpoints on the whole thing it lasts over minutes and every drop of information will rile even the slightest star wars fans next on the question of digitization the three films episodes not only had a slick digital transfer making them compatible with todays machinery and offering the capability to excel over yesteryear but they revamped certain scenes that could have used the facelift for example now the speeder coming into the mos eisley spaceport doesnt look like it was a carousel it actually looks futuristic in its movement also they replaced anikan skywalker with hayden christensen instead of the original fellow when his ghost looks upon luke at the end of return of the jedi that was the best addition change i think i like action adventure movies so the digital upgrades lucas did are welcomed by me i know there are purists out there but they tend to follow a religion more than the excitement of the movie reminds me of people who do not like the designated hitter in baseball now that i think about it but i digress to close i recommend the purchase of this trilogy if you were in my situation you didnt have any of these movies and i mean the digitized versions get them the old ones are collectibles but if you want a completed collection to show your kids this trilogy fills the gaps and the bonus disc is worth it as well also if you can beat per disc individually to complete your collection id say go that route instead though you may have to forego the bonus disc 
i know a lot of folks are deeply upset that lucasfilm put out the original trilogy which included even more changes than the special editions of the late s and then later made a new boxset with the un tampered with films knowing that star wars enthusiasts like myself would not be able to say no true but i just sold my boxset and my individual prequel films and opted for these two new sets which take up much less space and look fantastic in any dvd collection its nice to see the correct snow cave scene in tesb and enjoy the true jabbas dancer scene not to mention the absolute superiority of the original return of the jedi ending none of the se or changes were necessary the only possible exception being the hologram scene featuring ian mcdiarmid which i do enjoy but if you prefer the new revisions those films are also included you still get beautiful menu screens and nice covers although more extras never hurt anyone 
those who have the trilogy on vhs and have thus watched them to the point of meltdown obviously understand the need for a reliable medium such as dvd not to mention superior sound environment bonus features commentary etc this is too good to pass up despite all of us knowing the excessive marketing ploys excercised by lucas and gang im not gonna get bent out of shape expecting potentially radical changes to cinematography and the exploitation of the resources he now has in his hands as compared to some odd twenty five to thirty years ago anyone who is buying this knows how the films went and what he or she enjoyed about them these dvds will give me the chance to watch something new from the original releases its no secret george embraces film technology so much he often will neglect the drama and or story in favor of pushing the visual envelope i would rather see what he can do to improve an already classic and familiar trilogy than resort to watching episodes and 
the original trilogy presented in widescreen i know blu ray has since come and trumped this set but for the price it is nice to add to collection 
about time i loved the movies all i want are the movies i dont care about the bonus dvd or xtras to find out how they did certain things just takes some of the magic away for me if you know how a magician does a trick then it is not so special anymore also i really dont care how the cast or crew felt about certain things i just watch for the entertainment and enjoyment 
for the same reason i knew that hardcore fans would slam the changes made to the original movies upon their re realease into the theatres i knew that fans would hate the prequels because they would never live up to the citizen kane like bar they had set i knew fans would have negative critiques of this latest dvd release bottom line these are changes that lucas wanted lucas has said over and over again that the changes that he has made have moved the films closer to his vision of the star wars universe these movies are his life project not ours as fans we should appreciate any revisions he makes to bring the movies closer to what he originally envisioned if you want garbled color bleeding ear straining versions of the films check ebay if you want crips picture and remastered sound check out this version 
with revenge of the sith in cinemas the final chapter in the sw saga has been widely recognized as the best of the prequels but still lacks the special touch that these classic films have george lucas thx was cool american graffiti showed real talent and star wars a new hope is generally regarded as the greatest movie ever made why well whats not to like from the opening shot of the blockade runner accompanied by that great theme tune by john williams you know youre in the unique world of the star wars universe before georges lackluster prequels the phantom menace and attack of the clones a new hope was known only as star wars audiences had never seen anything so original and amazing now the series has entered into the fanboy culture all over the world in comparison episode seems somewhat tame compared to revenge of the sith in terms of action but its still superior in terms of story and acting talent and now that rots has finished the saga it has to be said that these films despite being made or so years ago they still stand up today and the new generation of kids love these movies from hero luke skywalkers symbolic journey from his home tatooine to the moment of victory at the finale we are greeted with a myriad of fantastic characters especially han solo played by a pre indy harrison ford and his buddy chewbacca and the ultimate incarnation of evil darth vader and that more than anything is what made tpm so hollow while the action was impressive in parts the lack of good characters is disappointing but rots has regained much of the sense of adventure that this film started off lucas grand vision illuminates the entire film with inventive creatures and events several scenes that are my favorites are obi wans conversation to luke about the clone wars and vader solos disposal of greedo obi wan and vaders last confrontation and the battle of yavin one of my all time favorite films star wars is the great adventure directed by irvin kershner the empire strikes back moved away from the high spirited antics of the first film and took a step towards the dark side the empire is preparing to seek revenge on the rebel alliance c p gets blasted to bits and luke skywalker finds out that darth vader is his dad even john williams score is much darker in tone than his previous efforts but the film is an excellent adventure that many fans consider to be superior to the original mark hamill returns as luke carrie fisher as princess leia and harrison ford as the sardonic han solo and we are introduced to the wise yoda who trains luke about the ways of a jedi the action ante is upped considerably with fantastic chases through asteroid fields battles between snow speeders and the at ats and lukes rescue mission and the bespin duel where the confrontational battle between vader and luke ends with one of the most shocking revelations in movie history even if its somewhat un surprising for future fans who watch all the completed films in sequence the weakest of the return of the jedi starts off with luke and leia rescuing han solo from the crime lord jabba the hutt while the film is less exciting than its counterparts it does have some good action including the rescue on the desert skiff the speeder chase through the forest of endor the dark final battle between darth vader emperor palpatine and luke and the destruction of the second death star the lightsaber fights are some of the best in the star wars cannon and princess leia is hotter than ever john williams score is even more exciting than esb if i were to place the star wars films in order from best to worst they would go the empire strikes back a new hope return of the jedi revenge of the sith attack of the clones and the phantom menace this presentation is very impressive with added scenes and improved sfx i like that temuera morrisons lines are dubbed over the original boba fett lines and ian mcdiarmid in empire is satisfying the digital touch up is excellent and the dvd extras are exhaustive and impressive especially the making of documentary watching these movies one wonders what happened to lucas talent 
what can i say about the geatest movie of all time george lucas is a genius and star wars is one of his best accomplishments you never can get tired of the action adventure and thrill of the first star wars movie who can forget the wit and arrogance of our dear captain solo or the chill darth vader sends running down our spines these characters are relics of their time and they should never be forgotten i highly reccomend that you purchase this timeless movie to share with generations of old and new i know im a die hard star wars fan and deep down i think we all are may the force be with you always 
forget the prequels these are the films to watch these were the films that ignited a science fiction craze that continues over three decades later good vs evil heroes and villains and a heroine with spunk robots that elicit humor and incredible battle scenes and deep human emotion lucas can retouch them with new and better sfx but the basic wonderful films are there for me the best will always remain the empire strikes back a must for any sci fi library funny when you realize this came about because lucas couldnt get the rights to do flash gordon luke skywalker han solo princess lia obi wan kenobi darth vader classic characters for the ages a young man who becomes a man and goes the path his father could not follow a star wandering rogue who grows to be a hero an evil villain who in the end finds his humanity it doesnt get much better than this 
its too bad that dvd technology is not such that we can simply choose to watch the films with or without the changes in any case lucas changes dont spoil my viewing star wars granted i would have preferred the original but ill forgive the creator of star wars for his indulgence that said im thoroughly pleased with the picture and sound quality i loved the bonus features especially the feature on the production of episode iv it was great seeing the casting calls and watching some of the famous actors and actresses of the time trying out for the various parts 
every star wars fan desires to have some memorabilia that will help remind them of the good ole days what better piece than the movies themselves with added bonuses here are the shows that started us all on a voyage through good and evil whether we will give in to the dark side or triumph as great jedi knights one to own 
there are a mind boggling number of reviews already available on star wars so this will be brief at the time of this writing this blu ray set is listed by amazon as star wars the original trilogy episodes iv vi however the actual title on the spine of the box is simply star wars iv v vi the word original as used by amazon is ambiguous you might think these are copies of the first three theatrical releases of the star wars trilogy but they are not these are the upgraded versions of episodes iv v and vi it appears the purpose of amazons use of the word original is simply to distinguish the first star wars trilogy iv v and vi from the second star wars trilogy the prequel set of episodes i ii and iii picture blu ray to measured aspect ration subtitles english espanol francais nederlands portugues suomi svenska norsk and dansk 
all right im as nutty a star wars fan as youll ever find i still have all my toys i spent significant time and money as an adult making my own boba fett costume and still seek out those star wars rarities on e bay that being said i must say that while im not a huge fan of the majority of lucas changes to the trilogy many of them are the result of what has occurred in ep i and ii and probably iii ep iv v and vi are now part of this larger saga the funny thing is that most of the people who are complaining sobbing and threatening the life of george lucas were most likely peeing their pants in anticipation of ep i and ii then when they saw that ep i which was god awful i must admit and ii which isnt nearly as bad as everyone likes to make it out to be were not carbon copies of the original trilogy they declared their god lucas dead and mourned the loss of their lifes purpose i cant believe im saying this but these are just movies they should not be your reason for being if you want to go a step further and call them the closest thing we have to a modern mythos im with ya but to not recognize that without many of these changes the full story would become very confusing and disjointed is to reject the mythos entirely if thats what youre willing to do then i submit you are not a fan of star wars but more a fan of your own conception of what star wars is or was this is what we have to deal with this is star wars from jar jar puke to boba fett this is what you have to accept as the full star wars package besides isnt there something kind of cool about seeing something for the billionth time and seeing something new look i can definitely do without the jabba scene in docking bay jabba youre a wonderful human being what the hell is that that doesnt even make sense and i can definitely do without the retarded dance scene in jedi but to scrap the whole thing because its not exactly how you remembered it when you saw it for the first time is just ridiculous if you have been waiting years to see iv v and vi on dvd in crystal clear color and brilliant sound buy this set if you refuse to accept that the trilogy is now just a part of a larger world stick w the crappy vhs copies and play them to your hearts content or until they snap you will pay the price for your lack of vision 
yes but i was pretty surprised to see the new anakin at the end of episode i had not intend to watch the whole double trilogy is there a word for a movie suite right away i was waiting to get episode on dvd but couldnt wait i guess my wife had never seen any of the star wars movies which was good now because when episodes and came out she started watching them last week we watched them again on dvd as a refresher and a couple of days ago we watched episode in the theater that same night we watched episode last night episode and tonight we just finished in a way it makes sense to see the new anakin at the end of episode especially if you watch all in a week or so however they could and should give us the opportunity to buy the original trilogy the way it was and from what ive seen with other reviewers i am definitely not the only one whod buy them again as they had been released over years ago the music changed too i remember listening to the ewok song at the end of but they removed it dont get me wrong i like the new ones too i just wish they had the original available as well surely mr lucas doesnt want us to hang on to the old video tapes ironically the star wars trilogy on vhs are the last video tapes i own everything else has gone to dvd if they dont release the good old ones on dvd i guess ill just have to burn them myself on dvd r now if mr lucas wants the money he can simply release the originals dont need to fix anything add anything remove anything just transfer them to dvd if he wants the fans to get what they want and dont really care about the money then he should listen to them otherwise theyll just burn their own copies on dvd from vhs or ld in other words give the fans the choice you want the new one fine you prefer the old ones fine too 
here are all the changes a new hope visual changes the rerelease version is the exact same as the version plus the title insertion and the dialogue change in the version there was no title episode iv a new hope but when the film was rereleased in the title was added the shot of r d wandering down the canyon alone now has a different background the scene where the imperial storm troopers find r d and c pos escape pod has now been extended and the dewbacks are now cgi the binary sunset was given a strange blur in the versions this has been corrected by the version the sandcrawler shots have alternate angles and look much more detailed obi wans home has an alternate view the view of mos eisley has been revamped and looks much more detailed the landspeeder shot entering mos eisley is much more detailed the first mos eisley scene has been extended with cgi monsters walking around this scene looks much livelier now mos eisley is now a bustling spaceport in the version one of the characters in the cantina bar orginally looked like a wolf in the versions he now looks like a lizard the most controversial change is the greedo scene did you know that one deleted in the phantom menace was a scene with anakin fighting a young greedo anyway this scene had greedo shoot first unfortunately the die hard purists dreaded this change i dont like it either in the version han solo just blasted greedo in the versions greedo shot and missed han solo and then he blasted greedo but in the version they shoot almost at te same time and in the version they clearly did not shoot at the same time the entirely new scene that wasnt in the version was the jabba scene who is entirely cgi but the cgi is different in the version the doors on the death star open close slower in the versions the millenium falcon departure from tatooine is different a different alderaan explosion the scene where the millenium falcon gets pulled into the death star has a new effect shot after obi wan says its an imperial fighter lukes lightsaber now has color during his training aboard the millenium falcon the blaster bolts have been censored to not show the impact in the versions the perspective background of the cell block corridor has now been corrected the eye of the dianogah now blinks version change only the writing on the tractor beam controls is now aurabesh instead of english version change the scene where han solo chases the imperial storm troopers away and then he runs into hundreds of them instead of just a few for the versions during the obi wan darth vader fight the lightsabers have been corrected in all shots in some shots in the versions it looks like two people fighting with sticks version change after obi wan is gone darth vaders lightsaber color has been corrected version change the shot of the millenium falcon flying under yavin has been changed in the version the millenium falcon files directly under yavin and in the versions it files more to the right of yavin and with more movement when the millenium falcon lands on yavin we now see the millenium falcon land as opposed to the version where we saw nothing in a new scene luke meets up with his pal biggs the launch has been changed instead of lights going up into the sky we now see the x wings clearly flying away and yavin is less visible as opposed to the version where yavin was clearly visible the approach to the death star has been radically changed with more x wings y wings approaching and the ships look much more detailed during the battle of yavin the second shot after the leader says im going to try and cut across and try and draw their fire has a alternate view of the now cgi x wings the battle of yavin has been given a computer enhanced makeover and alternate shots the first is right after biggs says to luke hes on me tight i cant shake him that is an alternate shot and the second is a reverse angle of wedge antilles destroying a tie fighter and going through the explosion the death star expolsion is much bigger a new hope sound dialogue changes when the sandcrawler stops there is new dialogue said by c po versions to r d wake up wake up version were stopped to r d wake up wake up when obi wan kenobi scares off the tusken raiders his scream is different in the versions this call sounded suspciously like a dewback scream in the version this sounded like a krayt dragon while the stormtroopers are searching the millenium falcon a line of dialogue is added which is theres no one here after a imperial officer says tk why arent you at your post there is a new effect when luke taps his helmet to signal the officer but this effect is extremely hard to make out when the stormtroopers go into the room where r d and c po are hiding and one of the stormtroopers hits his head on the door and the version added a little oomph to the effect the sound of princess leias blaster sound like a real blaster in the versions but sounded like a magnum in the version while running from the storm troopers all dialogue said by princess leia and luke skywalker sounded like an unconvicing echo in the version but sounds like a more convincing echo in the version when han and chewbacca escape through the blast doors the version did not have a line of dialogue that the versions did and it is close the blast doors the music on the start in the battle of yavin is inaudible in the version but clearly audible in the versions the line hes on your tail was inserted for the version but removed again for the version during the battle of yavin when a tie fighter is on luke different dialogue is said versions blast it biggs where are you rerelease version blast it wedge where are you the empire strikes back visual changes in the version when luke and his tauntaun are captured by the wampa you never really see the wampa only hear it in the versions the wampa was given a complete makeover and new shots of the wampa eating the tauntaun were added and another shot of the right armless wampa was inserted during the hoth battle a black line on the edge of lukes speeder window has been removed for the versions when darth vader communicates with the emperor the versions the emperor was voiced by clive revill and the version was voiced played by ian mcdarmid the version of the emperor has minor changes the emperors eyes have been replaced by chimpanzee eyes boba fetts pursuit is different in all three versions in the version the slave i was chasing the millenium falcon form a more far away angle in the version there is another shot added and the angle has been reversed in the version the same angle as the version is used and the added shot for the version has been reversed the versions give a lot better view of cloud city by adding cgi shots of the millenium falcon flying through the city the shot of cloud city from a distance is different in the version there is a cloud car and no tibanna gas refinery in the versions there is no cloud car and there is a tibanna gas refinery in the version there is only one shot of exterior cloud city before we see princess leia and han solo talking about lando calrssian in the versions there are several more shots of exterior cloud city when lando calrissian escorts han leia and chewie in the versions there are now windows that you can now see exterior cloud city through another shot of windows was added also just when han is about to be frozen into carbonite in the versions it looks like han is wearing a sleeveless jacket in the version this has been corrected in the luke skywalker darth vader lightsaber battle darth vaders lightsaber is red in all shots in the versions and in the version darth vaders lightsaber is red in some shots and pink in others the versions added more shots of lando telling people to get out of the city the version added a new scene in which darth vader after failing to seduce luke into the dark side of the force was walking back to the shuttle the versions have a hatch to when lando rescues luke who is hanging from a metal antenna above the skies as opposed to the version where there was no hatch and a white glare the scene when admrial piett delivers a report to darth vader on the bridge of darth vaders ship has corrected the placement of the imperial insignias for the version there is a new scene for the versions of darth vaders shuttle flying to the imperial super star destroyer two of these shots are outtakes from return of the jedi because the man who walks with darth vader is not admiral piett its moff jejerrod commander of the second death star the empire strikes back sound dialogue changes when luke is brought back to the hidden rebel base new dialogue is said version c po master luke its so good to see you fully functional again versions c po master luke its so good to see you fully functional again luke thanks threepio in the hoth battle there is an extra line of dialogue for the version in the version lukes mouth can be seen moving but no words are said version luke stay tight and low wedge aaahhh versions luke stay tight and low this is it wedge aaahhh right before the tie fighters have been destroyed c po says and extra line of dialogue version oh this is suicide versions oh this is suicide theres nowhere to go when darth vader and the emperor were communicating via hologram ian mcdiarmid re recorded all of the emperors dialogue and some lines were altered for the version in the versions boba fetts dialogue was voiced by jason wingreen but for the version all of boba fetts dialogue has been rerecorded but not altered and voiced by temuera morrison who plays jango fett in attack of the clones right after r d gets spit out by the river monster in dagobah one of lukes lines has been completely altered version are you all right come on helps r d up uhhh you were lucky to get out of there versions are you all right come on helps r d up uhhh you were lucky you didnt taste so good this is by far the best change for the version in the version when luke fell a scream was added and this sounded exactly like the one when the emperor got thrown down the shaft by darth vader in return of the jedi in the versions there is no scream when darth vader goes to his shuttle his dialogue has been changed version bring my shuttle versions alert my star destroyer to prepare for my arrival return of the jedi visual changes this is the worst change for return of the jedi in the version the max rebo band max rebo is the blue elephantine thing pipe player droopy mccool and singer sy snootles are playing the song lapti nek in the version this scene is almost entirely diiferent sy snootles is now completely cgi and she has been given a cgi companion named joh yowza together they sing jedi rocks which is so bad it seems out of place the version is the same as the version but also han solo carbonite encased form is not on the wall the sail barges movements and shadow were almost unnatural in the version this has been corrected for the versions the rancor sequence had that black line on the rancor in the version as you saw on the window of lukes speeder in the version of the empire strikes back that has been removed for the versions the sarlacc has been greatly changed in the version the sarlacc is a sarlacc pit that looked pretty boring with only tentancles in the versions the sarlacc is now a sarlacc beast and has tentacles with a cgi birdlike beak in the version during the sarlacc sequence when han solo was hanging from one of the smaller barges he was hanging by just his toes with chewbacca holding him in the versions han is hanging by his toes with a rope around them and chewbacca holding him the speeder bike chase has added shots from the back for the versions in the first part of the luke skywalker darth vader lightsaber fight darth vaders lightsaber is red in the versions in the version it is pink lukes lightsaber is also washed out in the version incredibly the version in which the lightsabers look best is the version because the version of the lightsabers are too bright and the versions are too dull when luke unmaskes darth vader anakin skywalker he has eyebrows in the versions and in the version he does not have eyebrows and his eyes were colored to match hayden christensens eyes the destruction of the death star ii is larger in the versions the version of the celebration scene had a panoramic view of the ewok village on endor and the ewoks play their yub nub song for the versions a lot of digital ewoks have been added and the song has been changed the versions have more scenes of the ewoks and the rebels celebrating this is the worst change in the entire trilogy the anakin yoda and obi wan spirit shots were all the same in the versions in the version sebastian shaw has been replaced with hayden christensen i was so shocked to see this change i nearly had a heart attack a new scene with oola a green dancer has been added for the versions a shot of banthas has been added right before the jabbas barge shot for the versions before the ewok celebrations a number of celebrations have now been added with one of cloud city then tatooine then naboo version only then coruscant but there is a change between the couruscant shots of the versions in the version the jedi temple is standing and in the version there is no jedi temple and there is another difference this one is tough to see but the senate buliding has been added for the version return of the jedi audio changes during the sarlacc sequence there is different dialogue before han shoots one of the tentacles of the sarlacc version han solo dont move lando lando calrissian oh wait i thought you were blind han solo its all right trust me lando calrissian a little higher just a little higher versions han solo dont move lando lando calrissian oh wait i thought you were blind han solo its all right i can see a lot better lando calrissian a little higher just a little higher dvd ratings video there is no argument that this is the best all three films have ever looked of all three versions audio and there is no argument this is the best these films have ever sounded of all three versions extras lots of extras inculding the hour documentary the empire of dreams the star wars story film ratings star wars orginial theatrical version without title episode iv a new hope rerelease version with added title episode iv a new hope special edition dvd version the empire strikes back theatrical version special edition dvd version return of the jedi theatrical version special edition dvd version conclusion highly recommended box set and these are the only versions of the classic films that will ever be available and im serious the orginial versions will never be available on dvd im bummed about that as they said on the preview before the movie presentation on the vhs get it again for the last time 
but the blue ray does have such phenomenal quality to it even i who has watched these movies so many times i lost count stopped and starred when my son had it playing 
this addition is a bit of a tease its a nice collectors item however the episode footage is poor and doesnt give you anything we have not seen already i hate to say it but its an easy way to make money if course i bought it for my collection star wars is a great movie and the box is very nice too dont buy it if your expecting something new 
i just want to clear one thing up right here and now regardless of what anyone else says the theatrical original versions are included with these movies on disc of each movie i know they are the unchanged original versions from before lucas changed them and not because i have a great memory im from the s after all but i played the dvd version and my original vhs version at the same time side by side and they played in sync throughout the entire movie second for second if there were any changes made then one of the movies running would have fallen out of sync my versions are from way before lucas changed them and added new parts you should be able to find these versions included with these best buy tin versions on the normal paper box set disc versions also as long as they are from or beyond the vhs version looks alot worse than the dvd could ever look the dvd looks great however in my opinion the sound on the vhs is clearly superior to the dvd its much louder and the stereo separation is much more defined there is also a touch of extra re verb in the sound on the vhs which gives it a movie theater feel anyway let the debates continue and may the force be with you 
it is rather juvenile to have all the star wars fanboys bashing lucas for tweaking the original trilogy the newly released versions of these three great films on dvd is simply astounding and beyond my wildest hopes the restoration is a work of technological genius obviously star wars has been a work in progress since nobody knew whether lucas would be able to do any more of these films and so the first one was deliberately set in the middle of the story at the most exciting part yet filmed as a one shot when it became obvious that the box office success of the film would allow lucas to make two more episodes he made his first tweak with the original film by rereleasing it in as episode iv nobody complained about that it was a work in progress and it still is though the phantom menace was clearly billed as episode i most star wars fans refused to see it that way but instead looked at it with blinders on the first part of any story rarely achieves the same level of drama or action as the final parts the contention that lucas couldnt make the films that he envisioned in is evidenced by the existence of unfinished scenes such as the one from the film featuring harrison ford talking to a non existent jabba the scene was never finished because of costs other scenes were not possible because the fx technology simply did not exist such as depicting corruscant casting ian mcdiarmid as palpatine in episode vi was a brilliant decision and hopefully in episode iii most fans will recognize how brilliant an actor mcdiarmid is to have first played a later version of a character then as an older man to play an earlier version of that same character lastly some fx shots simply had to be redone some people may wince at the additions i for one always winced when they showed the cheesy scene of alderaan blowing up in but have you seen it on the dvd wow it is simply marvelous to watch a new hope the way it was originally intended to be shot and it will be even more incredible to watch all six episodes together when episode iii is completed to get a feel for what that experience might be like watch the larson home scene on the episode ii dvd and then take a look at the same set as it appears at the beginning of episode iv on dvd this will give you a greater appreciation for the level of detail and consistency lucas is bringing to the entire series its marvelous as for somebodys comment that darth vader only appears in two minutes of episode iii dont you realize how long two minutes is watch any star wars movie and watch your clock youd be amazed at how much story is covered and how many different characters appear in just seconds im already having a greater appreciation for the phantom menace now that we have at least episodes presented the way they were meant to be seen and on dvd in widescreen the phantom menace is a wonderful beginning visually spectacular george lucas has given us a wonderful modern mythology even joseph campbell recognized this fact although the mystical elements of star wars get overlooked its hard to imagine how anyone could not see the analogy between history or for that matter current events regarding how a republic turns into an evil empire this compelling epic saga is the brilliant vision of one man george lucas anybody that cant see this cannot see the forest for the trees future generations wont give a crap about what the fanboys here are whining about they will see all episodes consecutively as they were meant to be shown and ill admit star wars is still a work in progress something tells me lucas isnt finished yet i cant wait until he replaces all those damn ewoks with more interesting cge creatures please thank you george 
the star wars trilogy is finally out on dvd and george lucas tinkered some more with it just be glad he didnt replace yoda with the cgi version from episode ii and iii first of all lets start with the movies a new hope the first ever star wars movie is easily the best its just an old fashioned fairy tale you have the innocent hero in luke skywalker the evil villain in darth vader even though the prequels will change all that the damsel in distress albeit one who will kick some ass before shes done in princess leia and so on and so forth the cast gives memorable performances but its the visual effects that steal the show and also get the oscar i did not see star wars until the re release so i really have no problem with some of the tinkerings courtesy of george lucas the one noticeable tinkering on this dvd that i have no problem with is the fixing up of jabba the hutt who was barely recognizable in the re release the empire strikes back another amazing movie probably better than the first star wars more memorable characters more amazing special effects and of course more tinkerings i actually dont have a problem with the addition of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor hologram or temuera morrison rerecording boba fetts lines it helps to keep the trilogy consistent with the prequels return of the jedi this movie pulls out all the stops even though it is a bit more excessive than its toned down predecessors the biggest tinkering that i do have a problem with is the substitution of sebastian shaw by hayden christiansen that just made me go huh all in all they are amazing films and will forever be land marks in the history of film unfortunately these changes mean that future viewers may end up watching the prequels first but as long as star wars is in our lives all is right with the universe may the force be with you 
the original star wars is to this day one of the greatest sci fi films of all time when it was released in no other sci fi film came close in comparison to the quality and advancement in special effects technology that this film presented star wars set the standard by which all other sci fi films are judged to this day as for the plot many critics like to say that people continue to watch and enjoy star wars to recapture lost youth theyre wrong because we remain young at heart and idealistic about the future we love films such as star wars that promote the hope of a better tomorrow when so many other things in real life have failed films such as star wars ignite the imagination and encourage mankind to reach for the stars maybe its the critics who need to recapture their youth and idealism both of which appear to be dead and forgotten my thanks to george lucas mark hamill harrison ford carrie fisher alec guiness and the many other cast and crew that brought this remarkable film to life for countless generations to enjoy 
absolutely brilliant brings the old trilogy back to life with the two disc sets high quality perfect purchase be sure to also buy the prequel trilogy packaged the same way have all at a great price 
how is it possible that i have now bought the exact same well almost movies on video tape for now the fourth time yes im one of those people who own the original letterbox release the letterbox thx release and the letterbox special edition box set now as soon as mr lucas announces yet another marketing of the holy trilogy im there with my credit card on amazon com heck i dont even buy video cassettes anymore i have a dvd player why do i keep shelling out hard earned dollars for the same movies well if you really need to ask that question youre obviously not a star wars fan without a doubt there movies have become immortal for one reason they have ressurected the myth genre while the greeks and romans had their famous mythologies aesop had his fables and the britsh had king arthur the last generation of the th century has star wars we were raised on star wars dreams of becoming a jedi were as common as future proffessions such as doctor or policeman back at my grade school i doubt a day went by between my fourth and tenth years of life where the accolades of luke leia han chewie r and po werent acted out in my daily play with my friends we didnt play quot cowboys and indians quot we played quot rebels and imperials quot we didnt have gun fights we battled each other with whatever could substitute for a lightsaber in retrospect now that im all grwon up im thankful for lucas for what he gave me these movies laid of a simple play of good versus evil in the end the quest for virtue will always triumph over the greed of evil they also taught me that if you believe in yourself and have faith a higher power you can accomplish anything for this you will see me ordering this trilogy every time it is released not just for the quot episode ii behind the scenes quot stuff but basically to give the well worn copies i already own a break thank you mr lucas youve brought great joy into my life and helped to teach me the values i have today though i dont have children yet im sure that when they come along they will be living out the same fantasies i did a long time ago in a galaxy far far away p s wheres the dvds

and future the hermits name is obi wan kenobi and he is a jedi knight obi wan explains to luke that he once fought alongside the boys father a long dead jedi named anakin skywalker that anakin was killed by a dark and twisted former jedi named darth vader and that his hope was for luke to carry on in the jedi ways obi wan teaches luke about the force an all encompassing energy field created by life itself that gives the jedi their seemingly supernatural abilities from levitation to precognition to incomparable speed and reflexes the old jedi also passes on to luke the lightsaber of his father and teaches the boy to use the jedi weapon a sword of pure energy with the power to cut through nearly anything with the greatest of ease together the aged jedi his new apprentice and the two droids embark on a mission set forth by the message carried within r d a message from princess leia organa of alderaan asking obi wan kenobi to deliver the astromech droid safely to her home planet for he also carries the secret plans that could help the rebellion destroy the evil emperors greatest weapon the death star hiring a seedy corellian pilot named han solo and his copilot chewbacca the wookie to fly them to alderaan in the starship freighter the millennium falcon luke obi wan and the droids are soon traveling through space at hyper speed doing their best to avoid the clutches of the evil empire along the way they shortly find themselves unwelcome guests in the lions den however when their search for the now non existent alderaan lands them in the heart of the death star itself a space station the size of a small moon with the fire power to destroy an entire planet with one laser blast together the small band of heroes takes the opportunity to perform a dangerous rescue mission saving the beautiful princess leia from the emperors vile henchman darth vader but not without first losing one of their own in the escape it is now up to the remaining heroes and their princess to see the vital information within r is safely delivered to the rebel alliance and that the death star is finally destroyed star wars episode v the empire strikes back it is a dark time for the rebellion luke skywalker and his friends have set up a new base on the ice planet of hoth but it is not long before their secret location is discovered by the evil empire after narrowly surviving an attack by a wampa snow beast luke and the rebels must flee the invading imperial forces but not without putting up a fight first what follows is a fantastic battle between snowspeeders and huge legged walking machines called at ats a necessary defensive in order to allow the large rebel transports to get away in the mayhem of escape however the tight knit group of friends han solo chewbacca princess leia organa c po r d and of course luke skywalker must divide while struggling to survive in the harsh snow of hoth luke had earlier received a visitation from the spirit of his old teacher obi wan kenobi instructing him to go to the dagobah system and seek out a jedi master called yoda to continue his training with r as his co pilot luke departs hoth in his x wing fighter for the mysterious destination while leia is forced to escape with han chewie and po in the millennium falcon a ride she is less than pleased to take as luke makes his way to the strange swampy planet of dagobah princess leia fends off the romantic advances of intergalactic rogue han solo aboard the falcon darth vader in hot pursuit of their ship the falcons hyper drive damaged han leads the imperials into an asteroid field hoping the dangerous maneuver will cause them to give up chase but when the asteroid cave they take up residence in displays a mind and appetite of its own they are forced to come up with a new plan attaching their ship to the hull of darth vaders star destroyer they manage to disappear from detection by the imperial crew long enough to float away with the massive destroyers garbage discharge but legendary bounty hunter boba fett is wise to their plan and informs the empire of the falcons next destination cloud city meanwhile sith lord darth vader holds conference with his dark master the evil emperor palpatine via holographic technology together the two plot to recruit the son of anakin skywalker into their perverse household or kill him if he refuses on the eerie swamp planet of dagobah luke skywalker seeks out his new teacher in the ways of the force the elusive master yoda what he finds is a small green inquisitive creature that offers to show him the way reluctantly luke follows the aged little alien only to be baffled by the discovery that this creature is the jedi master himself after some convincing by the spirit of obi wan kenobi yoda agrees to take on the padawan learner under his instruction luke begins to learn the intricacies of the force the differences between the dark and the light and the mastery of his new force given powers most importantly luke learns the dangers of being seduced by the dark side of the force and the ease with which such a transformation can take place as the millennium falcon reaches cloud city a beautiful floating gas mining colony run by han solos old friend lando calrissian they are greeted by some none too friendly security skiffs this is no comfort to the already concerned little band of rebels who are not exactly at ease about what sort of friend lando calrissian may turn out to be soon enough old friends bid seemingly warm welcomes and introductions are exchanged as well lando proves to be a charming diplomat of a scoundrel as friendly as can be but more concerned about numero uno than even han solo used to be as the falcons crew will soon find out for it is not long before they are also greeted by their old nemesis darth vader han solo is soon suffering under the empires vicious means of torture all in an effort to lure luke skywalker into vaders clutches by way of telepathically sensing his friends anguish and its not just hans suffering luke senses but that of leia as well who is coming to terms with her true feelings for the falcons brave captain and the suffering of the wookie co pilot chewbacca who has devoted his life to protecting his friend and partner han solo luke is soon determined to join his friends on cloud city despite his training

before that happens the plan is for leia to free han herself that night the attempt is unsuccessful while the princess does manage to free han from his carbonite prison jabba and his cronies catch leia in the act and she soon finds herself clad in metal slave girl garb and kept on the end of a leash at jabbas side han on the other hand is locked away in the same dungeon cell his partner chewbacca is being held in the two share a bittersweet reunion as day breaks again luke skywalker arrives to take matters into his own hands but his threats upon jabba land him in the mobsters rancor pit and he is forced to exterminate the great beast this angers the hutt intensely and luke and his crew are immediately sentenced to death by sarlacc the prisoners are loaded onto a skiff and jabba and his followers board a sail barge to the pit of the sarlacc sunken within the hot desert sands of tatooine as luke skywalker is prodded onto a plank over the deadly pit an immense creature made of beak and tentacles eagerly waiting below he offers jabba one final chance to free the small group of rebels or pay the price of death this amuses jabba but the death sentence stands a signal to his loyal astromech droid r d sends a lightsaber through the air and into the waiting hands of luke skywalker who immediately takes action as leia strangles her massive hutt captor with her slave chain

battle with darth vader on cloud city yoda confirms his darkest fears darth vader is luke skywalkers father the once good and caring jedi knight anakin skywalker seduced and corrupted by the wicked emperor palpatine decades ago yoda also informs luke that only a final and successful confrontation with his father will make him a true jedi knight and stop the emperors reign of evil yoda passes away his last breath revealing the secret of one other existing skywalker child the spirit of obi wan kenobi arrives to console luke as he emerges from yodas tiny home it is obi wan lukes first jedi

revealing the truth to his long lost sibling surrenders himself to vader and the emperor in the hopes of finding the good that he still senses from deep beneath his fathers twisted black shell the future of the entire galaxy relies on the success of the rebel alliance in their separate goals and it all culminates in the final act of return of the jedi the legacy in young filmmaker george lucas changed the lives of countless young movie goers by delivering unto them star wars a swashbuckling sprawling space saga of rebellion romance and sorcery in the style of the s serials that inspired it but with visual effects and imaginative characters the likes of which the world had never seen before starring newcomers mark hamill as naive and idealistic farm boy luke skywalker harrison ford as dashing fortune seeking flyboy han solo and carrie fisher as beautiful damsel in distress princess leia along with the unforgettable voice of james earl jones as darth vader and screen legend alec guinness as obi wan kenobi star wars spun a timeless tale of familiar myth and legend in a whole new way relying on outstanding acting performances and an incomparable john williams musical score to take viewers beyond the fantastic surroundings and into the story itself drawing inspiration from the annals of film history borrowing heavily from the wizard of oz tales of king arthur and the works of akira kurosawa not to mention the history of mankind in general george lucass seemingly simple tale is so full of detail and realism even in its most unbelievable moments that the viewer easily becomes lost in the adventure thats just what star wars is an adventure a thrill ride for the young at heart in the prayers of millions of star wars fans were answered with the release of a second star wars film star wars episode the empire strikes back continuing the spectacular story of luke skywalker han solo and princess leia along with their wookie and robot friends this was a much darker chapter in the epic star wars saga it was a chapter of dark secrets heart wrenching devices and a cliff hanger ending that left many movie goers with a feeling of what the nevertheless it was a masterful piece of filmmaking that would go on to be called the best of the star wars saga by a multitude of star wars fans returning with the brilliant music of john williams and the same outstanding cast as the first film mark hamill carrie fisher harrison ford sir alec guinness david prowse peter mayhew anthony daniels kenny baker and the voice of james earl jones and introducing billy dee williams in the role of lando calrissian and a new instant fan favorite bounty hunter character known as boba fett plus the masterful puppeteering talents of muppet legend frank oz star wars creator george lucas felt safe to turn over the reigns to seasoned director irvin kershner this time around taking on the job with intense respect and vigilance kershners determination to create a worthy second act to the star wars saga resulted in cinematic excellence a rousing adventure fantasy from beginning to cliff hanger ending loaded with action effects suspense drama magnificent performances and one of the most famous and believable screen romances in movie history the empire strikes back took the star wars story to a whole new level making it so much more than we ever thought it was before then came and fans were flocking to theaters to see the rd and final film in the legendary star wars saga star wars episode return of the jedi completing the spectacular story of luke skywalker han solo princess leia chewbacca r d c po and the malevolent darth vader and the galactic empire return of the jedi proved to be a very revealing final chapter in the star wars mythology old secrets were confirmed new secrets revealed bonds were strengthened new ones were formed the world said goodbye to some beloved characters both good and evil and a band of tree dwelling teddy bears proved that all the technology in the universe isnt enough to defeat the human spirit of course the main theme of return of the jedi is the main theme of star wars itself redemption but to delve too much into that just now would probably ruin the film for those who have not yet seen it returning yet again with the brilliance of john williams and the same wonderful cast george lucas chose director richard marquand to helm the film this time around the result was another cinematic masterpiece though many fans may disagree due to a popular disdain for the lovable ewok creatures its a distaste i still dont understand but many folks simply dont like anything cute i offer up this question though in a galaxy as vast as that of star wars wouldnt some of the creatures be cute its inevitable the ewoks serve a crucial purpose regardless of the feelings of many fans they embody one of george lucass major themes in star wars the little guy cant be kept down anyway i must not be the only ewok lover the characters enjoyed a popular cartoon series in the s more popular than the droids cartoon featuring r and po and had two quite enjoyable made for tv movies return of the jedi is high on fun being thoroughly action packed and full of more bizarre creatures than any star wars film before it it also introduces us to a character only seen before in holographic form until the prequels came along that is the dark emperor himself played to fiendish perfection by ian mcdiarmid and yes its in return of the jedi that we see whats under darth vaders mask for the first time this final chapter in the star wars trilogy is not to be missed by fans of the first two films a rousing enlightening and astonishing experience from beginning to end in the star wars trilogy was rereleased to theaters for a new generation it was a rerelease that brought mixed emotions among fans due to the new additions george lucas had made to his film legacy through the magic of digital technology special effects scenes were improved deleted scenes were added with new digital characters and the films were made to fall more in line with lucass original vision which had been impossible to realize fully in the s and s george lucas was happy many fans were not however many fans had no problem with the changes and even welcomed them if awkwardly it was all a foreshadowing of what was to come now the first three chapters of the star wars saga have been released as well and the tale is complete no longer a simple tale about farm boy luke skywalker and his friends defeating an evil galactic empire but now a much deeper tale of redemption the likes of which was only emphasized before in episode return of the jedi with the long awaited dvd release of the original or classic star wars trilogy came even more improvements from creator george lucas continuing his attempt to make the six star wars films fit together as one epic story the most noticeable adjustment to the first film episode a new hope in this reviewers opinion anyway all those complaints about the greedo scene seem overblown to me and im a huge han fan is the scene where han solo converses with jabba the hutt first restored to the film with a digital jabba in the dvd release offers a new jabba in this scene one that looks considerably more like the jabba the hutt we are all familiar with while the new cgi jabba still doesnt seem quite as harmonious with the rest of the picture as such digital characters do in the prequels the whole scene is still quite an impressive feat and completely welcome as far as this fan is concerned especially with the much needed update though it kinda makes my action figure of jabba pretty pointless in the second star wars film episode the empire strikes back in addition to the previous changes which enhanced the wampa attack scene and opened up cloud city to far more glorious views the film now features changes to bring it more in line with the star wars prequels boba fetts original voice has been replaced with the voice of temuera morrison who played jango fett and the clones in the star wars prequels also the scene where darth vader converses with the holo projection of the emperor has been redone with new dialogue and the replacement of ian mcdiarmid in the role of the evil palpatine in my personal opinion the alterations that have been made to empire over the years are more than welcome especially to cloud city and while i feel for the actor who was replaced bringing back ian mcdiarmid as the emperor really ties the entire film series together quite nicely as he played the emperor in return of the jedi as well as in the prequels in truth its a change ive always longed for my only minor quibble is that replacing boba fetts voice seemed totally unnecessary and i rather prefer his original sound theres no reason to think that he wouldnt have lost his accent over the years after losing his father in episode at such a young age and the original voice was far more menacing as for the third film episode return of the jedi in addition to the changes which included an added musical number within jabbas palace improvements to the sarlacc creature and new cityscape celebrations and music in the films finale return of the jedi now features changes to meld it better with the prequels also along with improving the overall look of the rancor scene the spirit of an aged anakin skywalker in the end of the film has been quite shockingly replaced with that of a much younger anakin circa episode played by actor hayden christensen my honest response to the various changes to return of the jedi over the years im not a huge fan of the added musical sequence it seemed rather unnecessary and more cartoony than anything else in star wars the only thing that bothers me more is the two headed podrace announcer in episode that bothered me much more taking that into account i am not extremely bothered by the musical number in jedi but it was better without it i am rather pleased with the much needed adjustments to the rancor scene which was really just a matter of making the elements blend together much better than they did before the sarlacc changes are welcome by me too its definitely a more intimidating creature than it used to be when it was just a big hole in the ground with a few tentacles as for the changes that relate more to tying the prequels to the original trilogy the new elements young anakins ghost and the cities of the galaxy in celebration are excellent additions when one watches all six star wars films together however the original elements hold a place in all our hearts and this is why offering up the original films as a dvd option would have been so greatly appreciated still over all aside from only a few complaints here and there particularly the digital removal of one of my favorite characters lak sivrak aka the cantina wolf man another of my action figures that has been made obsolete i have no serious problems with the new special special editions of the star wars saga though as a hardcore fan it does seem wrong that the original versions are not also available on the dvds disney gives the option on their special editions after all each film in the classic star wars trilogy includes an audio commentary option a new hope features commentary by george lucas carrie fisher ben burtt and dennis muren empire features commentary by george lucas carrie fisher ben burtt dennis muren and director irvin kershner jedi features commentary by george lucas carrie fisher ben burtt and dennis muren the commentaries are enjoyable and can clue a viewer in on key elements but they were clearly recorded separately and one wishes that if they had to be recorded that way that we could have received the complete commentaries of the individuals rather than a single compilation track nevertheless a fun listen of course all the really great extras are on the th disc in the dvd boxed set here the highlight is the outstanding minute documentary empire of dreams an in depth look at the making of all three classic star wars films and when i say in depth i mean in depth fantastic program the bonus disc also includes three enjoyable featurettes on the characters of star wars the legacy of star wars and the birth of the lightsaber other extras include still galleries an xbox game demo a preview of star wars episode and my favorite bonus features besides the documentary the trailers and tv spots i absolutely love the teaser trailers to the films especially a new hope and empire theres a powerful s s sci fi fantasy eeriness about them i mean theyre creepy overall not a bad bonus line up but dont let your hopes get too high the bonus disc in the star wars trilogy set is painfully lacking deleted and alternate scenes the classic kenner toy commercials we grew up with you know its lando calrissian in disguise and the infamous star wars holiday special then again i guess one could come up with tons of extras that could have been included but werent that was just my wish list well see what future dvd rereleases bring regardless the star wars trilogy boxed set is a must own still three of the finest films ever made still the same powerful experience despite alterations and still as thrilling as ever empire is still as eerily transcendental as ever and oh do leias glossy

some apologists for the phantom menace not all defend it by saying yes it has its flaws but its just as good as the original star wars which had the very same flaws after a while its hard to avoid the suspicion that theyre right not about the phantom menace being a good film it is definitely not but about star wars being no better maybe weve been deluded these past decades similar delusions have persisted for just as long could it be that star wars too was an unimaginative flatly directed kiddie movie no most certainly it was not one thing the phantom menace reveals though is that star wars was not fated to be as good as it was it became great partly by accident harrison ford has genuine charm mark hamill is perfect as the innocent adolescent with a tendency to whine alec guinness needs no comment and no other female lead had the strength of carrie fischer at least not while playing a traditional princess maybe this perfect cast was assembled by sheer chance lucas never replicated the feat after all but so what its still a perfect cast they all created memorable characters and moreover as characters and actors interacted successfully with each other mos eisleys spaceport was also a fortuitous accident never will you find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy yet it managed to avoid being a thriving respectable looking town largely because george lucas didnt have the money to turn it into one and a good thing too its possibly the most frightening place in the star wars universe truly grimy light years away from real civilisation crawling with odd and touchy aliens with art direction special effects and music too george lucas struck gold has a science fantasy world ever looked better have special effects ever succeeded in making such a world look more real arguably not although this isnt what makes star wars unique nor is the music although the music is part of what makes it unique no there really is magic here it sounds a clich eacute but there is something about the simple but honestly pursued story or the world or the score or something that lifts star wars high above by the numbers space opera the same indefinable element that makes das rheingold more than a soap opera with occasional sorcery and the lord of the rings more than the first of five thousand episodic fantasy adventures this is the company star wars belongs in i for one am thankful that lucas never had the time or money to over fill star wars in the way that he has epiodes i and ii the new films are perfect examples of how self indulgence achieves only one thing the spoiling of the art if the film isnt quite up to the standard of the aforementioned opera or the book well maybe thats because it found its way into such company by accident it belongs there all the same 
i know die hard purists of the triology will disagree with me but i truly enjoyed these movies im a purist at heart and didnt like the fact that the movie was changed but lets be real the story line is the very same and unless youve watched the originals literally dozens of times to the point that you can recite the movie by heart youre not going to notice a majority of the differences one change that i personally didnt like was at the end of the return of the jedi when luke skywalker sees the glowing obie wan kenobi yoda and his father for some unknown reason they changed the actor who played lukes father in this scene despite the fact that its just plain rude to the original actor it didnt change the story line at all if youre a fan of the triology this dvd collection is well worth it for the updating that was done on the sound and picture as well as the fact that a dvd will last longer than a video i dont regret buying it one bit 
i dont mind the new star wars trilogy ill even watch it again minus the clones but the original trilogy is the one i keep on watching i dont know about the changing of the effects except the explosion of the death star and i really dont care i like it when some things are cleaned up because with all these new effects in movies today your eye is just drawn to the old effects but to tell you the truth i cant tell most of the time when theyve changed something i admire special effects and there can be so much added to a story with its great use but it is not essential i love the star wars trilogy because of the story the effects considering the time and most of all the actors and their lines no one beats harrison ford in the role of a sarcastic mercenary like most trilogies the three arent equally good but they stay equally entertaining throughout in the case of the bonus material i watched just about everything on there and enjoyed it all some bonus stuff released today gets very boring but this material talked about the effects the crowds and fans and the actors it was odd seeing the actors older but it was enjoyable i saw sides in lukes actor he hadnt shown in the movie which really makes me wish hed been in more movies fun bonus material very much worth it star wars is such a classic series everyone knows the name but im always surprise when i find people who havent seen the original series im not saying watch it because its a classic but it holds its place in the best movies ever youll have to see it to know what i mean 
i just bought this new release of the original star wars trilogy and i was very much impressed the picture and sound quality is excellent for vhs and though some are not needed the additional segments were interesting to watch im guessing that most of you already know the story and if you do great but bear with my brief synopsis of the videos for those underprivileged souls who have not seen them iv a new hope often referred to as the first movie it is actually the first of the trilogy not the series it quickly opens with the capture of princess leia organa senator of alderaan and the escape of see threepio and artoo detoo the two comical droids play then switches to the intro of darth vadar and the skeletal governor tarkin and then to tatooine home of ben kenobi and luke skywalker they go on a mission to bring the plans of the death star to alderaan assisted by han solo and chewbacca owners of the millenium falcon respectfully the first segment of the trilogy culminates with a lightsaber battle retreat to the rebel base and exciting mission to destroy the death star a five star movie v the empire strikes back my favorite of the series part two begins on the ice world of hoth at the new rebel base not long after the opening the base is discovered and attacked by imperial troops with leia chewbacca han and see threepio escaping on the millenium falcon and luke and artoo heading for training with jedi master yoda the falcon takes shelter in an asteroid field to begin repairs where the blossoming relationship between han and leia becomes evident luke starts to harness the force to aid him on degobah in need of help han goes to his friend lando for supplies and shelter only to find a rather unpleasant surprise waiting for them there the best movie of the trilogy five star material vi return of the jedi beginning where esb left off our heros are on a mission to rescue han solo from jabba the hutts palace after the reunion luke heads off to degobah to keep a promise to his jedi trainer yoda while the rest ship back to the rebel base to get the low down on the second death stars construction han leads a strike team after luke returns from yoda some rather interesting news from him by the way folks to the forest moon of endor to disable the shield protecting the death star this movie is practically all action ending with the battle of the ewoks vadar and lukes showdown and some interesting revelations the creepy emperor palpatine makes his appearance my least favorite of the trilogy but still a good story four stars there you have it i urge you to purchase these videos it is well worth your pocket change a new hope also includes a twelve minute trailer on episodes i and ii and how lucas plans to tie up all the loose ends extremely watchable without a killing number of spoilers if you want more info on any of these three movies individually see my reviews for each on this website final word a definite worthwhile expenditure of your money a must have for any star wars fan or movie lover 
yes fellow star wars fans it is true they made some changes to the movies from the original releases however its very worth owning the changes that lucas made did not change the most important thing about the movies the story the special effects are phenomenal but the story is golden this epic tale of the eternal struggle between good and evil is simply poetic as placed against a back drop of light sabers and alien worlds the color and sound on every film is flawless and the changes were seamless and did not interrupt the enjoyment of the film in any way the commentaries are fantastic and insightful the fourth disc is packed with great extras even the art work in each dvd is great i do ask this to all of you who are angry with the changes if you had the power to go back and change something in your life and make it better wouldnt you 
i just saw the documentary empire of dreams include with this set on tv last night it blew my mind it was filled with literally hours of behind the scenes films that i guess have never been seen before kurt russel trying out for the role of han solo weird stuff man thats all i can say about that just amazing to see just how choatic things were on set when the cameras werent rolling and telling just how closely the secret relationship between luke and vader was kept during filming apparently only lucas hamill the director of empire and james earl jones knew during filming a truly fasinating view of a world i thought i knew inside and out i wasnt sure if i should get this but seeing that documentary has awoken something inside me i must get these movies now 
this is a box set of the three good movies before the prequels came along and ruined the franchise many new scenes and updated cgi 
 reviews tell it all not since the release of the beatles let it be naked cd have i seen such anguish mixed emotion and gnashing of teeth over a re released product and mostly from those whove yet to see them what is the problem this isnt a life or death situation theyre only movies as many others have stated i have my copy already they sound look magnificent the changes make sense when tied into the overall scope of the whole star wars saga so its young anakin at the end overlaid so what if greedo shot first who really gives a rats it doesnt change the overall feel or flow of the movies themselves besides they were george lucas brainchild after all he can pretty much do what he wishes with them i can see the sense in those changes too given the release of episodes i ii and the impending release of episode iii next year the conspiracy theorists are out in force again but theyre kidding themselves if they think these movies are ruined forever sheesh with hindsight there is some hokeyness present in some parts of iv vi things like the cutesy ewoks and certain scenes in the episode iv the hug fest in the garbage compactor the droids getting emotional that hokeyness is also present in episode i the jar jar binks scenes the kiddie scenes ii the anakin padme romance but at least its consistent however thats part of the overall charm of the movies initially based on the structure of s s action movie serials like flash gordon we have the young initially naive hero luke the feisty heroine leia the swashbuckling rascal han solo loyal offsider chewbacca cute funny characters the droids and the wizard like ex warrior obi wan not to mention the supreme villian darth vader supported along the way with a host of other wierd and wonderful supporting characaters these movies are just pure sheer escapism and lots of fun i was when i first saw star wars on the big screen the opening shots of the imperial star cruiser filling the huge screen left a huge impression on me and my poor neck i was watching it four rows from the front the films set a huge standard in science fiction film making that has just gone ahead in leaps and bounds since overall im glad its on dvd finally i can now preserve my remastered vhs versions this is a dvd set to enjoy forget the changes in the film youll barely notice them just sit back forget the rest of the world for about hours and enjoy them and dont forget torank up that amazing sound 
if you are a star wars fan then this is a no brainer except with deciding which set to buy so i hope that this might clarify issues that you might have a friend of mine keeps on harping about the big difference between widescreen and fullscreen my own ignorance had me assuming that big black bars on the top and bottom were annoying also i had to squint to see the details since everything was squished from the top and bottom well thats obviously wrong and you should check out some frames of widescreen vs fullscreen on the internet now with movies without the jaw dropping views and scenes there is not much that you are gaining with widescreen but take the capture of princess leias ship in new hope or the millenium falcon chase in empire strikes back on fullscreen the image that you are left with is basically a chopped off version of the original film to fit on your computer or tv screen if you keep the same film reel format in widescreen then you will get the black bars on the top and bottom with the entire frame intacted so if you feel that you can do without black bars then go ahead and get the fullscreen otherwise get the widescreen to enjoy the trilogy which is the way it was in the movie theaters the bonus disc could be a toss up depending on how you view chipping in another ten bucks in my opinion you might as well go ahead and spring for the extra disc the price of the trilogy is already over dollars and you cant just buy the extra disk separately later plus you get alot more features in learning about how the film was made and some of ideas thoughts from writers and visual sound effects specialists at lucas films the simple disc set without bonus disc was released just recently to attract buyers who didnt want to purchase such an expensive set well its your decision but make a choice that you can look back without regret my favorite parts of the disc was the whole idea about how to create the character of darth vadar and his whole heavy breathing that we all remember quite vividly also who cant remember all those wonderful sounding lightsabers that whoosh when luke or obi wan were swinging them well those people who created the effects and sounds talk about it kinda interesting and youll never see it on tv the quality of all the films are first rate but my only gripe about the trilogy is the special edition treatment we get these silly additions of a digitally created jabba the hut and also scenes of hayden as young darth vadar taking a classic film and then getting a do over is just ridiculous its like having a writer say mark twain looking over huck finn and then going back to change bits and pieces on the plot of huck and jim its done and finished so dont mess with it art should be a finished form after its done no need to keep on polishing it over you just ruin it for the future generation and people just get confused so if you just ignore all those additional scenes from george lucas which goes for those who actually lived through the original s trilogy then go ahead and purchase this i doubt that this trilogy will ever be released in its original form without all those digitally enhanced scenes 
i can remember when i saw this movie in the theater for the first time when i was thirteen it was as if someone out there knew for the first time that sf could be intellegently for the big screen the documentary dvd sheds a lot of light on how the movies were made surprisingly all the execs thought this would be a dismal failure george lucas was not the great director everyone thought he was while making the film he almost suffered a heart attack due to the pressue i was surprised to discover that he tried to purchase the rights to star trek and flash gordon before going out on his own to write his own saga i wonder what he would have done with star trek its amazing to know that hollywood placed a fine on him for not having the credits roll until the end of the film no wonder he opened his own studio despite all his box office success he was still treated poorly by the people that helped him put up the capital for this film 
the original star wars trilogy is among the most watched and beloved film series in movie history the films have moved past being mere movies into cultural icons what other movies could spark such a heated debate over enhancements and updates as these films have done internet sites have been set up specifically to discuss the changes some of the changes work in the film the new jabba is much more realistic looking while some are completely ridiculous especially the insertion of hayden christensen in return of the jedi one wish would have been for george lucas to do what his good friend steven spielberg did with e t release two versions of each film one in its original release and the other in the updated release that being said the films look outstanding in their dvd presentation the films are one of the last handful of classic films to see their release on dvd and they are welcome in any version the bonus disk is outstanding and the two and half documentary empire of dreams is superb unto itself the changes to the films are merely superficial the true heart of the stories remain intact it is the struggle of the rebel forces to overcome the evil empire that keeps you interested and that remains undiluted 
i bought this trilogy for one reason only to replace the vhs boxed set i have of these seminal movies of my childhood i am not looking for new special effects i dont care if they have been altered i dont need hd or bluray quality and i am not looking for anything new what i am looking for is the pleasant and exciting return to the days of my youth when star wars was magic in this way this set delivers from the opening screen to the last credits i am treated to a time warp a time when computer graphics were in their infancy when plot story and character were more important that flash and gee whiz graphics i am remember standing in line the anticipation and the excitement these movies take me back there they will do the same for you too if youll let them enjoy them for what they are touchstones to a time more innocent and less jaded dont bother quibbling over what has changed or how they could be improved if youre really a purists dust off the old vhs tapes and put those up on your flat screen and maybe you too will remember why you bought these great movies great memories buy them while you still can 
when i got this i was really excited and i had a reason to be these movies rule it had been so long since i had seen the originals as i watched them again i wondered why i hadnt watched them more the first one is still just as good as ever mark hamill did an awesome job as luke and harrison ford was perfect for han solo but the best in this one is by far alec guinness as obi wan kenobi i really enjoyed this one but the empire strikes back is the best i believe i think i speak for everyone that yoda was the best actor and deserved an oscar not to mention the best one liner ever is delivered i am your father this is one series any film fan should own and for fans to marvel at as for return of the jedi death to ewoks 
i have to say i totally understand this debate over the altering of new versions of the star wars trilogy episodes and i am truly looking forward to these films in their new versions but i sympathize with those who want their films untouched as they first viewed them perhaps in my mind these may be some of the very few films ever made which could stand the updating and restoration i say that for a few reasons first of all the star wars films in question depended so greatly on the prequels that have been made in the years since also they depend on their look and seen compared to episodes and and probably the upcoming episode they may not look so great to future star wars fans who will instead see them in order which most of us did not to my thinking if it these were not revamped they would look weaker and more primitive to future generations caught up with the clarity and tone of the first films i totally agree that to change details of the story might not be wise and i am not aware to what degree this will be done except for rumour we all need to actually see them to make a judgement call for how each of us feels about the changes but if its simply a matter of cleaning up the special effects like removing the gray boxes from the spacecraft against the black skies and making yoda look more like a living being and not a muppet i am all for it artists altering their works is it okay for an artist to change his works some say no yet in history classical composers such as bach bruckner debussy and many more often had versions or new editions to change orchestration orders of movements and even which instrument would take the lead in a concerto every art scholar knows that paintings are often painted and repainted by their original creators and sometimes overpainted by other painters many years later the museums are filled with works that have had faces painted out figures added coats of arms changed or painted out and fig leaves added to male nudes there are even paintings that are painted over other paintings that were already completed this is more common in art history that you think many italian and dutch paintings have gone through extensive realtering sometimes even an artist would sign his name to another mans painting some works by rembrandt were actually painted by others in his studio he knew the painting would sell better with his name on it these days many a brand new harley davidson with state of the art design is bought by an owner only to be remodelled into a custom chopper to the raves of the magazines and buyers and that logic applies to cars great buildings and other things the real question is should motion picture films be altered my general answer is probably no i believe in cleaning them fixing badly done special effects reprinting from the original negative etc if it does not ruin the integrity and look of the original just as art museums routinely restore great paintings without a fuss from anyone but on the question of adding scenes and altering storylines that is a trickier question star wars could be the exception for the above reasons and since it is their creator who is doing it it is well known over the years he has expended on his original ideas on these sagas and he wants to right that this vision may conflict with our individual ideas of what these films may mean to us but since when do individuals agree on what is right or lacking in any given film i know many a star wars fan who hated the introduction of jar jar binks or did not care for other aspects of one of the films upon release so what is right for star wars remains the discretion of mr lucas the creator of these worlds we have been allowed to visit and in he set to film a world he wanted to share with us and now years later he wants to evolve that world for generations to be born long after we are gone while he still can i think we need to see what the man will give us in this new set and then judge if it is for us or not for what its worth i do believe the original theatrical release should be available to those who want them and the films are so popular i think both the new versions and the original versions in release will be profitable for th century fox to have on the market 
yes i have the vhs special edition and some of the changes in this dvd set are not to my liking i did not like the substitution of the hologram in the final portion of the film where anakin yoda and obi wan appear but this dvd set of pristine clarity and great sound deserves to be in every sci fis collection watch the films and then the documentary on the bonus dvd and appreciate the tremendous impact these films had on film making i saw the original movies in the theater when they came out the special edition films in the theater when they came out and now i have a superb dvd set of the three movies allow george lucas to refine his vision of the films as technology allows the budget for these films when they were made was extremely small compared to even the cost of mediocre movies today these movies were groundbreaking movies and this dvd set is a fine way to celebrate those films in these movies things were being asked in the way of special effects that had never been tried before and was truly pioneering for those who will wail over every single change well get over it it is not your film 
i remember these movies as much as i remember indiana jones and i feel that these two will always be the greatest works from george lucas that i grew up with i know it sounds hypocritical of me after my review of indiana jones but i feel that the new cgi effects lucas added to these three movies was not all that bad i say my main reason is that these were science fiction films and to that affect you wanted to see great star fighter battles and incredible technological effects and to that the new cgi effects did a spectacular job true to some real hard core fans that maybe a form of taboo to change some of the film but as a few other reviewers are saying as well the movies are owned by lucas and it is his right to change it how he sees fit i also agree with some reviewersthat the new trilogy that came after are not as great but most of thetime people can never make a copy or a remake of something that was as good as the first i say now if you havent got this box set yet the price is good at this time so buy it today
hello this is a part review of the dvd set for star wars the set itself i found the sound and picture to be of the highest quality and i own a box set of laserdiscs of these movies it was also nice to have commentaries by george lucas for the movies something that many directors still dont do the bonus dvd contains hours of extras and is really interesting the uproar regarding the changes yes i was suprised to see some of the changes since the movies aired and even since my laserdiscs were made but unlike some of the misguided people who have reviewed this set i dont think these movies belong to the people who watched them they belong to the creator and producer mr lucas if he feels that technology can be utilized to update upgrade them to his original vision or to make the series of stories more complete its his call honestly after a decade or more of upgrades on cds by remastering youd think people would be used to the fact that it can and will be done this isnt on a par with colorizing black and white movies and the same reviewers who accuse mr lucas of defacing these films are arrogant enough to say that they the viewing public are the rightful owners of them that is pure nonsense i appreciate someone writing that changes to a movie they love ruins the experience for them and can respect that to slander the person who created these movies and make personal attacks isnt very classy and would encourage anyone to disregard reviews by people making personal attacks part of their review as they obviously are unstable and have an attachment to these films that is not healthy theyre just movies and entertainment for goodness sakes these characters are not real and the inclusion of an extra scene that changes their motivation blah blah blah is psycho bottom line a very entertaining set well produced and with hours of fun extras thanks 
i was years old when the original star wars now star wars episode iv a new hope was first released in theaters i thought it was the greatest movie i had ever seen i also enjoyed episode v the empire strikes back my overall favorite of the entire saga and episode vi return of the jedi these movies remain just as fascinating for me today as they did years ago yes i love the original releases and if when george lucas releases the originals on dvd i will buy those as well but i do understand lucas reasoning behind his tweaking with the films and i do believe they help with keeping the consistency between all of the films from episode i all the way through to episode vi the bonus features disc contains a lot of great extras most notably the empire of dreams documentary which provides the most in depth look ive ever seen behind the making of the star wars saga i also enjoyed the featurettes the characters of star wars the birth of the lightsaber and the force is with them the legacy of star wars also included is the return of darth vader a behind the scenes look at episode iii revenge of the sith with all of the changes and additions and all of the griping and moaning that have followed as a result these are still three of my favorite movies of all time and i am glad they are finally available on dvd 
after years of waiting star wars the epic space opera george lucas first unleashed to the world in makes its debut on dvd lucas is of course known to be a techno freak obsessed with the concept of digital visual effects or just visual effects in general anyone hoping for the original star wars prints will be disappointed but at the end of the day it is lucass film and if youre open minded you can at least appreciate that the re touching makes the original trilogy connect better with the current prequels on dvd the trilogy looks stunning now we can truly appreciate the scope and colors of one of the great unique visions of modern movies the genius of lucas aside from the technical credits was the way he mingled ancient mythmaking with futuristic science fiction to create what is essentially a modern fairy tale star wars is like homers the odyssey an epic adventure full of romance colorful worlds characters and dashing heroism the first film a new hope introduces us to the timeless characters of luke skywalker darth vader obi wan kenobi princess leia han solo chewbacca c po and r d with operatic flare and a stunning sense of visual artistry it is amazing to watch this film and then hear lucas speak about low budget problems the score by john williams sets the tone for what became one of his most famous works he hits us with splashing colors of sound and elegant romantic strings the empire strikes back continues the saga with an even wider angle a love story develops and we are taken to worlds as diverse as the inside of an asteroid field and a planet composed of clouds this is also the first showdown between luke and vader and a shocking secret is revealed is there anyone out there who doesnt know it return of the jedi finishes things with more imaginative flare and a memorable exciting showdown between good and evil lucas deserves credit for delivering his masterpiece in a worthy dvd set we get the films with commentary and a special fourth disc that not only contains a fascinating documentary tv spots trailers and featurettes but also a small glance into what well be seeing in s episode and yes there are few re touches the scene where vader speaks with the emperor in empire has been re done a bit hayden christensen of the prequels also makes a surprise appearance in jedi so in fact the re touching isnt as devastating as some try to make it out to be star wars remains so popular because like greek mythology it appeals to our basic human feelings and ideas it is simple and romantic yet deep and meaningful consider that people who cant stand star trek are easily entertained by star wars and even if you dont care much for myths and philosophy this is good movie fun these films contain precisely what great storytelling is all about sure you can argue that the acting isnt first rate or that some of the plot threads are hokey but you cant deny that star wars has a heart this is a must have in any film collection 
two hours in a darkened movie theater in little rock arkansas in were enough to change the life of a then eight year old kid forever for anyone out there who enjoys adventure science fiction special effects or just good storytelling there is no denying that the original star wars trilogy is a monumental achievement in modern american cinema the cultural influence of these movies cannot be overstated enough the first film and its two sequels have grabbed a place in american culture right up there next to gone with the wind of movies out in the last few decades will eventually fade and be forgotten but these films will be around forever i myself now have two young kids and you can bet that i will sit down and watch these movies with them many times these three films together with their three quot prequels quot tell a basic simple story its the story of the corruption of good from within the seeming hopeless descent into evil and the eventual redemption and victory of good once you get past all the special effects and sci fi elements its actually a very powerful theme an one i think everyone can benefit from the message is wrapped up in a lot of good storytelling including awesome space battles unforgettable characters and more than a little comedy as far as the new effects and added scenes for the special edition versions i thought they were kind of a mixed bag in the first film for example i really liked the shots of the millenium falcon on approach to yavin and i also liked the shots of the x wings and y wings as they round the curve of the red gas giant on their way to do battle for the death star there were several excellent new shots on tatooine especially obi wan kenobis house and the quot new quot version of mos eisley on the other hand i could have done without some of the changes to the dogfighting scenes and also i think the movie was better off without the scene between han and jabba i also never quite understood why they added in one scene with biggs at the rebel base but not the scenes between luke and biggs on tatooine as it stands the addition of biggs is jarring and doesnt seem to make any sense it makes sense if youve read the original book but one shouldnt have to read the book to understand the movie i also thought the change to the scene with han and greedo was a mistake as for empire and jedi those changes didnt make much difference to me i own both the original and quot special quot editions of the trilogy on vhs so i get to pick and choose which ones i like the most i know that lucas is going to release these movies on dvd at some point perhaps it will be set up in a way that will allow fans to quot choose quot which version of each scene they want to see now that would be something if you are one of the few out there who havent seen or are familiar with these films im not going to spoil the plot for you i will just say this you owe it to yourself to see these movies they are classics now and forever 
it would be amazing if the released the original on dvd without any changes i dont want guns to be flash lights han to shoot second and obvious cgis that dont go with the puppets and models that make up the movie there is nothing more distracting then a beatifuly done scene with a giant video game looking character walking through all you atention is drawn away from the characters to look at some crazy creature that was inserted years after the fact and how about the scene where jabba walks around han possibly one of the worst additons ever i agree it is cool to see what they added but it is all out of place and though it was minor han shooting the alien after being shot at in the bar took away from his loosome character he is supposed to be scum who learns to help others i would be all for dvds where you can select what version you want on the front menu something like original verson and butchered version but if we cant have a choice then just give us the original 
while the lord of the rings trilogy is great the original star wars trilogy is in my opinion the greatest trilogy that has ever been made george lucas brilliance first came to the big screen in with star wars a new hope this movie would set the standard for all sci fi movies that followed with luke skywalker han solo and darth vader just to name a few a new hope was universally loved the story continued with the empire strikes back which in my opinion was the best star wars movie ever made the second movie in the original trilogy puts luke face to face with darth vader and includes the biggest revelation in movie history and one of the most famous lines ever return of the jedi concludes the original trilogy with a blast as luke and darth vader face off for the last time as the emporer watches and waits to try to turn luke to the dark side as he did with darth vader this movie trilogy is one to own 
i have heard there are changes that have been made to make these movies match with the prequels visually and story wise lets hope so star wars episode iv a new hope the imperial march has been added to darth vaders firstappearance on princess leias ship the lightsaber effects have been redone and the frame jumps of lightsabers being turned on has been removed theres a new scene which has been shot during the filming of episode iii in which the emperor dissolves the senate the bleeding arm on the floor in the cantina has been replaced with a non bleeding arm because its now canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds the original shooting scene between han and greedo has been restored when the death star destroys alderaan theres a new scene of yodas reaction to the disturbence in the force that is created by all those deaths and then it cuts to obi wan reacting to it aswell temuera morrisons voice is being recorded foruse with all the stormtroopers and boba fett in all the movies the obi wan vader duel has been remade a modified version of duel of the fates is being considered for the scene the death star battle is more epic theres a new scene with vader goes to coruscant in the same building at the end of attack of the clones and inform the emperor of a new potential who is strong in the force chewbacca now gets a medal star wars episode v the empire strikes back the battle of hoth is enhanced with a ground battle between the rebel soldiers and stormtroopers ian mcdiarmid has refilmed scenes as the emperor the conversations between vader and palpatine is now longer and features a few connections to the prequels yodas face is now animated in cg allowing more expression of emotions star wars episode vi return of the jedi jabba the hutt is now a combination of the puppet andcgi the rancor is cgi yoda is cgi yoda disappears leaving his clothes behind like obi wan now the love theme across the stars is inserted when luke is talking with leia about their mother in the battle of endor there are thousands of ewoks and they are more vicious lightsaber effects shadows on the floor are gone during anakins death scene it starts with a sad rendition of the imperial march and slowly evolves into anakins theme sebastian shaw who played anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with haydenchristensen anakins spirit is now played by hayden christensen 
the star wars trilogy is still one of the best trilogies ever made three of the best movies ever produced wonderful and took the world by storm in the late seventies a cultural icon that propelled george lucas into stardom the magic is still here years later i dont care if you dont like them or not you owe it to yourself to watch these movies i did and i loved them each movie features a commentary track with a number of people the bonus disc features a few documentaries and featurettes i suggest that all fans should view highly recommended 
lucas will probably release these on to blu ray dvds when something better than blu ray comes out and then you can buy the new format again and again and again and again and again and so on and so on do you think video quality improvement is going to end with blu ray ill bet they are working on something better than blu ray as we speak so that maybe years from now when everyones replaced their favorite dvds with blu ray discs theyll expect us to start replacing our favorite blu ray movies with yet again another improved format see where im going with this you are probably going to buy star wars over and over again til the day you die ill stick with the dvds that i have they all look fine and there is no reason to buy them again that goes for star wars as well as my other or so movies that i can barely find time to watch as it is getting the best picture of your favorite movies over and over again year after year is compulsively expensive and is hardly realistically not very necessary get a life people get off the couch 
this is the set im sure most all star wars fans are looking for if they dont already have it contains both the original theatrical releases as well as the newer special edition releases these three movies came in a tin box and was released sometime in or of course its only in standard dvd format as great an option this is exactly what i wanted dont spend bucks on it as much i love star wars lucas is a visionary and his movies are legendary lucas is greedy son of a b when i bought this set back during its release it must have been close bucks im sure lucas knows that the vast majority of star wars fans would prefer the original theatrical release for obvious reasons and thus probably likes to watch those same fans fight for these versions though my advice is to check up on ebay and other auction sites ideally it would have been nice if the blu ray discs had at least the original theatrical version in standard dvd format but i guess lucas enjoys playing the waiting game making more money off us 
ranked no on the american film institutes oo greatest films this is one of the best movie ever made though i like the empire strikes back better this is my second favorite star wars film though it has extremely heavy competition from return of the jedi the cast is wonderful including mark hamill harrison ford carrie fisher and alec guinnes whom was nominated for best supporting actor the action is excellent such as a laser fight through the death star and a spectacular space fight where rebel x and y wings battle inperial tie fighters and turbolasers from the death star while trying to destroy the death star r d and c po are great as is chewbacca david prowse plays darth vader and james earl jones performs his voice resulting as a great character i suggest you rent or buy this film 
when star wars opened in theaters were packed with audiences waiting in lines to see the space opera that george lucas had masterfully crafted the movie which became one of the top grossing films of all time changed forever the way science fiction movies were made elevating the genre from the realm of b movies to serious fiction so much so that the original star wars movie subtitled a new hope was nominated for the best picture oscar that year the technology of the time was somewhat limited and though it was considered cutting edge in its day special effects limited the vision which george lucas had hoped to present to his worldwide audience it seemed only fitting therefore that on the anniversary of his opus he would return to the world of star wars once more re inventing the movie that launched a franchising monstrosity in a galazy not so far from home what was created was the extended edition of the star wars movies with a special focus on the first installment a new hope industrial light and magic lucasfilms effects house which was in its infancy at the time star wars was produced was brought back on the project once more to expand the film into the vision lucas had originally envisioned while all three films were to be touched up for the year anniversary release it was a new hope that was given the biggest facelift scenes that had been cut were re introduced to the film new scenes with the aid of some cutting edge cgi were created and the film as a whole was retouched enhancing the color and sound through the use of digital processing the movie opened with much of the same hype as it had years earlier storylines which had been developed in the empire strikes back and the return of the jedi were fleshed out some in this first film and for the first time we saw the famous scene where han has his initial run in with jabba the hutt a scene that was omitted in the original release due to a lack of effects technology to create the slug like jabba additional sequences included a greatly enhanced mos eisley spaceport full of droids strange alien lifeforms and a barrage of businesses and settlements that gave the city a much greater scope than the original similar additions were created for the sequels though most of the revision work there surrounding the enhancement of exisitng scenes as with new hope the films were cleaned up providing new digital effects where blue screen and miniatures had been used previously the changes more subtle than the first are still impressive especially the altered ending to the return of the jedi though this reviewer will not ruin the ending for the viewer lets simply state that there will no longer be a need to suffer through the ewoks song that seemed sadly anti climatic at the end of the original release of the film the special effects in these films play more like characters than situations and ilm has done a great job of cleaning them up especially impressive are the new fight flight sequences at the end of a new hope when the rebel alliance is engaged with the empire with the intent of destroying the death star the new visuals which were blended in many cases with existing effects are much more fluid providing a greater sense of reality to the viewer for anyone unfamiliar with the story surrounding the star wars franchise it begins with a farmboy named luke skywalker mark hamill whose greatest dream is to be a pilot in the imperial fleet when his uncle purchases a pair of droids for their farm he uncovers a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia organa carrie fisher for the mysterious jedi knight obi wan ben kenobi alec guiness which begins a string of events that will forever change lukes life with the aid of rogue pilot han solo harrison ford and chewbacca ben and luke along with c p anthony daniels and r d head out to alderan where they hope to aid the rebel alliance in overthrowing the empire by destroying the emperors most lethal weapon the dreaded death star a spacestation capable of destroying entire planets upon their arrival they run head long into the death star which has recently destroyed the planet of alderan leias homeworld their ship captured the crew escape capture with the aid of hans smuggling compartments built into the floor of his ship they set out into the death star to rescue the princess dis engage the tractor beam and ultimately return to the secret base of the rebel alliance kenobi whose actions differ some sets out to confront darth vader david prowse voiced by james earl jones ambassador to the emporer and former pupil of kenobi the balance of the story and the sequels are for the viewer to discover these films which have been digitally transfered to video cassette in both wide screen and full screen editions are spectacular with a clarity of sound and color that is better than any other release of the films to date the extras on the video cassette are sparse save for a three part making of serving as an introduction to each of the films narrated most by leonard maltin film critic and george lucas these introductions to offer a good glimpse into the process lucas and his sizable staff undertook in the re creation of the many sequences in each film as the original star wars trilogy is not yet available on dvd this collection is probably the closest transfer in existance of these films to a digital video the videos are clean with enhanced sound and color that really do make the movies seem as if they were brand new instead of a re release of a film that is over years old the additions to each of the film are enjoyable though some look contrived especially the sequences surrounding vaders return to his star destroyer at the end of the empire strikes back you will note that the general who meets him at the end of empire is the same as the one who greets him at the beginning of jedi it would seem that lucas spliced some spare footage from jedi into empire to expand the scene though many critics complain that the films should not have been doctored the extended edition nonetheless does offer up a fresh look for the films and for the uninitiated the closest opportunity available to experiencing the star wars franchise the way it was seen when it first packed the theaters in these films have stood the test of time and now with the release of all three in this collectors edition are a worthwhile addition to any video library scott kolecki
wow the original trilogy looks great on dvd the image is crisp the colors more vibrant the sound is great some people will hate the changes but they dont add a whole lot that wasnt in the special edition release of and i actually loved those additions except for the new musical scene in jabbas palace in rotj still makes me wince the new changes actually help the continuity and make it feel like the movies fit together better when you watch all six the only new change that bothered me at first were boba fetts voice being changed to match jangos and young anakin substituted at the very end of rotj now that i am used to them though they dont bother me at all in fact i believe that is a big reason people hate them and the new trilogy for that matter people just arent used to them once theyve been around for a while they will be more and more accepted until they are just part of star wars thats my philosophy anyways these movies are still classics 
we can say what we want about george lucas and his short comings with his star wars films we can moan and groan over the fact that the man is a perfectionist who cant just leave a film alone so he hasnt heard the expression if it aint broke dont fix it or if he has hes certainly not paying attention to it we can also get upset that he likes to play down to his audiences however we sometimes forget that this is star wars its easy to not enjoy his latest films because they did not create the stir in cinema history like his first film which literally changed the way we see movies today jaws may have been the first summer blockbuster hit but star wars blew the doors off no film like it had ever been made up until that time yes there were television shows such as star trek and space that tried to jumpstart science fiction in many ways they succeeded but there was something infinitely more magical about star wars the story is simple while the special effects especially for would transport the viewers to a time and place never conceived of before first of all these dvds look great the restoration is beautifully done the colors have never been more vivid and alive nor have the sounds they look better now than ever before star warsdespite george lucass changing the title i still think of star wars as the original to my mind it is still the best entry second only to the empire strikes back and yep george directed this one which embodies his best work perhaps it is because he didnt have the technology to bury the story and dialogue that we find a good story and decent dialogue even by todays standards the opening sequence still looks fantastic as the star destroyer chases down the rebel blockade runner with a monstrous on board battle to follow alec guiness is still wonderful as the ever wise sage obi wan kenobi who leads our young band of heroes on a daring rescue attempt of princess leia on board the dreaded death star i still remember the wonderful fantasy of romping around on a huge space station blasting stormtroopers lucas plays right into the dreams of every hot blooded american boy cowboys quickly seemed superfluous by comparison to having a laser gun the final battle still holds up and is still george lucass best space battle out of all the films hes done its more personal and gripping as luke skywalker attempts to destroy the death star with darth vader about to blow him to bits the is especially true as his shipmates are destroyed one by one the performances are great too harrison ford as the sarcastic han solo reminds you of his more likeable character to follow indiana jones mark hamill also turns in his best performance of the trilogy carrie fisher is great but her best performance would actually be in the next film and as always theres the loveable droids c po and r d lucass favorite character most of the additional scenes are good i still dont like han solo chasing stormtroopers around a corner to find himself facing of them theyre just standing there i find this unlikely especially when hes chased back by the same small squad that he chased to begin with i found the original version of him running into a dead end more humorous and effective empire strikes backstill the best entry in both the original trilogy and overall empire strikes back is one of the best science fiction films ever made george lucas hands over the directing to irving kushner aside from episode this is the darkest of the films with darth vader obsessed with finding luke skywalker chasing han solo and the millenium falcon all over the galaxy the shift from the hot desert of tatooine to the ice planet of hoth is an effective move especially the climactic battle in the snow that sends the rebel forces running for their lives finally we are introduced to one of the best characters not only in star wars but cinema history yoda frank oz provides a charm to yoda as luke at first does not know who he is yoda may stand only feet tall but his wisdom is colossal as luke quickly realizes when yoda forces him to confront his fears let the han vs leia begin the banter between these two characters is simply classic right from the get go these two unwilling to share their true feelings find themselves locked in a one liner combat id just as soon kiss a wookie snaps leia i can arrange that you could use a good kiss han fires back everything from the asteroid field to hans fate in the carbon freezing chamber in cloud city is perfect but nothing prepares you for the dreaded secret as luke skywalker chooses to face darth vader the sad part is that new viewers will never have this surprise because obviously luke is anakins son but as a viewer back in it was simply haunting to hear vader say no luke i am your father i still remember the hush that fell over the audience once those words were uttered empire strikes back is as close to perfect as any star wars film has come it balances adventure romance spiritual depth and humor all in one return of the jediprobably few films have ever held as much anticipation as this one did empire strikes back left us with a major cliff hanger what would happen to han solo what about lukes jedi training that he neglected who is this mysterious other that yoda refers to unfortunately return of the jedi is one of the weakest entries into the star wars saga if not the weakest first of all nearly half the film is spent on han solos rescue we find that luke has suddenly acquired his jedi powers we dont know exactly how much time has elapsed since the end of the empire strikes back but the rescue of han isnt the meat of the story the plot and the attempt to finally destroy the evil empire is where the focus really belongs and only an hour and minutes or so simply isnt long enough to do this revenge of the sith was far more effective because the entire film was based on the fall of the republic and anakin skywalker lucas also used hours and minutes to do it another weak entry is the ewoks to my mind only jar jar was worse a little too cutsy and entirely unbelieveable that little teddy bears with spears could out fight at sts and a legion of stormtroopers i understand that their objective was to provide a diversion but even this is not very credible it would have been far more effective had george been able to go with his original intentions of a planet of wookies george lucas has said that he loves to show things going on simultaneously but he isnt very good at it instead he sacrifices a lot of story by constantly jumping between luke and vader the battle on endor and the battle in space he may have been more successful had he made the film longer so that he could devote the necessary time to each to make them even more compelling another problem i had was with han solo even harrison ford had to practically be begged to come back as he was very dissatisfied with han solo han goes from a confident sarcastic character to a love lorne milksop all he can think about is leia and it becomes very old very fast even though return of the jedi is the weakest entry i still feel the original trilogy is the best more attention was paid to the characters and story there are enough extras and bonus features to keep the most avid fan busy the commentaries are fun to listen to even after all these years you still cant go wrong with star wars and star wars still set the tone for all sci fi films to follow my only hope is that george will leave well enough alone most of his additional footages are fine it will be interesting in years to find out what changes he has in mind for the new trilogy enjoy the best sci fi trilogy ever made somehow you never get tired of watching them 
in i was years old one of my earliest memories is waiting in line to see this movie just after my th birthday all summer vacation was spent playing with the action figures flying my x wing and having whiffle ball bat lightsaber duels with mark down the street does anyone remember nearly freezing his fingers off re enacting the battle of hoth out in the snow what about finding that long lost snowtrooper figure after the first spring thaw leia in the slave girl outfit cmon guys you know what im talking about star wars was life the opening scene of the first movie where you see princess leias ship come into view dazzles the eye you think to yourself look at the size of that thing then seconds later vaders cruiser proceeds to swallow up your entire field of vision making the first ship look like a life boat trying to escape the titanics death throes you knew you were in for a wild ride as for the re makes well done it gives the original fans a beautiful remake to watch and gives new fans a prettier film to see younger viewers spoiled by todays technology wont be so quick to dismiss these films and cheesy and poorly made when comparing them to the lord of the rings and god help me charlie and the chocolate factory i shudder to think of anyone comparing harrison fords brash han solo to depps creepy willy wonka to me the original trilogy is just more fun to watch the acting is a little better the characters are more likable they get rid of the silly ewok song at the end of jedi no jake lloyd all solid reasons to pick up this boxed set and on your way home swing by the toy store and pick up a brand new whiffle ball bat youll thank yourself later 
what can i say about a set of movies which almost everyone on the planet has seen at least once in their lives not much right these are the special editions and i didnt have too much of a problem with them most of the extra footage rounded the movies out and gave the viewer a better idea of what lucas was trying to do the best example of this in my mind is the scene in episode iv a new hope when luke and company enter mos eisley you get a better view of the city and its population another plus was the scene at the end when the rebel fighters are rounding yavin on their approach of the death star you get to see the pilots heads moving and they dont have such a one dimensional feel to them episode v had the least amount of changes and remains my favorite i particularly enjoyed the expanded scene with the snow monster in the original the limitations were painfully obvious as we saw very little of the monster now you can see him eating moving etc i feel it adds a certain amount of tension a scene which was lacking however i didnt think all of the additions were good i didnt like the added footage of darth vader nor was i impressed with jabba i could have done without the comic performance at jabbas palace in jedi but i did enjoy the new ending all in all these films are classics and should be part of any movie fans collection 
i was one of the one star reviews based on missleading information i was wrong i purchased these movies any way and they are awesome 
its beautiful absolutely beautiful thank you mr george lucas next to my computer is a inch flat panel display im watching these three movies over and over and over i was sixteen when the first movie came out in may and i got to wait in the long lines to watch it in the theater im so happy these dvds finally came out 
before i obtained this trilogy i had been reading hundreds of reviews and discusion forums on how terrible these movies are and how changed they are i got the trilogy yesterday had a party with my family and watched all films back to back to back a new hope was just like it was years ago and it was better even greedo did not get in the way of enjoying this movie when it was over we all clapped for the credits and agreed at how great it was the seconed one was spotless and even the lightsabers were just right the new boba fett voice was just right empire strikes back has not changed the last one rotj took the cake with the battle of endor and the final lightsaber battle these three films were an epic journey that i had not enjoyed that much ever in my life these are so much better than the originals i know that the hayden replacement sucks now but after watching the episode three trailer i have no doubt that people will have a different respect for him after they see episode three the trilogy i saw last night was the same trilogy i had seen when i was little it also can now pass for the best trilogy of all times ps in case you were thinking that i must not be a true star wars fan who knows all the little details your wrong i just am telling you the truth these movies made me proud to be an original trilogy star wars fanatic

a single day has gone by in the eight years weve been running the digital bits that we werent asked when is star wars coming out on dvd weve struggled to answer that question as best we could of course constantly checking with both th century fox and lucasfilm weve repeatedly tried to convince george lucas himself to release these films on dvd eventually succeeding in getting at least the prequel films on disc after a long campaign with other websites in which we jointly collected over signatures and took out a full page ad in daily variety but as to the ultimate question of when star wars the empire strikes back and return of the jedi would be released on our favorite format lucasfilms answer was always eventually well eventually has finally arrived hard though it is to believe the star wars trilogy arrives on dvd in the form of a new disc box set containing not only the much loved movies but also a separate disc of all new bonus material so lets take a closer look shall we well start with the films themselves as most of you know star wars episode iv a new hope tells the story of luke skywalker a young farmboy living on a backwater planet with dreams escaping his humdrum plight for a life of heroism in outer space it seems that the galaxy is embroiled in a massive civil war between the evil galactic empire and the freedom loving rebel alliance luke longs to fight for what he believes in but the conflict is raging a long way from his far flung world at least until a pair of bumbling droids suddenly arrives on his uncles farm luke discovers that the droids are carrying a secret message from a rebel princess intended for a wizened jedi knight named obi wan kenobi who happens to live nearby the droids are also carrying the stolen plans for the empires ultimate weapon the death star a massive space station with enough firepower to destroy an entire planet unless these plans can be safely delivered to the rebel forces their struggle for freedom and justice will be crushed once and for all so with the help of kenobi and a wise cracking pirate named han solo luke suddenly finds himself whisked away into deep space on the adventure of his life pursued all the while by the empires most sinister agent of evil darth vader its really unnecessary to say much more about this film as youre all no doubt intimately familiar with it by now released as a lark in by th century fox george lucas original star wars became a hugely successful blockbuster almost overnight and it quickly changed the landscape of hollywood filmmaking not only reviving a long lost cinematic genre but also pioneering the field of movie visual effects the film had an incalculable impact on my then ten year old life opening my eyes to the possibilities of the film medium and firing my imagination like nothing before it im certain that like me most of you have a very special place for the film in your hearts but star wars today is somewhat different than you might remember it from or even the special edition re release as you may have heard a number of new digital changes have been made to the star wars films for this dvd release as with the special edition a new hope has received the majority of the attention many shots have been altered in very subtle ways which only the most zealous fans will notice there are however a number of more major changes in a new hope these include a revised opening shot as lukes landspeeder enters mos eisley spaceport the speeder model is more detailed and moves more naturally an improved version of the han greedo fight greedo still shoots first but only just the blasts are much closer together and hans movement is smoother a new cg model of jabba the hutt its a revised version of the episode i model of the character and is much improved and re rotoscoped lightsaber blades throughout the film blade color is more pronounced and the animation is more like the prequel films personally i quite like most of these changes the han greedo fight is still less than perfect but it does look more natural hans head doesnt jerk like it did before instead his whole upper body shifts over slightly and the blaster shots are very close together now so the encounter is not as implausible as it was in i still wish george would just let han shoot first as he did originally in but i can at least stomach watching this scene now three years after the release of the original film episode v the empire strikes back continued the epic adventure after successfully destroying the death star luke and his rebel friends have been pursued across the galaxy by darth vader and the empires mighty space fleet while hiding out in a new secret base on the frozen planet of hoth the rebels are discovered by vader after a massive snow battle our heroes barely escape with their lives and are scattered across space luke finds his way to the jungle planet dagobah where he begins training to become a jedi knight meanwhile han and the princess find refuge on the planet bespin unaware that theyve been followed by vaders forces soon luke must abandon his training to come to his friends rescue ultimately risking his fate in a reckless confrontation with vader himself widely considered to be the best of the star wars series the empire strikes back tells a much darker and more personal story than the original film despite the inclusion of several dramatic action sequences in a risky move this unconventional sequel sees the good guys basically getting their asses kicked from the start of the film until the very end its not a happy or upbeat adventure by any means and it ends with a stunning and unforeseen twist that left theater audiences hanging on the edge of their seats for more than three years after its original release in despite the cliff hanger ending or perhaps because of it empire ranks easily among the best film sequels of all time it holds up well to this day the digital changes to empire for this dvd release are fewer than they are in a new hope in fact there are only three major changes these include the use of temuera morrison as the voice of boba fett which i suppose makes sense given that boba is a clone of jango from episode ii the elimination of lukes scream when he jumps to escape vader on cloud city which had been a source of much debate among fans why would he scream if he were jumping willingly and the use of actor ian mcdiarmid as the emperor replacing the old woman and voice actor clive revill who played the character originally i should note that the emperor alteration also involves a change in the scenes dialogue one that is at first confusing the emperor now tells vader that he has no doubt the young rebel who destroyed the death star is the offspring of anakin skywalker to which vader replies how is that possible that doesnt seem to make sense because we know that vader is aware of who luke is from dialogue earlier in the film thats it the rebels are there and im sure skywalker is with them i suspect however that well find out in episode iii that anakin does learn of lukes existence as an infant and he hides this knowledge from the emperor what that would mean is that vaders been waiting all these years to find luke as an adult and turn him to the dark side so that they can overthrow the emperor together a plot vader ultimately confesses to luke at the end of empire well have to wait for episode iii to see how this new bit of dialogue fits in concluding the original trilogy in episode vi return of the jedi opens as luke now a fully trained jedi knight returns with his friends to his home planet to rescue han solo from the vile crime lord jabba the hutt luke then revisits dagobah and learns that he must ultimately confront darth vader if the galaxy is to have any hope of peace luke also learns a surprising secret before rejoining the rebels as they prepare for the final decisive battle in the conflict between rebellion and empire an all out assault on the emperors second and even more powerful death star as the final chapter of the star wars saga return of the jedi fails to be either as fresh as the original film or as surprising as empire too much is predictable here such as the appearance of a second death star and too many compromises were made for the younger audience members the very presence of the ewoks for example which is especially noticeable after the more adult themes of the previous installment that said jedi does manage to adequately complete the story arc of the original trilogy theres nice symmetry with the way the character storylines are wrapped up and theres enough action to keep the film interesting ill be curious to see how well this conclusion works in the context of the overall film saga once episode iii arrives in theaters in may as with empire are three major digital changes to jedi all of which appear at the end of the film when luke removes vaders mask to reveal his fathers face the eyebrows of actor sebastian shaw have been erased presumably because anakins face will be badly burned in episode iii then after the second death star is destroyed when the film cuts to the various celebrations around the galaxy naboo is now included among the planets we see finally and this is a big one when the force ghosts of ben yoda and anakin appear to luke at the very end of the film actor sebastian shaw has been replaced with hayden christensen as hell appear in episode iii thats going to piss off a lot of fans but it makes sense i suspect the rational is that a jedis force ghost is frozen in appearance at the exact moment of his or her death since anakin skywalker basically ceases to exist in episode iii becoming darth vader his ghost remained at that age yeah its a stretch but hey within the logic of the universe it does make sense like it or not ultimately ive accepted that lucas is entitled to change these films until hes happy with them the fact is hes been changing them since for example right after the first film was released and became a hit lucas quickly went back in and added the episode iv a new hope tag these new cg alterations are simply the logical continuation of his desire to overcome the technical challenges he faced when he originally made the films i have to tell you im as surprised as anyone to find myself actually appreciating most of these changes with the sole exception of the han greedo scene which still bothers me although less now than as it was in i think all of the changes are either genuine improvements or simply make sense given the ties to the prequel films i still think lucas has a responsibility to save the original versions of these films out of respect for the fans who have supported them all these years the artists who creatively invested themselves in the original work and as a way to remind us all just how far the films have come since they were first released and i still have hope that well see those original versions released on disc eventually in a more elaborate box set of the entire saga but more on that later so thats the films as youll find them on these new dvds now lets talk about the dvds themselves click to the next page of the review and ill tell you all about it part two dvd presentation quality extrasthe most important part of any dvd presentation is the video and audio quality of the film itself so how do the star wars trilogy dvds stack up in this regard simply put the star wars films have never and i mean ever looked this good before the films presented on these discs absolutely sparkle in all their anamorphic widescreen glory the folks at thx and lowry digital worked for months to create new high definition digital masters of these films transferred directly from the original negatives once the films were transferred painstaking efforts were made to clean the digital masters of dust dirt scratches and excessive grain to give you an idea of just how much work was involved more than bits of debris were digitally removed from each frame ultimately entailing the removal of over million such blemishes in all over the three films combined as a result you will not find a single speck anywhere on any of these films the snow white slopes of hoth and the sand baked dunes of tatooine have never looked so pure because the transfers were done from the original negatives youre going to see detail in these films that youve never seen before youll notice this right from the opening shot of a new hope when the star destroyer chases its quarry over the surface of tatooine just look at the subtle swirl of could patterns on the planet below astonishing best of all not a lick of added edge enhancement was required to bring out this detail what else is good the color palette here is more lush and accurate than ever before youre going to be blown away by everything from subtle flesh tones to the vibrant gold plating on c pos chest to the bright orange flightsuits of the rebel pilots contrast is also spectacular with deep detailed blacks and clear accurate whites all three films in this set are just going to absolutely blow you away and the bigger your screen the better it gets the star wars trilogy on dvd is the best excuse youre ever going to have to go out and buy yourself a good anamorphic widescreen display until true high definition arrives it just doesnt get better than this on the audio side all three films have been fully re mixed in true dolby digital surround ex the dynamic range in these mixes is impressive everything from the softest passages of john williams signature score to the most explosive moments of action will full your home theater space with natural immersive sound the mixes are packed with atmospheric fill active panning and surround play the matrix ed ex center back channel is nicely active youll definitely be glad you have an extra speaker back there believe me dialogue is at all times clear and the lfe will really give your subwoofer a workout these audio mixes are an absolutely appropriate match to the near perfect image quality the sonic experience of these films on dvd will floor you as with the previous dvds for the phantom menace and attack of the clones each movie disc features there different menu sets themed to the various planets visited in the film these appear at random when you boot up the disc although there are codes you can use to see specific sets see the easter egg guide on the previous page in terms of extras each movie disc also features a full length audio commentary track with members of the cast and crew for all three films george lucas provides his thoughts on the overall themes and concepts as well as interesting anecdotes on the characters and production actress carrie fisher princess leia chimes in as well with her thoughts and shares some particularly funny behind the scenes stories about working on the films sound designer ben burtt discusses his audio work and the creation of various sounds for each character vehicle prop and environment and dennis muren addresses the elaborate special effects work for the empire commentary director irving kershner joins this group to provide his insights on the making of the film as with the the phantom menace and attack of the clones commentaries the name of the person talking will occasionally appear at the top of the screen to help you identify them i dont want to spoil anything here youve all been waiting so long for these dvds that its just better for you to experience it all yourself just know that the commentaries are fascinating and absolutely worth listening to the majority of the extras in this set are contained on its fourth disc appropriately titled bonus material this opens with an animated menu that depicts the falcon flying through the asteroid field in empire you eventually end up in the falcons cockpit to make your selections i should also note here that nearly every item on this disc is presented in anamorphic widescreen video a very nice touch arguably the most important bonus feature on the disc is kevin burns minute empire of dreams the story of the star wars trilogy documentary burns was given full access to the expansive lucasfilm archives and was able to uncover hours of behind the scenes footage from the making of these films that youve definitely never seen before the documentary begins with lucas original idea for the films then covers the development pre production filming and post production of the original star wars in tremendous depth burns idea was to take you back to to relive not only the struggle that was the making of the original film but also the film going climate into which it was ultimately released you are there are at the chinese theatre in hollywood waiting in line to see the film for the first time you actually get to see the original version of the opening crawl sans the episode iv a new hope tag and it will give you chills to see believe me you get to hear from absolutely everyone involved in the making of these films over new in depth and original interviews were conducted with all the major cast members the production staffers etc theyre all here to give you their thoughts on the films the first hour of empire of dreams is devoted exclusively to a new hope and then the remaining time is split between the making of empire and jedi as i said youre going to see things you never knew existed footage of the cast clowning around on the set a couple alternate versions of scenes from the films plenty of production artwork and still photos you name it irving kershner tells a great story about how the secret of lukes parentage was kept hidden from the cast crew and fans its pretty amazing stuff the documentary does drag a little bit once you get past the first hour but youll still enjoy every minute of it and youll probably watch it more than once if youre a fan also on this disc are a set of three production featurettes the characters of star wars tells of the development of each character within the story and how each major role was cast this includes some great never before seen video of actors who tried out for the parts but didnt get them can you imagine kurt russell as han solo cindy williams as leia william katt yeah the greatest american hero as luke its fun stuff the birth of the lightsaber addresses how the traditional weapon of the jedi came to be we get to see rare video of fight rehearsals and on set raw footage without the blades rotoscoped in ben burtt tells you how he came up with the sound etc again good stuff the force is with them the legacy of star wars looks at the influence the star wars films have had on hollywood filmmaking and filmmakers as a whole it features new interviews with the likes of peter jackson ridley scott steven spielberg james cameron and many others as they each talk about how the success of these films affected their careers and their work fans of star wars minutiae will be pleased to learn that a whole gallery of rare theatrical trailers and tv spots for each film has been included on this disc each in anamorphic widescreen video and presented in quality youve never seen before there are also galleries of original poster art for the films as well as a gallery of rare production photos the production photos are very cool to see but theyre also a little frustrating because they include images from many deleted scenes weve all been waiting to see for years thats all fine and good except none of these actual scenes are included on the disc thats right you will not get to see luke and biggs on tatooine from a new hope the wampa attack from empire or the sandstorm from jedi the fact that theyre not here is deliberate and tells you something else theyve been held back for inclusion on a more elaborate special edition release of these films in the future i actually have word from sources that lucasfilm is already planning the high definition box set of the whole film saga possibly for the original films th anniversary in it shouldnt come as any surprise that more elaborate special editions will eventually be released but i found the lack of deleted scenes here to be irritating and i think others will as well its a major strike against the extras on this set there are three other cool extras on this disc youll want to check out and others many of you wont give a rip about the cool stuff includes a long awaited sneak peek at the forthcoming episode iii this takes the form of a featurette on the return of darth vader we get to see the production staff building the new vader costume actor hayden christensen talking about what its like to don the familiar black helmet and christensen and co star ewan mcgregor practicing the infamous lightsaber duel that will climax the film i think it will get you sufficiently pumped for the last star wars film ever at least enough to hold you over until november when the teaser trailer for the film will arrive in theaters speaking of trailers as with the previous star wars dvds these discs include dvd rom weblinks to an exclusive online site where you may get the first look at additional footage from these films the episode iii trailer etc the other cool extra is a nifty easter egg hidden in the bonus discs menus like the previous dvds is the code to unlock it when you do this successfully youll be treated to a funny gag reel from the original star wars films see the easter egg guide on the previous page for instructions on how to access it i should also note that two of the aforementioned production featurettes on this dvd have funny little moments during the credits that youll enjoy as well whats left on this disc is the not so cool by which i mean the marketing fluff this includes a trailer for the star wars battlefront xbox game and a preview teasing the making of the forthcoming episode iii videogame i frankly dont care about either but i suppose some of you out there will its also worth nothing here that if you put this disc on your xbox machine youll get to play a complete preview level of star wars battlefront again i couldnt give a rip but im sure some of you will appreciate this so thats the star wars trilogy on dvd circa the films themselves definitely look and sound better than youve ever seen them before and there are enough little and not so little tweaks and changes to each one to either thrill you or make you want to pull your hair out or both the extras on this disc set are generally quite good with the exception of the marketing material and the lack of deleted scenes none of it is truly great but its certainly good and worthy of your time going through these extras you definitely get the sense that whats been included here is just the tip of the iceberg and that much more elaborate special editions of these films are likely to find their way to disc in the years ahead given the long wait to get these films on dvd well no dvd release could probably be equal to that level of anticipation still with picture and sound quality like this its pretty easy to justify the purchase price for this set throw in the documentary and the audio commentaries and its really a no brainer after all my bitching and moaning about getting these films on dvd over the years my occasional tantrums and frequent soap box proclamations am i finally a happy star wars fan you know i dont even know what the words happy star wars fan mean anymore but am i secretly giddy that i finally have these films on dvd yeah i am i hate myself a little for it but such is the curse of star wars geeks everywhere no matter how angry and jaded i get i still get chills when that logo crashes across my screen and that familiar john williams fanfare blares over my speakers yeah i got a bit of the goosebumps when i found out that episode iii was going to be called revenge of the sith and yeah ill go to whatever crap movie the episode iii teaser trailer is attached to just for a couple minutes of extreme geek out time dont even try to pretend that a lot of you dont feel the exact same way were a pretty pathetic bunch arent we anyway i hope you all enjoy these dvds god knows youve waited long enough to get them 
although i was not alive when these movies originally came out i always enjoy watching them they are fantastic science fiction movies 
nm to say but this is a must see for any sci fi fan or any movie buff for that matter ive seen the originals the special editions and also these verisons and i take em all i dont mind the reworkings to add to the story 
if you own the special edition star wars trilogy on video already and if theyre in good condition then theres really no reason to purchase this new reisssue in fact the only bonus is a behind the scenes featurette of episode ii but even that is a disappointment with the first video release of the special editions back in the videos featured the theatrical trailers and a behind the scenes feature before the actual film those bonuses are absent now to make room for the empty episode ii featurette the new packaging has a sporty new look and retitles the trilogy with their new quot episode iv v and vi quot handles and the sound and picture quality is first rate for a video release as for the films themselves they are first rate entertainment i recommend viewing each film in chronological order just for the heck of it 
fyi on september the original trilogy prints will be released on dvd with new artwork shown above the good each film will have their original print release for star wars for empire for jedi on the first disc with the bastardized dvd counterpart on disc limited edition means limited edition available only through the bad no special features none zero dolby surround the f k each from what it looks like these wont be available as a six disc set the end definitley wont be the last release of star wars on dvd may th marks thirty years of everything star wars also lands on a friday that year big screen re release instead of dvd star wars in d i must see mmm yes 
a lot of people are upset that they released another boxed set with the original star wars trilogy this i can understand but what people dont realize is that this set contains the original versions of the movies and not the versions george went back and screwed with no more out of place cgi shots disc of all three movies is the cgied versions but the bonus disc contain the original versions which are the ones to watch although a lot of people would complain that the original versions arent in anamorphic widescreen it doesnt mean much to me at all for the movies themselves star wars an amazing campy movie great characters special effects for the time and a story with nonstop action a lot of fun and nothing else starsthe empire strikes back one of the greatest movies of all time simply an outstanding movie chalked full of amazing special effects this movie combines the fun of the original with a hint of seriousness and black humor one of my favorites starsthe return of the jedi the most action packed of all the movies i thought that the sub plot with jabba the hutt went on for a little too long but the rest of the movie is up to par with the first two great fun all around starsso overall what do i really need to say about the trilogy the boxed set contains the good versions so what are you waiting for 
we owned the trilogy on dvd but its worth the upgrade to get the blu ray version we have a blu ray player that upgrades the quality of dvds and it was still worth it for us to own the blu ray the biggest difference that i noticed was with the sound the surround sound is awesome and it really is the best way to watch these classics 
this right here is only the original trilogy which is the best i like return of the jedi myself it also comes with the back in print dvd so if you dont want first well this is the star wars set to get 
it appears messing with a classic has created mixed feelings among fans even if the guy that did it made these films the star wars trilogy has been accused of being recycled garbage and the reason that movies have been dumbed down events its also been applauded for bringing fun back to movies even as it tackles some themes common to more serious films naw theyre both wrong the star wars trilogy is just plain fun lucas attempted to recapture the wonder and excitement of cliffhangers all the while dealing with some heavy duty stuff he read in joseph campbells books on mythology and heroes i dont believe i have to recap the story here lets move on to how the discs look and sound the big question outside of the quality of the dvds is has it been changed yet again yep the optical effects have been spiffed up one more time making the film look even better than before its not on the scale of the first facelift these films received when it was reissued in voices and images have been replaced and the sound remixed as part of lucas attempt to make these three films more consistent with the prequels he did star wars has become so much a part of our modern mythology that theres really nothing critical i can say and it wouldnt really matter its a pity that lucas didnt release these versions along with the original theatrical cuts that played in and first off all three films look terrific its clear a lot of care went into these transfers the image quality is smooth and although its clear these were transferred from film theres little of the omnipresent grain that hints at an optical effect secondly the depth clarity and sharpness are among the best ive seen in a dvd transfer theres minimal edge enhancement and its rarely distracting like some other recent releases comparing this edition to the previously released laserdisc and video editions of the film the dvd collection is like comparing a rich desert to a candy bar while they both taste sweet the desert belongs to a completely different class altogether the sound is for the most part outstanding the website the digital bits indicated that there were some issues with the sound lucasfilm responded that the soundtrack was remixed a bit for this edition while these moments are a bit distracting they dont impact the overall experience of the movie overall after a long long wait the star wars trilogy on dvd was well worth the wait with a minute documentary discussing the creation of the star wars universe from conception to execution empire of dreams is among the best original and most exhaustive documentaries ever on a film series the documentary has loads of behind the scenes footage shot on locations and sets for all three films im surprised at how much documentation exists for a new hope as it was the first in the trilogy and lucas had no idea if he was going to be able to make any additional films in the saga lucas discusses the script itself and how the three films in the series all have their genesis in the page script lucas wrote since he couldnt possibly get a green light for a minute movie he broke the script into its three acts borrowing the conclusion of the death star destruction from the end of the script and transposing it to the end of a new hope theres also an easter egg on the fourth disc go to the menu where you can select the games browse over to main menu but dont push enter instead hit the on your remote and enter this will take you to a spot next to main menu where you enter hit enter and youll be takent to the dvd credits where there is about two minutes of bloopers from all three films original producer gary kurtz optical effects wizards dennis muren and john dykstra along with various crew and model makers are interviewed for the film discussing the creation of ilm in van nuys california we also get three marvelous featurettes a sneak peak at the new revenge of the sith with hayden christiansen suiting up as vader as well as a sneak peak at the new x box game star wars battlefront like the laserdisc edition of the star wars trilogy theres audition footage shot on video from featuring a most unlikely mix of actors everyone from kurt russell to william katt theres the usual assortment of trailers tv spots and a few easter eggs along the way the featurettes cover the creation of the lightsaber which has behind the scenes rehearsal footage the characters of star wars and an appreciation by film directors such as steven spielberg and peter jackson if youre wondering how much these films have been cleaned up and improved you need to compare the original theatrical and tv spots to the improved editions the first three discs consists strictly of the movies with audio commentary from lucas sound effects editor ben burtt visual effects supervisor dennis muren and actress carrie fisher all four appear together on a single track cobbled together from different sessions while the result can be a bit distracting at times as theres no interplay between the speakers the result is a film commentary thats well balanced and never boring we get everything from the difficulty in shooting in africa to the origin of r d s voice think baby sounds run through a synthesizer and babbling sliced and diced the commentary track for star wars a new hope tends to be the most interesting because of the fact that lucas was breaking new ground and challenging the preconceptions of the movie studios the star wars trilogy has never looked better and the film has never received such an exhaustive array of extras covering the films the inclusion of the minute documentary provides all the nuts and bolts one needs to know about the films lucas along with spielberg changed the face of entertainment in american film bringing back both a sense of wonder and fun that had been missing while that may have overwhelmed more serious filmmaking it brought back a quality that had been missing for far too long 
the collection of star wars films are the best movies ever made period no discussion no qualifiers these are the best movies ever made and when the final installment was finished all of the movie cameras in the world should have been smashed to pieces and sold for scrap at this point film makers should just give up no one will ever top star wars its impossible not like darth vader isnt luke skywalkers father impossible thats not true thats impossible but like really impossible may the force be with you 
classic trilogy version release history last versions special editions vhs laserdisc dvd versions often erroneously referred to as special editions original theatrical versions adapted to dvd blu ray versions star wars the complete saga episodes i vi blu ray im a first generation star wars fan since having seen the original versions of the original three films in the theater one time each as a child then falling in love with them all over again on vhs in and ive been a huge fan ever since the star wars saga is the ultimate epic space opera and film series this isnt actually a review of the movies most of you reading this will have seen one or more versions of dozens of times although this review will discuss some of the changes made and not made to the films i actually own the six film star wars saga blu ray set linked above and i reviewed that the movie discs in this product are of the same discs from the larger saga set so i thought i would edit that review down to only discuss the classic trilogy discs themselves and post it here this is meant to be an overview with personal observations and select commentary thrown in disc physical qualitiesthe discs themselves are heavy duty yet smooth and well coated with scratch resistance the best available in retail products ive seen the discs themselves do not have any images they are light grey with blue trimmings the movie discs have the previously used logos of star wars with the episode subtitle underneath both on top of the episode number in the form of a large roman numeral the film discsthis is as good a place as any to mention that there are two audio commentary tracks for each of the films of blu ray there are the same ones from the previous dvd versions of these films and then new commentaries compiled from archival interviews with cast and crew i would expect that the word archival to mean pre which should be a real treat for all the purists i dont enjoy listening to commentaries while watching adventure films but i will force myself to listen to the new tracks once as i did for the original dvd commentaries as i have only had one frame of reference for viewing the blu ray films i thought i should first specify what that is in case my experiences are in any way relative to my equipment and viewing conditions this may mean more to you than it does to me my blu ray player is a sony bdp s my hd tv is a sony bravia kdl v a flat screen lcd with a diagonal of a little over a meter my blu ray player and tv are both almost years old my line of vision is exactly to the plane of the tv screen and my eyes and ears are at a height equal to about up from the bottom edge of the screen im sitting such that the distance of my head to the tv screen is a little more than the width of the death stars thermal exhaust port the films on blu rayall three films sound and look awesome in hd i fully appreciate all the pain staking effort that had to go into improving the resolution of over hours of high quality sci fi entertainment frame by frame the millennium falcon is amazingly detailed with all of its charming dents and carbon scoring the death stars seem even bigger and more epic due to the incredible level of detail now visible i could go on and on but youre really just going to have to see it for yourself there is one significant exception in the hd upgrade a very logical and fitting artistic choice was made in the rendering of the holograms of characters throughout the films it looks like the holograms were not upgraded to hd now looking somewhat pixilated compared to the surrounding reality they are projected into this of course is easily explained in universe as they are just not high resolution transmissions and i feel this actually works to improve the illusion of the entire scene seeming real the holograms are now an intentional vestige of the analogue age left behind to honor the origin and evolution of the star wars films themselves which began as motion picture projections but have now become the ultra realistic looking digital media a very nice touch a significant improvement that the hd upgrade also provides is a solution to a common criticism i have ran into since over the years i have heard many star wars fans express that the addition of gc characters and objects into the films seems unrealistic ironically these fans seem to have no trouble accepting the un reality of rubber muppet characters but cg is somehow unacceptable in their vision of the star wars universe well now muppets rubber masks human actors and cg characters can all exist in visual harmony together thanks to the wonders of hd the increase in resolution seems to have unified the apparent realities of them all now the real world elements of the scenes have been raised to the same level of visual reality of the cg elements resulting in the cg elements seeming to much more naturally blend in with their surroundings this adds in a whole new level of visual realism to the films perhaps being the greatest achievement of these new blu ray versions of the films now ill go into more detail about some of the blu ray enhancements and changes specific to each film above i mentioned how great the death stars and the falcon look the asteroid field effects are improved all the way around and cloud city looks fantastic the upgrade to high definition is more noticeable in the original trilogy and thus strikes me as even more stunning overall for the most part the lightsaber effects are improved and match the prequel effects however there are some aspects of some scenes that you can only do so much with without completely new effects the squares around the ships flying in front of outer space are no longer visible but ships flying in front a capital ship still sometimes show a barely noticeable amount of distortion surrounding the smaller ship the snowspeeder cockpits viewed from the pilots point of view are now completely opaque against the hoth landscape but you can still just barely see the moon of endor through hans head and the cockpit of the shuttle tyderium and some distance backgrounds that were previously just out of focus in the original camerawork are now just understandably flat out blurry in hd episode iv a new hopeobi wans simulated krayt dragon roar to scare off the tusken raiders that had attacked luke has been changed yet again while i dont understand lucas need to change it i also dont understand the big uproar this insignificant alteration to the film has caused among fans a live krayt dragon is never seen onscreen anywhere in the film saga whos to say what a fictional off screen animal should sound like i would think lucas is the only one that would even care i certainly dont give a damn what the dragon is supposed to sound like the fictional simulation of a never seen creatures roar only has to convince the fictional sand people not us you may not like a particular sound effect but i think the harsh criticisms i have read about this for any version of the roar for something so inconsequential are ridiculous rocks have been added near the opening of the little cave that r is hiding in when obi wan shows up and the negative criticisms to this are completely unfounded it has been spread throughout the internet that the rocks inexplicably disappear when r is later shown wheeling towards obi wan and luke but the purists that have stated this are totally misinterpreting the scene when r is coming out of hiding the shot is from a different angle than the previous view into the cave and the rocks that had been added to the previous shot would be behind r who is obscuring the mouth of the cave so how are you supposed to see the added rocks through r there is no discontinuity caused by the added rocks and i suspect that some purists are misreporting things in an attempt to fuel the fire of their hatred of lucas and all changes in general i mean there nothing wrong with aesthetically disliking the addition of the rocks in the shots they appear in but it is incorrect to misrepresent a change as creating a new discontinuity in a subsequent shot when it doesnt really do that i dont really like the added rocks but i dont dislike them either because it really has no impact on the scene just like the variations of obi wans dragon roars the details of these two changes are just go in my whatever george file and are then given no more attention and some people say lucas is all ocd about star wars the scene where luke first turns on his fathers lightsaber has been edited more tightly to better conceal the disjointedness that occurred from the original editing of two different takes together to appear as one continuous live action im pleased with that minor but needed improvement and now greedo and han shoot virtually simultaneously more on greedo later the sequelsboth sequels overall look great but almost all the changes were made to rotj while holograms have been left in a lower resolution the force ghosts have been fully upgraded to hd further differentiating between the two effects for the purist muppet lovers out there rest easy yoda and jabba the hutt remain the original muppets theyve always been in the sequels but even the muppets look better in hd and ill throw in here that contrary to false rumors sebastian shaws portrayal of anakin de masked remains unchanged from the previous version of the film besides the upgrade of it to hd episode vi return of the jedithe static shot of the droids moving up to the blast door to jabbas palace is now slightly expanded into a wide pan in to the droids starting with a larger door it adds heightened impression of scale to the beginning of this space opera adventure a nice touch the thawing out of han has been slightly altered so the carbonite seems more like its melting away an improvement to the original effect a dug the species of sebulba in tpm is added walking in an empty space in one shot in the palace not a close up and some people say it looks fake i think it looks better than a lot of the rubber aliens in the palace a few shots of ewoks show them blinking and a couple close ups of wicket show the details of his eyes making ewoks seem more like real animal life forms and less like midgets in suites it does seem like a few tie fighters were added to the battle of endor another improvement made in the interest of increasing the sense of epic scale when r is blasted in front of the shield generator bunker i noticed that the electricity effects were enhanced my wife noticed that they added some gadgets popping out of r ill watch for that next time but since i didnt even notice the new gadgets i doubt i will have any problem with the change no nooo when vader is watching luke getting zapped by the final attack of the emperors sith lightning anakin now says no then as he picks up palpatine anakin more loudly says nooo ive read this described as a scream but that is way overstating it and contrary to what is commonly being reported it is also not quite the extended noooo from rots when vader finds out that padme is dead that may have been the recording they used as a basis but if so it was augmented and shortened for this scene in rotj when looking at the complete star wars saga these two additions of the word no do not seem out of place to me at all obi wan yelled noooo when he saw his jedi master get struck down by darth maul in episode i luke yelled nooo when he saw vader strike down obi wan in episode iv luke has his mega no sequence to vader in episode v no no thats not true thats impossible noooooo noo it seems that now anakin in episode vi is just following in a time honored tradition among his master and son but at the climax of the six film saga its stated at the prevention of the negative outcome this broken man who had killed his wife and jedi master was now sacrificing his life to save their son and destroy the sith master my wife who had made it a game when watching the blu rays to point out every change to the films she noticed made no mention of anakins new nos it seemed so natural and appropriate to her that after seeing the blu ray once she thought they had always been there anakins new nos make perfect sense to me with respect to the entire film saga i have read criticisms that the new nos were out of character for vader well it is not vader who said them it was the buried persona of anakin skywalker who was emerging back to the surface to conquer darth vader the titular jedi who was at that moment returning i like anakins new nos still uncorrected ive long ago accepted the fact that i am a severe minority among first generation star wars fans many of the fans from our generation like to point out things they would change about the prequels or changes to the original trilogy they don t like so now that the films are all so close to perfection i thought i would represent a radical view by going anti purist and provide my fan boy list of things in the classic trilogy that in my opinion still need changed or corrected episode iv a new hopeafter the droids land on tatooine the inside of the escape pods open hatch that was previously blue is now a slightly more realistic looking black in the blu ray but later when the stormtroopers search the area the hatch is still blue what it is a black material than turns blue under the hot suns this is minor point but just seems unfinished lucas has long stated that the cantina scene was incomplete in the original release he ran out of time and money to finish it by now hes had decades no shortage of money and obviously no qualms about revising his movies but one of the two duros has long alien fingers while the other still has normal human hands a little cg fix in a dim background come on and in blu ray it is now more than ever apparent that when ponda baba walrus man is shown at the bar he has fin cup hands instead of the more humanoid hand of the severed arm shown on the floor after obi wan slices it off the anh deleted scenes even have the original shot of the severed fin cup hand on the floor changing it to more humanoid hand in post production for the original release was a completely sensible decision because without a humanoid hand it wasnt very clear what was on the floor but now with all this financial success and time lucas couldnt just go ahead and fix the previous shots of the alien to also have the five fingered hands a couple minor cg fixes come on also i really dont see the need for all that blood on the floor by the severed arm putting the humanoid hand with a gun makes it pretty clear what obi wan had cut off all the other cases of limbs and heads getting chopped off by lightsabers throughout the rest of the film saga do not show any blood in fact the severed body parts sometimes also conveniently disappear from view in watching the blu ray i noticed for the first time that greedos shot didnt leave the slightest mark on the wall near hans head of course i realize that this problem was created by an alteration to the original scene and the reversion back to the original would eliminate this oversight see below for more on greedo in the remote control r was unreliable and often failed so they improvised in some shots where only the top of r is visible by having the live actor that played him just hobble along with his own legs which resulted in r appearing to bob up and down while traveling over a flat surface the character would be rolling across in universe even as a kid i thought that looked ridiculous because r just shouldnt move that way on blu ray the cg r in the prequels looks virtually identical to the live ones in the entire saga so there is really no reason that they couldnt have just corrected the bobbing r shots to one moving in a manner consistent with all the other scenes he is shown rolling in an often pointed out effects problem is the appearance of skywalkers lightsaber blade on the falcon the fix the blu ray applied appeared inconsistent in my viewing sometimes it looked consistent with the saber blades appearance in rots and tesb bold and bluish but other times it still appears weak and turquoise tinted why only fix some of the scene and not all in tesb blu ray it looks like r s blue parts that originally appeared black while in lukes x wing have finally been made blue but in anhs battle of yavin there are still shots of r s blue parts being black that should have been cake to fix them all by now im a huge film score music aficionado tesbs iconic imperial march darth vaders theme was based on the imperial attack theme from anh there was no longer a need for the original imperial attack so it never appeared in the saga outside of anh imperial march was used in the subsequent five star wars films as appropriate when the saga is viewed chronologically the theme appearing significantly in the films taking place before and after anh makes anh seem somewhat at a loss without it i feel it would be appropriate to edit brief phrases of imperial march into anh in two places when vader first appears in the film as he enters leias starship and when vader last appears in the film as he gains control of his tie fighter and flies away thematically that would make a lot of sense without altering the musical landscape of anh as a whole episodes v the empire strikes backit makes perfect sense for walker vehicle motion to be produced with the use of stop motion photography intuitively machines moving in that non organic fashion seems realistic but i have always had a problem with the effect of tauntauns moving i do understand that in claymation was the only way to bring tauntauns to life but the choppy motion looks incredibly fake by todays standards especially on blu ray i still have no problem with the muppet taun tauns used for the close ups but for a couple distant shots they should have cged the tauntaun scenes it seems to me that the scene where han rescues luke on hoth uses a little short cut in the upgrade to hd the scene is now darker which of course means less detail is needed it actually makes the scene more dramatic because it visually supports hans dialogue about it getting dark and there not being much time to get the shelter built to save them both from the cold hoth night but there is one shot of luke laying down in the snow by the dead tauntaun in which the brightest seems to suddenly change is this a glitch from viewing it on my equipment or a flaw in the blu ray itself and in the modern age of ilm there is no longer any need to depend on the live action short sleeve long sleeve effect to portray luke with his hand cut off just fix his really long looking arm with cg and as great as most of the lightsaber battle looks vaders lightsaber still comes across as hot pink in a couple shots so the blu rays almost got all the lightsaber shots fixed in the classic trilogy and at the end of tesb when luke leia and the droids are watching the falcon fly away r s blue parts are still black episodes vi return of the jedilike almost everything on the star wars blu rays the surface of the rancors body looks impressive but the rancor still seems too slow mo to really seem that menacing to me id love it if the rancor is redone in cg to appear both large and not so slow when yoda dies the blu ray still uses the archaic original effect of yodas blanket fading out with yoda while at the same time the blanket without yoda can be seen fading in but not exactly the same position before it falls into the vacuum left by yodas passing so for a time two blankets are visible as yoda fades away it should now be easy to fix this transition by simply adding a cg blanket over both of the original blankets with the cg blanket falling down not unlike the original one did after yoda is completely gone from the shot although it does not appear as much as the lukes long sleeve severed arm in tesb a similar live action effect was used for vader anakin when luke cut off his hand this is more visible when in the close up on anakin after he throws palpatine into the pit the forearm that bends like it has a wrist in the middle of it because in the real world it does but anakin is a cyborg so maybe his forearm also got broken inside the leather suit ok fine but it really stands out when luke is dragging anakin to the shuttle by one hand and one bent forearm that happens to appear just as long as the arm that had the hand cut off cg it future revisions to the films based on lucas pattern since the classic films get changed every years so that alone would indicate that we have another revision to the saga coming by however it has been announced that all films will be re released theatrically in d one at a time starting with episode i in february if the d films come out at the rate of one per year the final episode will come out in which is also the th anniversary of the original star wars film now that i am seeing commercials for d tvs and even d smart phones it seems extremely likely that the films will be re released in a home d format either one at a time or all at once by either way i suspect that ill need a d tv by i doubt that episode i d will have any changes from the blu ray version since it is coming out so soon but there is plenty of time to put further revisions into the rest of the films especially the classic trilogy id be thrilled if they revised anything from my still uncorrected list above lucas wont live forever so i doubt there will be any new versions of the films after the home d versions so when will lucas stop revising his films my guess is how i learned to stop worrying and diverge from g canonwhen my wife and i were watching anh on blu ray we watched the greedo scene and then paused it so my wife could use the restroom while she was gone i went to youtube and watched the original version of the scene in which greedo never shot and i noticed something i had forgotten years ago in the original version of the scene it does not actually show any blaster bolts at all even from han han says yes i bet you have and then it just shows the impact of an attack on greedo it seems obvious that han had shot because han had stealthily drawn his blaster and greedo got hit with something and died but i realized that the original version of the scene actually also allows for the possibility of greedo also getting off a shot and if greedo had gotten a shot off before or at the same time as hans greedo had obviously missed because han was fine however besides it being extremely unlikely that greedo could have possibly even missed han at point lank range there was no blast mark anywhere near han and as mentioned earlier in this review there still isnt then i went back to the blu ray and watched the latest version of the scene again in this re viewing right as han said yes i bet you have something wondrous occurred i sneezed wha how could that possibly be significant ill tell you as you may realize it is impossible to keep our eyes open while sneezing even if only closed a split second yours eyes will close in this case my eyes were closed during the camera shot of the blaster bolts being fired and they reopened when greedo gets blown away i was playing the anh blu ray but because of the sneeze what all i had seen with my eyes was the original version of the film in which no blaster bolts were visible and there was no evidence that greedo had fired his gun at all this made me realize that when watching anh going forward i could enjoy the overall superior blu ray version and all i have to do was close my eyes for split second at the right moment and i personally have restored only han shoots to my personal viewing of the film then i thought about how silly that sounded and after we finished watching the movie that caused me to seriously reexamine my previously self imposed standard of defining my personal star wars canon as including all elements of g canon appearing on screen in the latest version of the films i thought back to lucas statement that there is a star wars multiverse there is his universe the expanded universe of publishing and there is also each fans personally defined universe i had already personally defined my world as being expanded from the lucasverse by diverging from some of lucas statements about some off screen elements of his universe and some of the secondary g canon elements novelizations comic books and radio dramas that do not appear in the films my sw universe has plenty of original elements of my own devising and differing interpretations and explanations of elements not overtly explained or portrayed on screen and my universe includes only some elements of the expanded universe but far from all but i had previously still chosen to not diverge from lucas on screen g canon of the latest versions each film which had included the dramatically inferior greedo getting a shot off at all that ultimately lead to my full embracement of lucas statement that i am completely free to define canon for my own personal star wars universe even if it contradicts his g canon since all my non greedo related criticisms of the blu rays are just visual effects or musical score concerns i have now officially updated my star wars universe to include all the story continuity seen in the blu rays except that greedo doesnt fire at all contrary to how weg statted greedo i still think that greedo was not a pc caliber bounty hunter greedo was just a mook a two bit thug it is likely that he did have to drink some liquid courage to even get up the nerve to confront han and greedo being intoxicated is still a good explanation for how he could possibly not even notice that han had drawn his blaster its still not a huge deal to me but it is undeniably better if greedo never shot i may try to rig up a bookmark device in the blu ray to allow me to skip over the second showing the blaster bolts for when i first show the movie to my son when he is older that way my son will be able to experience the heightened drama of hans moral ambiguity so hans return to help luke at the climax will be that much more satisfying then after the movie is over i will do what the parental guidance rating of the film expects i will discuss the morality of shooting first making it clear that han did not choose to completely become a good guy until the end of the film i think this discussion will even work better than lucas solution to his concern because it will further emphasize that morality is about choices and this goes right along with anakins story arc in the saga i dont need lucas revision to the greedo scene to do my job as a parent for me final wordsyou may not agree with all the opinions i expressed throughout this review but if you are reading this then you must be a star wars fan of some kind on some level if so then do yourself a favor and watch the films on blu ray at least once even if you have no intention of ever owning them youll see much more than i could possibly ever hope to describe in words and if you wish to criticize the blu ray versions after viewing them at least youll then have an educated opinion for doing so in my first viewing of star wars on blu ray the rich star wars multiverse has deepened in a way i couldnt have even imagined before seeing the films on blu ray while still not perfect my favorite films have just gotten an incredible amount better as impossible as it previously seemed im somehow now even more of a star wars fan than i was before but this blu ray release has also reminded me that every version of any star wars film is awesome if you have any questions please feel free the ask if you have also seen the blu rays and want to comment on them with respect to my review please also feel free may the force be with you 
i am not sure that star wars is the best movie trilogy ever but it definitely ranks in the top this box set is an excellent presentation of three movies with a bonus dvd that is actually worth watching in other words it is not just for hard core sw fans the quality of the dvds i bought is perfect to be expected however i was surprised at how much the individual movies were cleaned up i saw the original releases in the theatres when i was a kid i then saw the updated versions when i was in my s now i have seen these new versions and the differences from the originals are dramatic some reviewers have critisized this release because the dvds do not contain the original theatrical versions of the films i do not find this a problem how many of us already own the original theatrical versions on vhs or laser disc adding the original versions onto this dvd series would have only increased the costs to the consumer at only a set i find this to be very reasonable as mentioned above the difference between the updated versions of the movies and these new versions are not so dramatic but the difference between the theatrical and the new releases is astounding all three films have been cleaned and reformated for thx sound and modern special effects the explosions are more crisp the colors more vibrant and the space background more polished very impressive and much appreciated unlike a lot of special dvd releases this dvd series contains bonus material which actually adds to the whole and is worth any extra costs we are paying for the set i had seen many of the vinnetes regarding the making of star wars at different times from different programs to see it all together in documentary format was incredible this series is a true tribute to the fans and welcome departure from the typical rake the consumer for every penny mentallity which seems prevelant in the industry today 
when the star wars special editions were released theatrically back in it was a given that they would be released in dvd a few months later instead they were released in vhs only and rumors were that lucas was going to release the original trilogy in dvd format only after the second trilogy episodes was completed there were grumblings from the fan base that lucas was being greedy in which it forces people to buy the trilogy twice or three times also many from the fan base do not like lucas tweaking the films to paraphrase lucas in the special edition interviews vhs versions a director never completes a film a director merely abandons it thats how he felt about star wars and lucas wanted to complete the films to his vision when one thinks about it hes not changing any story plotlines but just adding a few things visually because of time and money constraints back when the movies were being filmed and to take advantage of the cgi age also as it is shown on those vhs special edition interviews the negative of the original film was all ready deteriorating in such a short period of time and part of the tweaking was to save the film for future generations lastly the further tweaking in the dvd releases are to enhance the bridge between the first trilogy and the next trilogy whatever lucas intent its his films and he should be able to do what he wants to do with them now that the original trilogy is on dvd the dvds have no indication of being the special edition versions from the re release but these are the versions with the changes and there are even a few more surprises included therefore this is the definitive lucas versions at least for now however grumblings should subside because the films look great and lucas didnt wait until the second trilogy was completed or at least the final rd installment was released its probably completed but in post production and editing also it is a marketing ploy to promote the film being released in may overall just watch and have fun dont let the minor additives be a distraction because the overall dynamics and spirit of the films are left intact note a highlight that still thrills this reviewer when han solo chewbacca unexpectedly come back with a great shot of the milennium falcon flying in to help luke during the death star battle scene in a new hope 
quite possibly the most epic collection of science fiction stories ever made it is the brilliantly designed brainchild of creator george lucas telling the tale of the evil senator palpatines rise to power and the legacy of the skywalker family you are wintered into a world where numerous aliens planets vehicles droids weapons technology and culture of a galaxy far far away wrap your greatest imaginations in amazement episode iv a new hope theres a lot of things i could say about this film but im pretty sure most of you reading this have already seen this movie the special effects are fantastic for this film even by todays standards and the character development in this film is one of the best ive seen in years the story will have you on an epic adventure of many proportions so its no wonder this film is still remembered even today although there are certain story elements that arent really original and the story can get predictable at times it doesnt ruin this film george lucas does a great job directing this film and has the story and special effects work together beautifully the soundtrack for this film is superb with so many great memorable scenes like the showdown between obi wan and darth vader or the classic flight scene with luke skywalker this movie will have you cheering and begging for more after its finished episode v the empire strikes back the story gets a little darker with this film and has some very surprising plot twists this movie not only surpasses the original but is a great movie in its own right the acting directing cinematography musical score and special effects are great and compliment the story quite well this movie will have on an emotional roller coaster thatll leave you gasping for more with epic scenes like the showdown between luke skywalker and darth vader or the tragic end han solo faces in this film its no wonder why this film is considered the best out of all the star wars films episode vi return of the jedi what can i say about this third film its another masterpiece in movie history the story can get a little cheesy at times with the ewoks and a bit predictable but it doesnt ruin the experience george lucas not only produced a great story but he also delivered another great musical score and special effects to back it up the original star wars trilogy is one of the best movie series of all time with great moments like the final confrontation luke has with darth vader and the emperor or the touching love story with princess leia and han solo so this movie series never stops being interesting a true classic for any movie fan overall the original trilogy is truly a masterpiece my favorite character in this trilogy is definitely han solo hes got this cocky bad ass attitude that i like i first seen these when my dad bought the trilogy on laserdisc in i loved these after since i watched them for the first time after seeing the original films this dvd box set took awhile to grow on me as i watched episode iv i adapted to the changes the picture and sound are phenomenal the films look like they were made today now that my friends is amazing lucas said he wanted them this way so i guess everyone who wants these on dvd will have to accept that hes never going to give us the originals but these will do 
i watched this movie with my family and we all loved it its a movie version of the iranian hostage crisis i remember that event very well having lived through that period critics have complained that ben afflect demonized the iranian people in this movie i disagree i thought he did a pretty accurate picture of the people in tehran at that time the iranian peoples anger at the u s for allowing their former king the shah of iran to be in our country for medical reason came through the nightly news exactly as shown of course the iranian people had their reason for being angry with the shah but thats another story ben afflect did a wonderful job directing this movie the script moved and the casting was great but keep in mind that this is a movie the concept of creating a fake movie to be carried out by the cia agent tony mendez ben afflect was real all the other stuff i e procuring the passports at the last minute the airport chase etc etc never happened but it made for a good thriller and kept us at the edge of our seats this dvd also has a special feature with the real hostages alongside the actors recalling their experiences it was fun to see them side by side this covert operation was classified until much later when the information was released to the public and was picked up joshua bearman from the wired magazine in we now know that we owe our gratitude for the safe return of the american hostages to tony mendez and to the courageous people who worked in the canadian embassy in iran this movie does not take away from that fact i read in the news that the current iranian government is considering suing argo for making them look bad if they want to sue anyone for making them look bad then they need to sue themselves most of the iranian people are intelligent kind and hard working they are not all religious fanatics i know this for a fact this movie just showed the event and the mood of that period nothing more 
i have seen and read so much about the iran crisis and remember the tensions of the time i cannot believe how fresh this all seemed when i saw argo even though i knew the outcome i was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie it definitely deserved its awards 
i really liked this movie i can see why it was nominated for an oscar great job ben a must see 
award winning movies usually turn out to be a ton of hype and little else i was sure that would be the case here i was wrong a brilliant and gripping look at the iran hostage situation incredible acting brilliant direction everything was perfect definitely worth checking out recommended 
what an excellent movie this is what great film making is all about ben affleck and cast do an excellent job in telling the story of the iran hostage crisis of the dialouge is stellar the acting is superb and the direction also by ben affleck was unmatched he has come a long way in his career and i feel that he will continue to grow as an actor and a director of cinema the costumes were spot on and i loved the historic material that was in the film every actor no matter how small of a part did an excellent job with the material the best movie of no doubt christopher berry
after hearing time and time again how awesome this movie was i was eager to see it myself it did not dissappoint a great movie in itself but when you consider this is based on actual events it boggles the mind 
with two wildly gripping yet commercially underperforming movies under his belt gone baby gone and the town ben affleck finally gets his breakout hit with argo a smart and tense thriller that boasts a terrific cast and intensely engaging story first of all the cast here is amazing say what you want about afflecks gigli days but the actor continues to prove he has what it takes to pull off a challenging role afflecks mendez is meticulous and intelligent yet comfortable in not being recognized for the true hero that he was the actor director surrounds himself with great talent as well such as the men who helped make his plan possible including alan arkin john goodman and bryan cranston the direction is this film is so good and once and for all proves that though i enjoy his roles affleck is a much better director than actor the story never waivers or lingers longer than it should and the introductory scene as well as the white knuckle finale are some of the most tense moments in recent movie history the film also contains a lot of comedic moments mainly as it pokes fun of the movie industry its portraying theres a real dark comedy feel to the film and arkin and goodman especially have some great lines while i cant vouch for the validity of the historical accuracy behind the story the film presented is engaging political and hard to forget the movie is more than deserving of the plethora of awards it received and the hype its obtained any pundits who claimed affleck didnt have the chops to make it as a director in hollywood can finally be silenced with one of the best movies of the year and the academy award for best picture in his hand mr affleck will be able to make any movie he chooses from this point forward and that is something to look forward to 
 argo among the nominees for the best picture academy awards may very well be the best film of and ben affleck may very well be the best director unlike other frontrunners lincoln and zero dark thirty argo is a movie movie like those other two films it tells a true story but unlike those other two disappointing films argo is not a starchy and lumpy docudrama argo is a smoothly running machine argo tells a gripping story in a gripping way never preaching lincoln never getting too caught up in one aspect of the story to distort the narrative line zero dark thirty and lincoln argo wants to entertain you and it does its a thriller my palms were sweating as much while watching this movie as while watching an old fashioned suspense flick by alfred hitchcock even though like most viewers i know how the story ends i found the opening scene of the storming of the us embassy in tehran so frightening i could hardly watch it this is all the more remarkable given that id heard a radio interview in which affleck joked about finding only older actors to perform the part of the students storming the embassy argo s cast is full of actors i know well have seen in many other films and whom i like a lot affleck john goodman alan arkin victor garber bryan cranston its testimony to the films power that i stopped thinking about these actors and got lost in the characters they were playing argo tells the true story of a cia plot to release six americans from iran during the hostage crisis the plot pretend that the six americans are canadians there to scout locations for an upcoming sci fi flick john goodman and alan arkin are utterly believable funny and moving as the hollywood part of the team theres a brilliant throwaway scene in which alan arkin and richard kind bargain over the price of a movie script the scene doesnt advance the plot but the dialogue is perfect and fast its just a witty respite in a tense movie about a life and death situation ben affleck is perfect as a cia operative he keeps his cards very close to his chest farshad farahat plays an amazingly hairy airport guard he screams in farsi most audience members not speaking farsi will have no idea what this man is saying there are no subtitles even so we are terrified farahat deserves an award for his brief but pivotal performance as the face and voice of the enemy the entire world now confronts an enemy driven by incoherent focused murderous rage argo has a little bit of heartwarming family drama a little bit of arcane cia in shop detail a little bit of hollywood behind the scenes banter a very little bit of nightmarish torture it never lingers in one type of scene too long it just glides along telling its story as economically and movingly as possible 
the story is very exciting and i love the self effacing humor hollywood does on itself if you love tension and excitement based on a real life story with some fiction added you will enjoy this movie 
all the characters were well played the story line hung together throughout the movie i especially liked the synopsis that followed the movie it was a feel good movie and it made me wish some of todays current events would turn out as well 
this true story is a cold war era spy thriller that switches over to a hollywood satire and back with almost sorkin esque repartee throughout when our embassy in tehran iran is stormed by ayatollah khomeinis followers six staffers snuck out the back door and hid in the canadian ambassadors house during the commotion the state department keeps coming up with one bad idea after another on how to get them out untilexfiltration expert tony mendez after talking to his son on the phone about the kids tv choices hatches the only viable option claim that the staffers are a canadian film crew scouting locations for astar warsknockoff called argo as theres a persian community in los angeles that could report back to iran that no such production exists if one of their relatives called to check this requires the enlistment ofstar trekmakeup technician john chambers to build up an elaborate cover legend of not only the production company but also the requisite press publicity to make it all plausible and all while the revolutionary guard are going door to door executing anyone who is saying nice things about the us simultaneously tense and hilarious this dramatization of this audacious black op that earned mendez the cias answer to the medal of honor and had to be kept classified in order to prevent retaliation against the hostages they already held is definitely worthy of all its critical accolades the recovering tom clancy fanboy in me enjoyed the old school spycraft angle and the hollywood power player in waiting in me reveled in the portions in la where mendez chambers and the producer they enlist to make it plausible wheel deal and scam their way to that end such as staging an in costume table read for the benefit of the press just to have something in the trades that the iranians could look at it all puts to rest the gops claims that hollywood hates america 
this is a great movie and reminded me of all the things that go on with the government that ordinary citizens know nothing about youll be on the edge of your seat 
great extras a full blu ray with a ton of extra stuff you also get a argo movie poster and poster of their escape plans and ben afflecks cia id im a sucker for those things and most important this movie is brilliant one of the best movies ive seen in a decade i didnt even realize when i first saw it that it was ben affleck he has as grown soooooooo much as an actor and handsome and did an amazing job directing this a must for any movie buff or even non movie buff even my big manly friend shed a tear at the end amazing cast amazing story cheers ben hope to see more stuff like this out of you jess roselle rock the shots

argo is a fast paced thriller but never mindless affleck generates the kind of sustained suspense that one associates with a caper movie which in one sense it is set during the iranian hostage crisis argo is the story of just one of the many exploits of tony mendez cia master of disguise mendez affleck is charged with creating a cover story for the seven hostages that have managed to escape from the american embassy during the first few minutes of the crisis he must spirit them out of iran under the noses of the regime and affleck manages to hold the tension for most of the film like zdt the final half hour is a series of synchronized moves each of which must work argo is so different fromzero dark thirtythat comparisons are useless both are top notch both are true stories and both deserve to be seen at least once anyone interested in the true story written by mendez himself should check out his book the master of disguise my secret life in the cia the full story of argo is the subject of a fascinating book argo how the cia and hollywood pulled off the most audacious rescue in history both are worth the time especially for cia and espionage buffs 
argo follows tony mendez ben affleck as he plans and leads a cia rescue mission during the iran hostage argo is an intense suspenseful and entertaining thriller argos story and storytelling are great i was not familiar with the actual events prior to watching this film but this film managed to spark an interest on the subject the story in this film mostly relies on its extremely suspenseful situations i suppose its even more suspenseful for those unfamiliar with the real story along with the suspense the film also uses drama action and even some comedy in a well balanced and consistent manner plenty of memorable characters and dialogue argo begins with an intense unforgettable raid as you can see the fear and worry in all of the characters preparing for the inevitable the ending of the film the last or so minutes is the definition of suspenseful its a dreadful edge of your seat finale the storytelling is tight and smooth as in its easy to follow and doesnt have much filler content the performances were great the music really helped create the atmosphere tone and authenticity of the film also the credits of this film has a comparison between the film and actual photographs of the events people this segment really showed the attention to detail and the aesthetic authenticity i really liked this the pacing was fast in my opinion and i was fully immersed throughout the full runtime ben afflecks direction was also superb like in his other two films overall argo is a beatifully crafted perfectly executed thriller the film is suspenseful thrilling unique and most importantly very entertaining i highly recommend a purchase if you already have strong doubts about it because it is a critically acclaimed film or because it may not be accurate then i recommend a rental argo has some strong violence and blood 
weve watched a lot of barely worth it to watch movies over the last few months and questioned are there any great movies from finally a round of new releases worth the watch and argo was terrific highly recommend the film as it is well cast with big name players but they dont overshadow one another in this movie the fact it is based on a true story is fascinating and for those of you that remember the overthrow of the shah and the rise of komeni recreated footage is chilling and well done great edge of your seat thriller no sex and very little bad language well done ben affleck 
intense entertaining and definitely an eye opener great cast design and up to speed with the times its a date 
this movie opened my eyes to so many unknwon facts it also made me see my own government from a different view
there are certain movies where even if youve seen it before you still hang on to your seat because the suspense is so taut and as in argo when its based on a true story it makes it even more suspenseful i dont know what the academy was thinking in when they did not elect ben affleck as best director and the movie won an academy award i do suggest as with many movies to watch with close captioning as you will miss some of the dialogue not because of a hearing problem 
great movie very well made and even though we knew the outcome we were stuck in our chairs frozen until they got away 
wow what a movie it surely did deserve the win great effort from ben this would be another one we would love to add to our library great audio and video quality 
awesome show quality of fm from amazons instant video is great this is a must see a showing of history repeating except this outcome is good 
really liked this one immensely did not like bens facial hair lol guess it fit the part i would highly recommend this movie 
a great moviie that keeps you wondering if the hostages will get out of iran great directing and you feel the fright and doubt of all involved this picture is more than deserving of the oscar for best picture of no other picture comes close shame shame on the academey for snubbing ben affleck for director he would have won hands down in my book and katherine bigelow too was snubbed and she at least deserved a nomination for zero dark thirty when is the academey going to give nominations to those who really dedeserve it than just trying to be politically correct to me this is no more than a cope out and whoever does the picking should be fired i have this dvd and ive already watched it twice i would highly recommend this movie to anyone 
argo is ben afflecks third movie he has directed and he is for this movie deals with the iranian hostage crisis in which iranian revolutionaries stormed the american embassy and took everyone hostage but six managed to escape the movie focuses on getting those six out before they are captured and executed the movie begins with a brief history of the region and how the us and british government had controlled the country and its resources for decades until iran revolted and forced the western designated shah out but now demanded he return and face punishment after taking the embassy the cia comes up with a plan to get the six out tony mendez the operative who orchestrated the plan comes up with an idea to create a fake movie and have the six pose as film crew and ultimately get out of the country the acting is very solid ben affleck and bryan cranston do great jobs as the cia agents fronting this mission john goodman and alan arkin are also great as the movie producers fronting the fake movie the last half hour of this film is very intense and nerve wracking and it will have you on the edge of your seat all said and done this is a fast two hour movie that is never boring do give this movie a view if you want to watch a great thriller 
rare is the movie whose outcome you already know that concurrently keeps you in suspense throughout this is one of them amazing 
this was a great movie about the iran hostage crisis and i actually remember seeing this on television when i was younger unfortunately history recently just repeated itself with another embassy tragedy when will we learn this movie is a cautionary tale which is about the past and how it has affected our future five stars 
ben afflecks argo is a smart political drama an exhilarating espionage thriller and a sharp hollywood satire that not only is a successes at all three but manages to be among the very best of its various genres detailing americans first encounter with political islam it is also a love letter to the enchantment of the movies and the power that is yielded the world over by peoples fascination and dreams of movie magic right from the beginning showing the old studio logo for warner bros circa the fastidious detail to the period and the extremes that affleck and his talented cinematographer rodrigo prieto went to to achieve an authentic look to the film are astonishing the movie was filmed on celluloid blown up two hundred times as to allow it a natural graininess prieto also manages to successfully duplicate camera movements from pictures of the particular time and era taking place in that moment when cinema of the s when movies mattered and where cherished personal statements and the s when entering the post star wars era of special effects and endless sequels argo manages to resemble a lost film from the late sydney pollack a movie from that moment in time that like the classics of the era in which it depicts manages to successfully cross meaningful moviemaking with thoroughly entertaining amusement it has been cheekily called the last great movie of the s the strengths in argo are many including the way the movie is able to effectively blend historical fact along with hollywood fiction to make an intelligent electrifying remarkably engaging and funny movie working from the crisp and knowledgeable screenplay of chris terrio based in part on a magazine article by joshua bearman and on tony mendezs autobiographical book the master of disguise argo chronicles a true life tale that is stranger than fiction as the clich eacute goes mendez was a cia exfiltration specialist who brainstorms an idea that would help free six american diplomats placed in harms way during the iranian revolution after managing to flee the american embassy before the terrorist takeover they have found temporary refuge at the canadian ambassadors home the cias plan is to send in bicycles for the americans to ride three hundred miles to safety an operative will be sent in to train them to use said bikes if necessary mendez has a better bad idea using a former agent now working in hollywood he will set up a fake sci fi movie called argo and smuggle the americans out of tehran as members of the crew claiming that they were on a location scouting trip to pull this off he must set everything up as fractural as possible which seems to be the whole feel of the movie both the fictional and real argo the idea comes to mendez from watching a planet of the apes movie a true life case of monkey see no its hard to distinguishes the facts from the artistic license because we know that the truth is so often this way i am reminded that after the events of september that the government did meet with hollywood screenwriters to askfor their input on terrorist scenarios to possibly avoid further attacks i dont wish to know the differences between the reality and the movie reality i am confident that much of the third act is indeed movie formula it feels as such but i dont think that anyone is really going to care because it is so cleverly done and amusing in the process argo is one of the funniest and most droll films this year it understands the absurdity of its situation but never resorts to cheap shots or descends into parody the two major performances here are those of john goodman as real life make up effects artist john chambers mendezs contact in hollywood even better though is the great alan arkin as lester siegel a past his prime movie producer with an abundance of bad attitude and sarcastic remarks to easily steal the show and make off like a bandit with it his foul mouthed cantankerous geriatric will remind audiences of his oscar winning role from little miss sunshine although i think he is funnier here and gets one of the years great lines of comic dialogue its the one that involves the film s title for those who ll be curious later the rest of the cast is remarkably fine as well with numerous strong performances from an abundance of familiar faces including bryan cranston an unbilled philip baker hall clea duvall tate donovan rory cochran victor garber michael parks bob gunton richard kind and a delicious role for scream queen adrienne barbeau who was a star in the era which this is set affleck is nothing if not a generous director when it comes to his actors affleck has had an amazing comeback in recent years now excepted as a first rate filmmaker among the finest actors turned directors with his name mentioned amongst giants such as clint eastwood warren beatty and robert redford argo offers affleck the chance to yet again shine as a leading man his recent roles have been parts of ensembles like excellent the company men and his own terrific achievement the town here affleck is the star and the anchor to this thrilling and suspenseful true life drama im sure many stars could have played the part but affleck is a good actor with movie star charisma and once more is allowed to shine in that capacity affleck has earned the right to star in his movie where many actors direct their favorite star being themselves this is affleck s first time shining the spotlight on himself argo is so accomplished that one never really notices that the story is little more than a routine movie thriller or that we already know the outcome of the events the plot unfolds so captivatingly and afflecks direction is so masterful that the few weaknesses of the picture are never apparent and easily ignorable aided in no small measure because argo is a gripping story with a concrete strong human center for two exhilarating hours it manages to serves up a well spun yarn at time the tension is breathtaking exhilarating to a point of apprehension the history plays in such a way to mirror current events and enlighten those of us too young to recall these events as they happened it is also a very funny and good natured movie full of deserved uplift and celebration of heroes both real and invented see my reviews at moviezonemagazine com
thoroughly enjoyed this movie well acted and they seem to have gotten the period down perfectly the production values were excellent 
the bravery shown by afflecks character and all the terrified potential pows is an inspiration to all americans government service in the diplomatic corps is not for the feint of heart this movie brings the message of that bravery and dedication to a population rapidly loosing sight of our united condition and those heros who must face death and worse daily 
towards the beginning of ben afflecks latest film argo make up artist john chambers played by john goodman says to cia specialist tony mendez affleck even a rhesus monkey can direct a movie this type of tongue in cheek word play signifies a new and deserved confidence from the actor turned auteur argo is formulaic at best in terms of chris terrios screenplay but its afflecks direction and the performances from his cast that raise argo above the bar he set with his previous film the town argo is set during the iranian hostage crisis when a group of iranian militant revolutionaries storm the us embassy in however this film actually recounts a previously unknown and confidential story of six americans who escaped the embassy and were given sanctuary by the canadian ambassador these six are in a unique and treacherous situation of being unknown escapees who if caught could be made examples of by irate militants without complicating the heavily observed hostage crisis at the us embassy their story becomes the focal point of argo as the white house state department and cia all spitball ideas on how to rescue these six trapped americans before they are discovered by the iranians eventually they settle on a long shot idea from mendez which involves posing the escapees as a film crew scouting locations in iran for a fake movie by the name of argo terrios screenplay does a great job of building tension in all the right places but it does so in a sort of screenwriting kind of way in other words its predictable regardless of predictability argo is a deeply involving film just because we laugh when were supposed to laugh and we cry when were supposed to cry it doesnt mean its a bad film instead argo is a perfect team effort at its heart there is a tremendously powerful and amazing story told in an uncomplicated way which is just what every good movie needs at its core additionally it is expertly cast with terrific performances from john goodman bryan cranston and alan arkin who steals scenes as the cantankerous lester siegel arkin and goodman head up the fake film studio needed to validate mendezs plan to disguise the escaped hostages as a film crew here the film adds an enjoyable layer of film geek enthusiasm finally affleck outdoes himself as director argo has a deliberate and even pace some historically iconic staging and camera work that enhances the tone of the film in fact affleck even shows some side by side comparisons between historical photos and some shots from his film in the closing credits his attention to detail brings dimension and realism to the film in a time where real decisions had to be made without the luxury of our modern digital age argo is the first great movie of the fall season and delivers as both a historical snapshot and an edge of your seat thriller this is a very strong effort that succeeds beyond any rhesus monkeys wildest expectations a read more reviews at 
this movie keeps viewers on the edge of their seats seldom do modern films manage to create truly suspenseful situations but this one does the cast is strong and the acting is good due to the oscars this film is now very well known and very popular as indeed it should be even more interesting is the fact that the story line is based on real people and real events at the end of the film there are photographs of the actual people who lived the real life version as it happens the actors are pretty close matches the film also shows a bit about global politics and the relationship between the u s government canada and great britain the canadian officials are shown as courageous and willing to take risks the film also shows the iranian propaganda machine at its best or worst when it denied that the u s embassy personnel were diplomats and claimed them all to be spies a solid real story with good acting and edge of the seat suspense almost from the first minute certainly the last half hour is about as scary as any movie ever has been 
a hostile nation is holding members of the embassy staff hostage while the majority of the state department is focused on those hostages six members of the embassy staff have sought refuge with the canadian ambassador how would you get them out could you get them out thanks to the u s allowing their deposed leader to seek refuge in america the iranian people storm the american embassy on november the staff is rushing to shred or burn all their confidential files the majority of the staff are held hostage while a small percentage escape unnoticed the state department begins planning a rescue and asks the cia to consult its abundantly clear to the agencys exfiltration specialist tony mendez played by ben affleck that the state department is in over their heads with such plans as having the embassy workers ride to the border disguised as teachers on bicycles in winter it was back in his hotel watching battle for the planet of the apes and talking to the son ian played by aidan sussman that tony affleck has an idea disguise the hostages as a film crew and sneak them out right under the enemys nose after bringing the idea to his boss jack odonnell played by bryan cranston the plan gets the go ahead later they approach the make up specialist who worked on the planet of the apes who has also done work for the agency in the past john chambers played by john goodman chambers in turn introduces mendez to a well known producer named lester siegel played by alan arkin once theyve chosen a script argo a science fiction fantasy in the style of star wars they go the extra mile in establishing it as a legitimate enterprise where it was simply a poster in the beginning siegel organizes a table reading with known actors press and studio staff while all this is going on the iranian government has sweatshop labor assembling the shredded photos so that they can identify anyone who they failed to capture also our six escapees become increasingly fearful that they will be discovered im kind of a sucker for movies based on factual events no matter how much the narrative diverges from history a beautiful mind the insider some that dont have russell crowe as the lead actor that said it doesnt guarantee i will like it case in point i found j edgar unbelievably dissatisfying argo on the other hand is brilliant in my opinion the story is gripping the comic relief is hilarious and the suspense has me on the edge of my seat as a lead actor affleck has had some notable flops gigli and surviving christmas among them as the director of gone baby gone the town and now argo however he is now three for three you should definitely see this movie 
everyone who has ever been trying to catch a flight and runs into one delay after another knows on a small scale the tension shown in the movie
i was so proud to watch this movie for so many reasons the cause success history and ben afflecks terrific work 
winning oscar and a controversial movie with tranfer picture very excellent and with audio dts master audio makes film so live and very good documentary in special feature you must own it
i want this movie to be released on k blu ray i love science fiction and this movie while sadly not about aliens was pretty cool the story was original and actors were quite good its a cool movie and soundtrack is just amazing i feel like something might be missing but i cant quite put my hand on what can that be great movie you should see it 
this was a scifi movie that was surprisingly excellent there is no need to discuss the plot or have any spoilers here but i will say the storyline special effects even the soundtrack were excellent i ended up buying this movie for the collection 
this is by far my favorite movie of its hard to tell you much about it without including a spoiler so lets just say it is not only a great action adventure and sci fi movie tom cruise does a tremendous job of creating a somewhat tortured character who you care about it also has beautiful scenery convincing cgi effects and a collection of great actors and actresses i dont pay to watch the same movie twice in the theater much but i did this one and i purchased it as soon as i could once it came out on blu ray 
ive been waiting for a good sci fi movie for a while and oblivion filled the need there is a great story slowly developing to keep the viewer going along for the ride the special effects were well done and the acting is good as well even though im not a tom cruise fan he just keeps putting out good movies if you are a sci fi fan like me grab a soda and some popcorn and travel into the future with this very entertaining story 
we found this to be a better then good story not great this story was made for cruise it was him we enjoyed it completely
oblivion is what science fiction should be it is about an idea not about action it is a story that makes you think spoiler alert we never see the aliens the mystery and discovery aspect of the story makes it easy to ignore that water is about most abundant compound in the known universe so there is no need for aliens to take it from our planet but the nice thing is that is not important it is just a tool being used to tell the rest of a far more interesting story 
im not a tom cruise fan but i am a sci fi addict so needed something new this one is great nice twist at the end morgan freeman is great as always and even tom managed to be believable and not too cocky like most of his movies recommend this one 
science fiction is more than just laser swords and alien space battles at its heart science fiction is about showing how the human condition fairs in a futuristic setting oblivion is the science fiction that those of us who love sci fi have been yearning for it has heart it has spirit realism of character and a plot that is not full of holes or typical contrived hollywood bs if you liked moon then you will love oblivion 
fantastic cinematography with a great cast oblivion really takes it to the next level youll be blown away by the scenic beauty displayed in this movie i wont go into the details of the movie itself as you can get the plot summary from imdb youll enjoy this set thoroughly 
let me first say that i thought directorjoseph kosinskistron legacy was abysmal and apparently a sizable portion of critics and audiences shared my opinion but there were moments watching that i could not help but be impressed kosinski has a great visual eye and shows mastery of lighting and framing there are scenes in the film of startling beauty like wow this movie is actually not all bad colour me intrigued what else could this guy do when he was coupled with arguably hollywoods biggest movie star tom cruise a great supporting cast includingmorgan freemanandolga kurylenko a bigger budget and a promising script based on a six page graphic novel treatment he penned i was ready to give joseph kosinski a second chance i saw oblivion lets see what i thought below movies live or die on their casting so lets talk about that first i understand the doubts about tom cruise but really theres no need for that put aside your thoughts about his personal life the couch jumping katie holmes and all that the role of futuristic drone repairman jack harper is quite possibly among his finest cruise shows he has a real screen presence which when combined with his roguish charm and charisma results in a surprisingly sympathetic and impressive performance cruises character is onscreen of the time so his performance is a big factor in the films power i can safely say that jack harper managed to be interesting cool and emotional without being over the top or sappy kudos to you tom you might not be the finest of actors but youre always fun to watch olga kurylenko andandrea riseboroughboth give excellent performances as the films two female leads respectively the mysterious crash landed astronaut julia and jacks conflicted co member victoria while kurylenkos character brings the love interest and the mysterious flashbacks riseboroughs victoria is much more interesting and strong plotwise in the supporting cast we find morgan freeman who is his usual awesome self as malcolm beech one of the few remaining humans on earth andnikolai coster waldau who brings the muscle and the beard factor to the game fine roles all round and heres another reason to watch oblivion oblivion has the finest cinematography i have seen in a film this year echoing lawrence of arabia and a space odyssey the stunning landscape of iceland comes to vivid awe inspiring life with a minimum of cgi and a maximum of practical effects camera tricks and good olfashioned location shooting crumbling volcanos vast mesas winding canyons valleys endless plains shifting deserts dizzying peaks and open sky are all beautifully shot and with a bit of cgi touch up become the alien ravaged world of seriously see this in imax and you will not be disappointed oblivion is a veritable feast for the eyes the costumes and tech and equipment are amazing as well kosinski chose to go for a more practical route here and the extra work pays off the world of oblivion reminds one of an apple computer or thestar trek but there are telltale signs that this is a lived in breathed in realistic world jack harpers white costumes bears stains and grit his chrome gun is scratched a little bit his baseball cap is faded malcolm beechs leathers are functional and weathered while the garb of astronaut julia is pristine grey and follows the clean lines of nasa form follows function as oblivion designer david simon says and so oblivions equipment the drones the planes the guns the motorcycles the clothes the beds the electronics even the sound of the tech is all designed for maximum realism but thats not to say it doesnt look cool it does i applaud joseph kosinski for his restraint when it came to cgi and his use of practical sets and props heres to more in the future now shall we talk cons oblivion borrows from too many movies to list i see a bit of moon here logans run there a little of star wars there is that a solaris reference i spy as original as oblivion may seem it may all be superficial just on the surface the story has been done plenty of times before just not with this incredible cinematography and eye for detail the climax was slightly out there and didnt reeeally fit the rest of the film tonally but tom cruises memorable one liner is enough to make it worth it all in conclusion oblivion is one of the best science fiction films to come out this year but its a good thing not many sci fi films did come out in because oblivion is not as epic or original as it might want to be thats not to stop the great acting explosive action great sets costumes and cool tech and cool m score from letting you have a great time at the movies my rating four and a half drones out of five but why dont you watch it and see for yourself p s remember the like dislike buttons are not for saying whether you agreed with the reviewer or not but whether the review helped you decide to buy the product if you do not agree with the reviewers opinion use the comments section for that cheers 
i almost didnt buy this because i didnt want to buy the line its got to be good because tom cruise did this but you know what tom cruise only does a movies and he pours his soul into everything he does im glad i purchased this movie and in blu ray its worthy of the blu ray treatment and it merits being in my collection pros strong actors i dont just mean tom but morgan freeman andrea riseborough olga kurylenko nikolaj coster waldau memissa leo they were all fantastic actors in this strong characters storyline that keeps giving cool concept its got tom cruise im one of those people that dont want to like tom just because every second of his real life life is examined under a microscope and marketed to the ends of the world in end i do like the actor hes a talented hardworking actor and deserves the a listing this movie brought me back to respecting the actor good character development even the minor characters have a depth to them like nikolaj coster waldau who only gets a few minutes on camera but wow does he make the best of them and victoria wow she and tom have to carry a good third of the movie alone and together so she does a tremendous job here best supporting comes to mind consnoneno spoilers here you really have to watch the movie the aliens invade we push them back tom cruise is some kind of drone repair guy are there unanswered questions in the movie yes most certainly but the movie is very good at helping you suspend disbelief with its strong visual portrayal sound strong acting to me two phrases are very important in sci fi rational acting and plausible reality are the actors doing rational things in the movie yes if youre ask yourself during a movie why did he do that thats dumb then the actors are not acting rationally is the story plausible yes its science fiction but yes its plausible and yes you have to suspend disbelief just a bit some have compared this movie to prometheus a science fiction mess of a movie and it takes a lot for a guy like me to hang such a label on a movie in prometheus the actors are not doing rational things and the story is not really plausible it makes no sense the plot is not rational so it is categorically unfair to compare these two movies simply because both of their opening sequences are pretty in the visual sense oblivions actors by contrast are strong rational a tight story plot that keeps giving and the story is plausible that is a huge difference couple that with tom cruise and the casts strong acting beautiful filming and you have quite literally a masterpiece of science fiction one final thing some people critique that they figured it out pretty fast but i sincerely dont think the movie is meant to keep anything secret from the audience a la sixth sense i think its a journey of discovery for tom cruises character hes the one figuring things out we the audience are just along for the ride 
oblivion is a refreshing addition to the sci fi realm the story is fantastic and its backed by a great cast the premise involves an alien ai that poses as god cloning and manipulating human beings in order to pillage planet earth for its most abundant and valuable resource water as the plot unfolds the protagonist played by tom cruise naturally struggles to make sense of his existence and win back the planet while protecting his long lost true love i highly recommend this one for sci fi fans 
bought the movie and watched at home like it so much i rented it on my kindle for a flight so i could watch again 
liked the movie anything with morgan freeman and tom cruise has to be great and it does with the digital copy i can watch it any time on my computer
 was a great year to be a science fiction movie fan more than sci fi films were released all with great potential to be be top notch to be honest i didnt have high hopes for oblivion if only because the other films looked so strong by comparison oblivion exceeded my expectations and then some i wont go into the storyline as many other reviewers already have i will say that yes certain elements are derivitive there are parts of independence day the matrix and other rather good btw sci fi stories in the plot of oblivion however at no point did i feel that any other film was being ripped off oblivion has enough of its own original ideas and variation of classic themes to make it stand on its own new and old ideas both come together and make a rather satisfying film tom cruise is solid here as is morgan freeman is he ever in a bad movie the rest of the cast especially andrea riseborough are both believable and relatable i especially enjoyed melissa leo as sally definitely an interesting take on the character she portrays lastly both the special effects and score were great both added quite a lot to the film ive watched it numerous times and highly recommend it 
oblivion wasnt a dynamic bang em up annihilate the universe sci fi it was steady uncomplicated and extremely enjoyable cruises performance is good not a big fan of his but he does have that charisma that is caught on film and makes it work extremely well the premise was really good the plot was a twist i did not even anticipate but it was a really nice surprise for a sci fi flick the visuals and special effects are outstanding overall it was an extremely enjoyable and entertaining saturday night movie for you sci fi fans who need a fix give this a look see highly recommend 
yes this is another post apocolyptic movie but do not under estimate this movie if you are a scifi fan like myself just be patient the story takes place years after earth demise aliens invaded the planet leaving the human race hanging by a thread it may not seem like it but the humans won the war tom cruise character is joined by his girlfriend and coworker as the two remaining human on earth to rid the planet of lingering aliens while cruise is left on his bounty hunting expedentions his gal pal is left at the home base watching a far until cruise discovers the truth this movie is extremely scifi but this is a huge twist that will draw you into the movie even more good movie 
the movie had me in its grip in moments the home they lived in was very sci fi like initially i thought his partner was a hologram i guess they wanted me to think that i really enjoyed the scenes with cruise flying as well as the scenes into the earths openings in the stadium and of course at the lake each scene was done so well and made the story line fluid i believed at just the point when i was wondering what was happening things started kickin the plot was much more intriguing than i thought earlier in the show its complications were unsettling and made for a terrific and powerful movie the characters were all stellar the fx were truly inspiring and the story was compelling i have watched it four times and will enjoy it again and again we have a tv room and had a group of our sci fi friends over and they also found oblivion top notch 
after watching the tv trailers for this film i had absolutely no interest in it they emphasized the scene in the library which made this movie look just like any of dozens of pseudo sci fi fight the monsters in the dark films ive enjoyed some films of that type but after years theyve worn thin by now just for the heck of it my wife and i just watched this on streaming video and found a very different film than expected with a few action scenes worked in here and there this is actually a very thoughtful and surprising post apocalyptic sci fi story set about years in the future the earth has reportedly won a war with alien invaders by resorting to the nuclear option the relatively few people left have abandoned earth to live on titan a large moon of jupiter and the few people left hanging around are protecting large machines that are generating needed power for the colony by sucking up the earths oceans tom cruise plays jack one of these survivors whose job is to repair weaponized drones which protect the power generating machines along with a female partner they spend their nights in a luxurious base and their days working to find and repair drones downed by the remnants of the invading army the surprises in this film wont be shocking for highly experienced sci fi fans but their gradual revelation makes for a very intriguing and very thoughtful story jacks increasing self awareness and his struggle to arrive at the truth is a fascinating story which is degrees different than the movie suggested by the ads and trust me thats a good thing well any more than this and id be getting to spoiler territory as if there likely arent hundreds of reviews with spoilers out there anyway lol ill just say that we found this to be an excellent film with plot twists that kept us guessing for quite some time cruise leads a cast full of the excellent acting performances that drive this first rate plot the special effects are clean and convincing the hd streaming version looks great although the dialogue at times seems to be a bit low compared to the surrounding ambient noise and audio effects highly recommended 
i was unsure how this movie was going to be after watching it im kicking myself for not going to see it in the theater great pllot the twist was just as good the fact it had morgan freeman in it was the best fyi i remember watching him on the electric company still a great actor tom too 
love this movie it starts out slow but with a obvious note to something more going on with the movie you learn the twisted story line that finishes with a twist its a must have tom cruise and you got to love morgan freeman awesome actor 
im not usually a huge tom cruise fan but when i saw the trailers for oblivion i knew id be watching the movie im so glad i did this movie was gorgeous on blu ray special effects were stunning i was sitting here during the movie trying to pick out all the earth sites that i could identify that werent totally destroyed sound quality was super subtitling was done well im partially deaf and it makes a huge difference to me in the enjoyment of films i watch the storyline was easy to follow which doesnt always happen in newer sci fi films there were a lot of twists and turns but i followed them all or at least im pretty sure i did this one is a keeper im sure ill be watching it again 
i originally watched this because my husband forced me to and turned out to really like it the acting is good the effects are good and i think the storyline is great i think this movie is a good metaphor for our lives how we believe reality is one way until we learn something different and it changes our lives plus its quite a little love story too definitely watch it 
i am not one to write reviews of movies that try to emulate professionals critics i just write about what i like tom cruise has not been one of my favorites in the past but he played a great role in this movie as did everyone else in the movie this is a great not good great science fiction movie in my humble opinion the effects were great scenery was amazing and the story was damn good as usual with a list movies there was great production values lighting cutting music dialog etc and honestly this story was intriguing and very interesting if you like good sci fi you will like this movie 
it has been a great movie with a plot that changed every once in a while and throw you off beautiful music cg scenes and effects at their best and the acting is surprisingly good from mr cruise mr freeman is as always exceeding his last movie he is always good and gives credence to the story 
oblivion staring tom cruise a movie that will go down for a long time as being one of the greats when an alien race comes to earth wanting all it resources and the moon is destroyed causing everythingy to go haywire on earth with a war that ends in humans wanting to colonized a moon of saturn or is it thingys r not what they seem to be tom cruise and others have been lied to action and suspense around every corner and every second a twist and turn that will blow your mind a mind bender for sure of what is going on and what will happen next a love story that will go down in space and earth history is also presented totally awesome more than stars and more than thumbs up something that could happen one day hail oblivion 
knowing and seeing are two different things in the future is not a pretty picture but there can be life and wonders around the corner just waiting to happen
this movie is awesome so this is what earth would look like after the moon is destroyed and alien robots attack and then take two astronauts and clone them and wipe out their memory well i hope i dont live to see that day i thought that this movie has a great story excellent actors cruise and freeman the movie was a little slow at times but got very interesting towards the end i though that it was made well done even if it had slow parts in the movie the actors did a great job and the special effects were sweet this is a great movie if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
a great movie we enjoyed watching it and other family members also enjoyed watching the movie and we loaned it to some friends i hope they enjoy it as much as we did 
the movie was great very entertaining enjoyed the special effects the combination of freeman and cruise made this movie i will see it again 
this flick is first class all the way great sci fy concept and some real thought about plot and stringing the movie into on piece i would like to give it six stars if i could 
im a big sci fi fan i have been kind of off tom cruise after he managed open his mouth and stick his foot in his mouth so many times when i saw the previews of the movie they looked good and i was encouraged that morgan freeman also starred in this movie when i saw the movie it was very well written it had a small cast but each of the primary characters were very well done by the actors this movie had great special effects i liked how the set was both futuristic but also demonstrated all of the destruction on the planet i also really enjoyed how the screenplay slowly revealed what was really going on despite the way things seemed that was quite a twist in the storyline there were quite a few things on the set of this movie that took real vision to set just the right atmosphere necessary for this movie kudos i enjoyed this movie so much that i had to add it to my collection i was thrilled when i found the blu ray dvd and digital copy edition on sale just before christmas i have really developed a preference for buying movies that have a digital copy available whenever its possible now i can even watch this movie and enjoy it with a collection of other digital movies on my pc i really enjoyed this movie i recommend this movie to other sci fi fans i hope you enjoy it as well 
i really do feel that the critics who reviewed and did not like this movie dont like science fiction to begin with if thats the case stick with your period films and drunk weekend pics this movie was great from start to finish special effects are really good and i felt the story was a very good one and did not get lost in the array of eye popping effects im not a big tom cruise fan but he did a great job as did the other actors in this film glad i bought this to include in my large dvd library 
this was a good movie that kept you watching every scene very beautiful and scary the plot was so good it developed slowly then evolved into a real surprise by the end would recommend it to those who really love science fiction 
actually tom cruise has come back to earth in real life and his being cast in a sci fi movie occurring right here on earth is quite appropriate but i love a good sci fi movie and this one is pretty good it evokes emotions like space odyssey beautiful you dont like the acting what are you comparing it to its tom cruise hey he does all his own stunts convincingly hes no j nicholson or a hopkins but hes not a bad actor im glad hes come back to reality again in real life you think there is too much cgi too digital again what are you comparing it to are you sure you knew you were watching a sci fi movie actually if you watch the making of on the blu ray it explains there is a lot more reality in the movie than you might think and less cgi but its a modern science fiction movie cgi is required to tell the story but i think this movie is a perfect balance the drones are the coolest even though they are villains i love the noises they make kind of like r d on steroids the score is fantastic you can watch the movie with only the score playing thats a little weird but the score can probably stand on its own if you are into just listening to a movie soundtrack by itself one question i have about one of the characters vika is why are her eyes so dilated all the time it is spooky looking why i am writing a review of this movie that hundreds of people have already given their dumb opinions of i dont know just thought i would offer mine because i liked it so much besides the movie the making of is a very interesting documentary its in parts and in hd as well its almost as good as the movie itself i own the blu ray and the video is of outstanding quality cant comment on the audio since i have not watched it with surround 
not only is it an interesting movie concept but somewhere along the way tom cruise learned how to act he actually plays the part rather than the usual awful job he does in movies for years ive avoided all his movies because he simply sucked as an actor id give this one a thumbs up and i love that the movie was filmed in iceland wow its beautiful 
ive been waiting on a great sci fi film since district and this one is real solid imo great acting music story special effects an awesome package cruise and freeman really nailed their parts and what a twisting plot i like that this movie makes you think for yourself rather than spoon feeding everything to you 
like any movie ymmv for instance my lady friend didnt just dislike this movie she hated it even though she really likes tom cruise then again there are very few movies with a sci fi theme that she thinks is worthwhile its simply not her cup of tea and while its not her most hated sci fi movie prometheus probably gets that honor there was nothing she liked about oblivion there are many outstanding reviews that ive read here especially m olesons that give intricate and informative details on the storyline so ill take a slightly different approach obviously i really liked oblivion i also liked prometheus and for several reasons first i enjoyed the story one major and a few minor plot holes not withstanding oh weve seen variations of this story many times but that doesnt mean i lost interest there were times i knew it was purposely oblique but thought it stood up really well when taken in total this is the type of movie where a second viewing may be warranted ive watched it multiple times secondly the picture quality is absolutely top tier stark and pristine and so were the sets in a word stunning thirdly the soundtrack its an incredible soaring soundtrack throughout that really pulls you in and doesnt let go and finally the depth of the bass this movie will shake your walls and slam your body hard if one has the equipment with clean powerful bass there is one scene where they use a bass sweep that hits single digits below hz that will put a smile on just about any face this blu rays sound capability will far surpass what any theater can reproduce even the arclight in hollywood theaters simply cant plumb the depths that a well integrated home theater with powerful subwoofers can nor do they try its simply not feasible to try and reach anything below hz due to the sheer volume of a large theater rating picture quality out of i have never seen better sound quality out of did i mention the incredible bass and the impressively soaring and dramatic score story and presentation marginal out of i had a few issues with parts of the storyline overall marginal out of which means that i highly recommend it summary if you like sci fi and have a nice home theater with some potent subwoofers i cant think of a better movie to showcase as an example war of the worlds is renown for its impressively potent and stellar bass dvd and blu ray are equally as good and rated stars on avs and oblivion blu ray is just as impressive 
is a very good move was not expecting much from this movie with all the drama surrounding tom cruises personal life buti have to say that this was a very good movie and the acting was very good story line and special effects were very good very original story line highly reccomend this movie to watch
a simply exceptional film in acting writing plot choreography and undercurrent the plot leaves you reeling stunned and provoked the secondary actors are supportive but not excellent but the plot writing and main character acting carries the film and creates and exceptional experience the film is set in the future the aliens are quite a surprise a result of excellent writing and production and the twists and turns of the plot are invigorating 
creative fast paced excellent story good character development and the special effects are superb one of the few recent movies i intend to buy in bluray for my tangible library as with other star reviewers i too am saddened to see this movie bashed but i acknowledge the diversity of perception and right of all to their own view but what are they using as the criteria for or a reference about good science fiction if you consider yourself a person that appreciates sensitive dramatic creative mind challenging scifi then take a risk and see this i am confident you will be pleased you did then you too can write a review based on the facts as you see them 
this is a must watch for fans of sci fi as it is truly visionary film conceptually and stunning in its cinematography ordinary film goers should also consider seeing this in theaters for the thrilling action and fascinating mind games oblivion offers to the audience a moving tale of the transcendence of love and a provocative examination of conscience home memory and what it means to be truly human for a full review search for my blog pulling on the push door and look for the oblivion review 
ok i will not rehash the plot of the story as many reviewers before be had already done so all i can say is that i loved the movie now in regards to the bluray disc depending on the type of player you have and the speed of your internet might want to disconnect your internet from the bluray player before you try to watch the disc i have high speed internet access high enough that i can stream hd movies from amazon without buffering but the disc took almost minutes to load as it accessed the internet to download more bloody trailers and being a universal disc it would not let me bypass the previews by pressing top menu or title menu however i found that by removing the bluray player from the internet the disc started to play right away with no delays hope that this helps anyone who ends up with a blank screen for more then minutes on the universal titles 
this is visually stunning sf while i was watching it i was so grateful someone actually invested the money to make this film because it is that rare film you can just turn the sound off or play only the soundtrack and give the eyes a feast tom cruise gets a bad rap and i think unfairly because of some of his antics and his religion i dont really care about either his antics have never hurt anyone and so far as i know his religion hasnt either yes i know there are allegations of abuse but that is true of any religion and any atheist group as well but he delivers yet again another terrific performance something he has done more consistently than any actor over the past years the rest of the cast but i have to point out maybe the most surprising performance in the film and right up there with cruise that of andrea riseborough as victoria i think the scavs were a disappointment however and that is why i take off half a star yes morgan freeman is good but they never seemed real to me within the confines of the universe the director had created small criticism since they really arent as prominent as they should have been but no spoilers here i was able to watch the film without any foreknowledge and i enjoyed it as such i wouldnt want to ruin that for anyone the ending there are great and surprising moments leading up to the penultimate scene in the film it is an odd scene which is by turns stunning and somewhat pedantic it didnt rise up to the level of the expectations i had built but i enjoyed the ride so much getting there that i didnt matter and i have to admit i did enjoy the very final scene even though i saw it coming the extras are very good tom cruise is always interesting in his commentaries as he is here with the director he is not just an actor playing a part he puts real thought into the film and has great appreciation for everything involved in making a film as a skill 
they should turn the concept of this movie into a tv series i think it is just that good i find myself watching this movie over and over like i do with the star wars movies you can tell this movie was done with a lot of pride and attention to detail that goes for the crew and the cast both and the musical scoring is powerful in my opinion the visual effects lets just say eye candy theyre so excellent all of this is why i keep putting the disc back into my bd player for continued encore performances the picture quality of this bd is stunning the sound quality is uber fantastic if you have a dts hd master audio a v receiver with a channel surround sound system the soundtrack has great lows the windows in the house vibrate on certain scenes id recommend this movie to anybody especially if you like sci fi and action this movie is underrated its a glorious gem 
this is my first new science fiction movie ive seen in quite a while and was well worth viewing the entire cast did a good job with acting performance and visual and sound effects are excellent in comparison to other science fiction movies such as independence day the action in this one is much slower but entertains from start to finish the story is intriguing and i was content with the part that tom cruise played ive seen him in other science fiction movies and his acting fits well within this thrilling story there is enough events going on throughout the film to hold your attention along with suspense for the final conclusion overall enjoyable and highly entertaining recommended to all those who enjoy thrilling science fiction movies 
loved this movie i have never watched a movie of this type without appreciating it to the fullest i hope this genre never dies out and continues forever 
at this point ive seen this movie three times twice in a normal theater and once in imax that might give you a hint as to where im going with this first a quick disclaimer i loved tron legacy also directed by joseph kosinksi who directs this film partially because of nostalgia but more because i absolutely loved two aspects of the film which are present here as well the beautiful visuals of the productions design and the epic soundtrack from daft punk i wasnt too sure id love oblivion but it looked cool big sci fi fan and had a nice bit of mystery about whats really going on in the trailers i will keep this spoiler free as i think the events of the movie and where it goes are part of the fun the basic plot summary is jack harper tom cruise and victoria andrea riseborough are part of a team thats left on earth to help with clean up after the earth was devastated by an alien invasion the world is barely recognizable and most of the survivors save for jack and victoria are either on titan or on the space station orbiting the planet called the tet the pair work on watching over the drones that are guarding huge water collectors that are pulling earths oceans to take with the remaining humans to titan jack is the technician who flies in a dragonfly shaped ship running patrols and rescuing downed drones the drones are there and are being downed by a remaining contingent of the alien invasion that are scattered about the planet as the commercials said we won the war but lost the planet victoria acts as jacks controller using telemetry to help jack while relaying orders coming from the tets mission controller the rest youll have to find out by watching the film itself as i said was beautiful everything from the landscapes to the architecture of the tower the duo reside in are just visually stunning they filmed much of the outdoor scenes in iceland with its large expanses of desolate arctic tundra and volcanic soil the director joseph kosinksi has a background in architecture and it shows in the designs of the tower and vehicles the story is based on a graphic novel that the director had written and was talking about after tron legacys release another reason i love the film is tied to my love for william gibsons novels im a big fan of concise dialog there isnt a lot of hand holding here and while the story makes sense if youre open to it the first time through watching it a second time helps as youll realize why a certain character was a bit distant and laughed awkwardly at a specific moment ignore people going on about the reality of the environment and such its a movie people i wont go into those sorts of things here though im happy to discuss in the comments where people cant see just no rants please just know that there are a couple of twists on the way to the conclusion that turn things on its head the music was composed by m with the help of joseph trapanese and its a great electronic ride ive got the album off itunes and personally i like to remove the incidental pieces that were obviously specific to a scene i guess they all are but some are just better off in a movie and not blaring from your speakers even so there are a lot of good pieces i love waking up and a couple others i wont mention since the names could give away something and even though im not typically a fan of vocals over some of these great pieces the one track with vocals has been winning me over each time i hear it as the director himself put it he wanted to create an environment that was desolate but beautiful as a sort of from tron legacy where everything was dark but colorful i think he did a great job i love the fact that he used giant screens projecting video his crew filmed at the top of haleakala volcano in maui surrounding the tower set so the clouds you see are real not cgi that plus the tower set was lit with the light from those projections so you really feel like theyre living in a tower above the clouds on the acting front honestly dont expect oscar winning performances im not saying theyre bad im just saying this isnt schindlers list tom cruise does a great job playing his character but i think its more because the character fits him than because hes pulling a daniel day lewis and transforming himself the other characters play their roles well hello morgan freeman and game of thrones fans will get a small treat from a lannister that all said please ignore the critics reviews i read through a bunch and they were all saying the same thing that the movie wasnt original that it didnt break new ground in anything and blah blah it annoys me to no end when i read reviews by these people who do nothing but review movies nice job and somehow expect every movie that comes out needs to be never before seen and every performance needs to be some sort of incredible experience that goes into history annals and gets taught at film school the movie tells a story thats original even if elements are going to be similar to other stories cmon science fiction has been around for generations weve covered most of it the director does a great job of putting it all together and explaining the parts that need explaining unless you absolutely hate any of the actors especially tom cruise since hes central to much of the story or arent really a fan of sci fi though id argue the science fiction aspects really dont matter beyond being tools to tell a fictional story this should be an enjoyable watch if youre unsure feel free to rent it first because as with all things there are many opinions and what i like may be what you hate if you liked the style of tron legacy are a fan of tom cruise in general like sci fi or all of the above definitely go for this movie if not rent it and decide i think the marketing of the movie might have hurt it a bit along with those critic reviews since this is not that much of an action film its more thoughtful hopefully youll enjoy it 
ok so i didnt get all the essential plot points on first viewing it was a long day after all still i find im liking this film more with each showing even with all the familiar themes hes the one happy boys need cool toys the atlantic ocean you should have seen it in the old days if this is paradise why am i in heels oblivion has tweaked my curiosity enough for many future watches what more can anyone hope for when purchasing yet another dvd for that over crowded video library 
a genuine science fiction story haunting and believable with superb acting by tom hanks morgan freeman and other cast members unusual alien invasion plot using clones of some human beings to destroy remaining human population dramatic ending a standout feature of this sci fi is the great soundtrack by the m memorable film 
cruise delivers a star performance as expected he never gives any less its all here great story action and the unexpected great sci fi recommended watch 
first of all it should be noted that i am a huge lover of futuristic movies with aliens the interesting plot gorgeous landscapes and cgi put this movie near the top of my most favorite movies despite its less than stellar performance in theaters i feel like this movie is quite undervalued quick plot no spoilers jack harper tom cruise is an engineer who has been tasked with maintaining a fleet of drones that are assisting in the salvaging of earth in the year years after a devastating alien attack humanity won the war with the aliens called scavs but earth was rendered uninhabitable in the process along with his partner victoria andrea riseborough jack counts down the days until their term on earth will be finished and they can rejoin the rest of humanity on the space station tet that orbits earth and will leave for saturns moon titan once salvage is complete one day a mysterious spaceship crashes down to earth and sends jack down a path that will lead him to the horrifying truth of tet and his own existence 
i am not a tom cruise fan but he is outstanding in this movie very good story line and something new for hollywood tom cruises scientology joke of an issue withstanding i would recommend this movie 
a great futuristic apocalyptically movie very good story line and lots of action to keep you involved in the movie theres several story lines to follow and it keeps you going till the end 
this movie is a success on many levels its visually attractive it has an engaging plot it drops you right into the grinder just when you were getting comfy i like it 
i really liked this film in many ways the cinematography and special effects were spectacular and the acting was very good tom cruise doesnt alway impress me in films with his acting but in this film he did a good job i just love morgan freeman and he helped this movie with a strong performance the entire cast actually did a good job i actually liked the plot of the film and it made for an interesting storyline that was entertaining it had enough twists and turns to keep you thinking i think the film was much better than many people give it credit i wont go into any spoilers but the film is worth watching at least once and for the special effects maybe even twice it is an interesting sci fi story this is the reason i watch movies i do wish that there was more interaction with the invading aliens and that part of the storyline could had been enhanced and it would had made the film even better for me the film was about a but since that rating is not allowed i will make if a star i would watch it again 
where oblivion succeeds most is as a pure sensory experience i suggest you watch this film on the biggest screen possible with the volume loud very few movies look or sound as good as this one does three elements make this movie worth watching and owning on blu ray the design the technology and architecture is amazing you can tell that the production design was given a great deal of care in fact many of the designs come directly from the directors graphic novel i think the bubbleship is an amazing vehicle and a great design movies like this present exciting possibilities for what future technology might look like and thats something i enjoy contemplating the locations i love when movies take you to places that you might never get to visit in person a lot of this movie was shot in real locations in particular the amazing landscapes of iceland rather than on soundstages with bluescreen its also interesting to see recognizable landmarks the pentagon the washington monument empire state building etc deserted and destroyed of course the destruction is all thanks to visual effects but it looks very realistic the soundtrack the original music for the film was written by m and its the best movie score of the year the soundtrack perfectly compliments the visuals in fact the blu ray has an isolated score so you can watch the movie with only the music no dialogue or sound effects watching the movie this way illustrates how much of the story can be conveyed through the music alone a lot of the criticisms of the movie deal with the fact that the movie is derivative that it borrows ideas from other films i would not dispute that claim i would just say that not every movie is going to be groundbreaking in terms of story or plot i think there are enough ideas in this movie to keep it interesting even if ive seen it all before i havent seen it quite like this 
very good movie lots of action good surround sound great scenery you really cant go wrong with these fine actors 
i loved this amazing movie very futuristic yet realistic an other amazing performance of tom cruise this movie is in my book a real work of art and will become a classic 
it has been quite some time since i have had the pleasure to see such a fantastic sci fi thriller the story is smart and engaging the film is incredibly detailed and stylistically mindblowing it has been incredibly photographed and superbly edited the actors are great as well the soundtrack is pulse pounding and atmospheric so i guess most of the professional reviewers who give this movie bad grades obviously have quite strange ideas what makes a film great and what doesnt as far as im concerned i couldnt be happier with how oblivion turned out great imagery is not contrary to good storytelling in fact good movies tell aspects of the story through their visuals as is the case with oblivion i believe joseph kosinski is definitely the most interesting and talented director starting his career in the last few years for sure i give this film my highest recommendation and i am really diappointed that even a piece of work and art such as this mostly gets bashed by people who would probably never come up with anything like it themselves 
wow what a great sci fi movie how did this one slip through the hollywood machine it has a real plot action love and cool tech gore is even kept to the minimum needed to tell the story huh how did this happen please hollywood i want some more like this 
i really liked this movie it was action packed and it had a good story line and a ending that i didnt see coming t c was excellent in his role as usual i really wish people would stop judging him for his personal life and beliefs because they are really missing out on some good movies that he stars in i for one am so tired of these fly by night one hit movie wonder actors who holly wood is trying to make them out to be an a list movie star when they are clearly not i like real actors who can carry a whole movie and tom certainly fits the bill dont sleep on t cs movies i highly recommend this one and all the ones hes recently starred in 
i thought this was a fun movie it had all kinds of twists and a pretty cool love story to boot i thought the details where awesome and it was action packed i am no critic and i was hesitant about this one but i thought it was great i would totally recommend it 
remember how excited you were to see prometheus last year the would be prequel to alien remember the disappointment now check out universals oblivion for a better story characters we can like and terrific visuals yes tom cruise adds another admirable science fiction film to a list that includes minority report and war of the worlds oblivion from universal studios plays to a smarter audience requiring us to pay attention and think i like that in a movie no matter what the genre i also like the co stars morgan freeman andrea riseborough and olga kurylenko directed by joseph kosinski of tron legacy oblivion is based on his story that was originally intended as a graphic novel a sample chapter was handed out at the san diego comic com cruise got a look and approached him to develop it as a film instead the story blends character with mystery outstanding effects and futuristic toys set in a beautiful desolation as kosinski calls his world in the five part making of feature he explains he was inspired by shows i liked as a kid like the twilight zone movies like silent running omega man s films with a small cast of characters but big ideas the year is the moon has been destroyed by invading aliens and while the humans fought back and won earth has been destroyed by tidal waves tsunamis volcanoes and nuclear blasts the surviving population now lives on saturns moon titan cruise and riseboroughs characters jack and vika have stayed behind to repair security drones and safeguard fusion converters emptying the oceans for transport to titan via a massive mothership scavs surviving aliens are the problem trying to sabotage these efforts the two have been voluntarily mind wiped to focus on their jobs but jack continues to experience flashbacks to a pre invasion new york city and a woman he cant put a name to kosinkis images were used by oblivions design department one of the most important is a glass house the sky tower set on a very delicate foundation structure feet above the earths surface it took five months to figure out how the metal supported design could be constructed even though it was never built except as a set onstage the crew used front screen project a technique stanley kubrick developed for a space odyssey by using this instead of green screen cloud formations filmed feet above sea level in hd were front projected on a circular screen surrounding the sky tower set glass and reflective surfaces even the actors eyes reflect the skyscapes during scenes creating an even deeper sense of visual authenticity it looks perfect on the p transfer detail throughout the film is absolutely flawless its definitely one of the best pictures to be found on blu ray this year location filming was done in iceland where more of kosinkis imagings such as a bubble ship and streamlined motorcycle that fits inside were created a pilot cruise helped design a functioning interior for the gyro spinning cockpit of the ship the actor who turned during filming received an oblivion motorcycle to keep an immersive dts hd master audio mix utilizes surround speakers to their best effect dialogue ambient sound effects and a great score by m blend beautifully one of the extra features is an isolated track in dolby true hd that allows us to watch the movie with its score alone additional extras include four deleted scenes which further explain a few movie moments and a technical commentary by kosinski and cruise most of their information is covered in the splendid making of series as usual dont watch the extras until after viewing the movie unless you like spoilers kay reynolds
 oblivion is great this is how the story goes jack harper tom cruise serves as a security repairmen stationed on an evacuated earth part of a massive operation to extract vital resources after decades of war with a terrifying alien threat who still scavenges whats left of our planet jacks mission is almost complete in a matter of two weeks he will join the remaining survivors on a lunar colony far from the war torn world he has long called home living in and patrolling the breathtaking skies from thousands of feet above jacks soaring existence is brought crashing down after he rescues a beautiful stranger from a downed spacecraft drawn to jack through a connection that transcends logic her arrival triggers a chain of events that forces him to question everything he thought he knew with a reality that is shattered as he discovers shocking truths that connect him to earth of the past jack will be pushed to a heroism he didnt know he contained within the fate of humanity now rests solely in the hands of a man who believed our world was soon to be lost forever the cast led by tom cruise as jack harper morgan freeman as beech is great the directing by joseph kosinski who also produced wrote the screenplay and the comic book of which the movie is based on is great the screenplay by kosinski karl gajdusek michael arndt which is based on the comic book by kosinski arvid nelson is great the music by m joseph trapanese anthony gonzalez is great the cinematography by claudio miranda is great the film editing by richard francis bruce is great the casting by marcia ross is great the production design by darren gilford is great the art direction by joseph bahran todd cherniawsky james clyne kevin ishioka is great the set decoration by ronald r reiss set designs by steve cooper joseph hiura robert andrew johnson jeff markwith maya shimoguchi randall d wilkins set dressings by frank hendrick kevin c lang daniel newton meagan skerchock is great the costume design by marlene stewart is great the special effects coordinated by eggert ketilsson supervised by michael meinardus is great the visual effects coordinated by danielle bemis patrick halm chelsea kammeyer zhunan li sebastian meszmann elizabeth montes hayley perkins sharina radia cara samuels deborah r scott julia smola adrian steel shanshan xie siyun yi supervised by eric barba bjorn mayer is great the stunts coordinated by robert alonzo joey box is great this is a well done well crafted sci fi action adventure film that is entertaining and well made this is a film that also has an interesting and intriguingly done concept that is or has been solidly interpreted on film tom cruise gives a solidly great performance as jack harper joseph kosinski has crafted a film that is completely different and original from his previous film tron legacy the sequel to tron this is one of the best sci fi films of the year and probably one of the best films of the spring season as well 
first i am not a real fan of science fiction but i saw this movie in the theatre and i really liked it so much so that i purchased it tom cruise does more than a credible job of being curious about a world that he protects while performing a routine that is the same every day spectacular special effects that were also credible and a plot that has many twists and turns enjoyable and entertaining 
this film had a very inventive premise and captivating science fiction elements much better than the reviews much better than elysium 
liked the twists and turns in the plot similar to how i felt after watching the lathe of heaven you knew something was wrong but had no real hint of how truly bad it was 
a surprisingly good scifi movie tom cruise pulls off another good character story line was refreshing and a joy to watch 
 nd time watching it and its even better you catch things you missed on the first viewing have to admit that im a diehard scifi lover and gamer aspects of this movie remind me of the mmo eve online which made it that much more pleasurable i need more movies like this 
enjoyed this movie and i usually do not like tom cruise but this is a enjoyable movie to watch you will like it 
i braced myself at first thinking this would another cruise movie but was pleasantly surprised many reviewers have stated the plot is a repeat of many other sci fi movies but this film s delivery is what makes it so enjoyable and that alone deserves kudos the cinematography is beautiful and offers many details for the eyes pair this with the movie s soundtrack and you get a wonderfully complimented pair that adds new twists from start to finish the cast is excellentso we follow cruise onto future earth as all humans have left for a safer planet while he and his stand in wife riseborough work together to patrol the earth s resources and protect their mining sites the story now begins with an inquisitive cruise who presses to uncover the war the earth s resources the truth behind a mysterious crash site and the cause of his dreams who the scavs really are and how he can start over overall i highly recommend watching this flick to the science fiction fans 
warning spoilers here seldom do i like a movie so much that i watch it twice in one week to me this was a very thought provoking scifi film it was also a great love story and i thought tom cruise did a good job acting whats the mind blowing scifi concept to me in this film is that our soul stays with us even if were cloned and as the character jack says in the film if we have souls theyre made of the love we share undimmed by time unbound by death so even though there are many clones of jack he remembers the love he had for his wife so the question is if were cloned do we live forever do we have more than one soul does each of jacks clones have a soul as time goes on he remembers more and more the idea of our existence our consciousness being transferred to a clone boggles my mind would it really be me in the end jack says i am him he said for three years i searched for the house you built i knew it had to be out there because i know him julia and jack stare at each other from across the lake jack voice over i am him julias child points at jack julias child whos that jack voice over i am jack harper and i am home jack smiles some have mentioned the unemotional nature of the way the statements were made i prefer that to ham handed overly emotional acting to me i could imagine myself in that situation and i think i would have been about the same not overly emotional the overwhelming reality of what happened to jack and vica and their legion of clones is amazing and the visuals of a future destroyed earth were some of the best ive ever seen in a future earth movie lastly it ended so well so uplifting and happy to me the road ripped my guts out and the visuals were much more spare and the same with the book of eli there were some stunning visuals but they left you wanting much more oblivion has wonderful visuals shocking and stunning and they were satisfying i didnt really need to see more they showed you enough that you got it without over doing it to me this is one of the best scifi films i have ever seen i loved it also wanted to mention nikolaj coster waldau his role was pretty small but still a good one and in the end when he smiles and hes got one of the greatest smiles and it was perfectly timed i hope to see a lot more of him in future films 
this movie is absolutely beautiful to watch and a delight to hear a new home theater demo disc to be sure it is sci fi but not necessarily an action movie there is a difference there are very action heavy scenes but the movie focuses more on the character and mood not the whiz bang action and explosions tell me if this sounds familiar a movie comes out that is action based sci fi and people complain that its vapid and soulless then a sci fi movie comes out that tries to be soulful or character driven and its panned as boring yet if it succeeds as either of these its called derivative im sick of sci fi nerd hater culture if you like sci fi without being an overly critical nit picking hater then you should be able to find plenty in this movie to enjoy the cinematography alone is worth the price is it perfect no but it is certainly not terrible or cringe worthy 
i usually write product reviews but this time i wanted to give you my opinion of oblivion yes its a sci fi movie with action and its also a drama of course its got tom cruise playing the lead role of jack tom did a good job in this movie especially the action scenes the motocross riding and the confrontation scenes with the scavs i was a little disappointed in his aha moment with olga kurylenko playing the role of julia on the empire state building i mean really the only thing he could say about a previous relationship was thats impossible over and over with little emotion hmmmmm how would that make you feel how about some jumping up and down on opras couch ok that was a little harsh but the rest of the movie he is flawless and how did morgan freeman do he was good he played the role of outsmarting his enemy well with a smile albeit somewhat hidden but curiously given away in his new found cheek bones bulging with glee nearly permanently thats not a bad thing because it wasnt over done and quite refreshing actually there is something that i would call more than determined when a person has a permanent smile focused perhaps knowing that you have finally figured out the enemy and can hardly contain yourself i was a little mystified of the pairing between andrea riseborough playing victoria who is work partners with tom cruise playing the role of jack ok she just seemed a little young i guess she looks beautiful of course nearly twenty something yet work partners who share the same house and bed with jack who looks well at least years old but yet they seem to be an effective team but what the heck do aliens know anyways which brings me to the next point the plot yes it was good and out of the box for sure i mean why send your brother aliens to battle when you can send well something else doesnt that make more sense anyways its what we do in our world right now and how about those special effects truly how do you get a square foot home complete with plexiglass bottom olympic size pool airport tower landing pad medical bay a shop to fix drones and up to feet in the air supported on a single needle metal structure and have it look so freaking real bravo thats impossible lol stars or was that or stars 
first this films plot makes this one of the greatest sci fi films i have ever watched many great scientists have warned us that searching for alien life could be catastrophic that being said the acting was excellent the sound and visual effects are superb this film will go into my personal collection i recommend you purchase this film for your collection as well 
i enjoyed it a lot not much more to say other than that its not a movie short on emotion or dialogue which is unique to find in a modern day holywood sci fi flicks that usually have shallow plots with cgi galore this movie is colorful and beautiful in comparison to the usually dark and sepia toned post apocalyptic movies 
tom cruise can put forth a good performance hes not a great actor but hes a very good one when scientology doesnt get in the way of his brains functioning that cult can make people into robots here he overcomes the brainwashing to put in a very good performance he has to carry the film basically and he deserves a lot of credit for it this movie is a complicated film that is extremely well done in fact its one of the better sci fi films that i have seen in a while something that the great tv show the outer limits would have done without any big effects though and this is spectacular in the special effects realm it would have been better in d though i will say that if someone in a review tells you the plot of this movie then avoid it other than if they say aliens destroyed the earth and tom is stopping the scaves then you will not know what is happening and that is the best way to watch this top notch sci fi film the rest of the cast other than the other tech are in very small parts morgan freedman and a few others have small parts but they do a good job this is movie that you cant just half watch you have to watch it and learn whats happening as it goes along it has a surprise in store for you i cant imagine any sci fi fan not enjoying this movie the effects are so stunning and the story is excellent even years ago this type of movie would have been impossible to film properly its taking place in years but the tech does work when you see the ending till then i was like how did mankind get this advanced so watch this and find out the blu ray is stunning more recent movies always look fantastic on blu and this one especially so there are four deleted scenes that should have been put back in to the film as they were very short and one of them the archive is important to the story this is worth watching its a na movie of the highest caliber 
i loved it i will definitely watch this again many times i can only say that about a few movies 
there may be spoilers some critics have panned this new film from director and co writer joseph kosinski in this his second film tron legacy as being highly derivative but lets face it how many films are so fresh and new that they delve into uncharted territory in any case dont care whether its a drama a comedy a horror movie or even a romantic comedy its how well it is delivered that counts and this film delivers like tron the film is visually arresting seen on a big screen the sets are huge but sparse drawing the audience in set in a war ravaged earth of devoid of humans all of whom have resettled on a moon of saturn only jack terrific tom cruise and victoria andrea riseborough remain they are partners both romantic and professionally whose mission is to watch over the drones that patrol the area for a smattering of scavs who were the defeated invaders while earth won the war they lost the planet which continues to be harvested for water and other ecological matter jack is the investigative repair man who goes out alone victoria never leaves their high control point and guides him using sophisticated tracking technology while investigating an unusual radio beacon jack witnesses a spacecraft crash one of the survivors is a human flight officer named julia olga kurylenko who he has occasionally dreamed about both jack and vic have had their memories washed in order to eliminate thoughts of the terrible war uh sure what jack believes to be scavs turns out to be beech morgan freeman and his collection of survivors the truth is out there and jack must find it and does with the help of julia like tron oblivion is beautiful to watch and has a great soundtrack mostly provided by french electronic band m yes oblivion borrows from a list of movies too long to mention but for those of us who salivate for science fiction films with a breath of intelligence this one does the trick blu ray review in this subsequent viewing of this terrific sci fi film i was able to tie up a few elements i didnt quite understand the first time around i would also have to say this is one of the best looking movies of any genre ive seen the special features on the blu ray disc add some clarity on how and why the filmmakers went for a certain look and it truly comes across beautifully the other thing i had missed the first time around was the romantic relationship between jack and victoria and subsequently julia it was there but just wasnt a point of focus by there i mean it wasnt explicit either by subdued actions or love making regarding the later the most interesting coupling occurs in the swimming pool it seems clear that jacks relationship with victoria seems forced or maybe expected is a better word he does all the right things that husbands and wives do but it seems like a matter of routine more than true love watch cruises face during those intimate close ups something is wrong of course those memory flashbacks of julia dont help when jack finally does find julia it all clicks not quickly but you can see in jacks reactions he loves this woman but why in the end he shows how much he loves her oblivion is also a beautiful love story there is nothing like watching a beautiful movie like this on the big screen but this blu ray transfer comes damn close the p transfer is spectacular in every respect and certainly will be a show off piece to a good system it comes in the original aspect ratio of and does a great job replicating the original film the dystopian world is now essentially uninhabited and the stark whites and various shades contrast nicely with deep dark blacks when the story moves underground shadows and shadings of grey prevail but even when jack retreats to his cabin in the wilderness we get beautiful greens and various earth tones in all their splendor i could see no encoding issues the contrast and detail are excellent equaling the visuals is a magnificent dts hd master audio audio track again put this one on your demo list if you have sub woofers they will get a workout as the rumbles coming from many sources including gunfire rockets and explosions the surrounds are constantly in play with movement from side to side back and forth as the drone ships fly around dialog is clear and well presented ambient noise is ever present as well extras include an excellent commentary track by tom cruise and director joseph kosinski a minute making of documentary some deleted scenes and get this an isolated musical score by m in dolby truhd bit khz a great package to own 
expected a but ended up with stars the story was typical boy loses girl people lose planet boy gets girl back people get planet back spoiler but what i loved was how it was told the cinematography was beautiful perfect editing great acting amazing script and very cool tech toys tc might be crazy in real life but i tell you what hes a damn fine actor 
i am usually not a fan of science fiction but i really liked this movie it is visually stunning the acting is great the story is good i like that it goes at a slower pace than most modern movies the music was great i will go see it again and buy the dvd when it comes out 
i loved this movie ever since i went to the theater to see it i love the twist that this movie has and the scenery a good sci fi movie 
as a long time science fiction fan recent films in the genre have disappointed me so oblivion was a breath of fresh air and gives me hope for more good science fiction to eventually emerge highly recommended 
what a beautiful rendition of sci fi fiction simply fabulous and breath taking panaromas great perspective toward life in another words this movie is intelligently mind boggling do yourself a favor and go watch it dont go by those rotten reviews scattered all over the internet this movie deserve not because it has tom cruise only but the way post apocalypse scenario is shown whao beautifully told story tet or ted i dunno sally in it reminded me of hal from space odyssey 
i cant remember how long it has been since i have seen a classic sci fi movie all the recent entries in the genre have been either superhero movies or bombastic boom boom shoot em up alien invasion ones and while oblivion does tread familiar ground sometimes it gets stars by comparison with its peers in the industry at the moment on its own it is technically superb with a great sweeping soundtrack well presented minimalist art direction stunning landscapes great acting from a small and excellent cast and tight screenplay that keeps your attention if you have been longing from a reprieve of movies with giant ball of fires every minutes this movie also manages to stand on its own without the need for sequels which probably means it gets another stars just for that from the end credits it seems that it has been adapted from an unpublished graphic novel and the writer of said novel directs this movie so i guess i saw his vision of his book and its only after i came here that i realized that he directed tron legacy too another excellent movie hats off to joseph kosinski whatever you think about tom cruise he sure as heck can deliver a great action sci fi movie this one revolves around him and he carries it effortlessly while displaying a wide variety of emotions ever so subtly his supporting cast is very good in general but i thought that andrea risenborough displayed a wider set of emotions really well and it probably would have been better if she and olga kurylenko had switched roles morgan freeman coster waldau and leo deliver excellent performances with the little screen time they have and to be honest i really like movies where the director manages to make a story around a small set of characters work well this is a very good sci fi movie if you have ever read sci fi short stories dick asimov etc and ever wondered how it would be on film this would be a good example 
really enjoyed the entire movie and what a great ending kind of a little sad and happy too makes you think 
i dislike tom cruise in just about everything however he proved himself with far and away id been waiting so very long to see him stop being so nuts and actually do some real acting finally he has done it whats great is he clearly has matured as an actor no more silly films like he did early in his career this thing is epic and true sci fi im happy he was in it and glad hes in edge of tomorrow which is also just fantastic bravo 
i have come to really love tom cruise ans an actor he is down to earth and not all about himself i have been surprised over and over again to love his professionalism and leave all the other parts of himself behind and really just deliver his character in the movie he plays for again having the kindle hd quality to view the movies on is a whole enjoyable experience in itself this time i downloaded it which eneabled me to watch it in places i may not have had wifi connection on 
when i first saw a trailer for oblivion i felt like it was custom made for me then last night while watching it in imax they started playing a led zeppelin song in the movie i knew it was made for me oblivion was a mix of the greatest sci fi already made and yet it was still unique in its own way other reviewers have said that the writing is better in the first half and that the movie becomes predictable or not as strong in the second half i completely disagree i felt like the script while borrowing bits from other sci fi remained engaging and well done through out the whole movie if you see this movie in imax in addition to being blown away by the incredible surround sound you will actually see more of the picture than in a traditional theater they opened it up for most of the movie there were a few parts only one i noticed was around the beginning where it was the more narrow widescreen picture for the rest of the time it filled up the huge imax screen the special effects details set design sound design music and acting were all top notch in oblivion well olga was about as good as you can expect from her the best part about this movie was that my wife liked it she said it didnt stress her out too much she also loved the way the music went with the movie she thought the surround sound and sound effects were some of the best shes heard in a long time she said she wants to see it again just for the sound i highly recommend this movie i liked how by the end all loose ends are tied up and everything makes sense this movie does give you the opportunity to think deeper on the meaning or you can just take what they give you and be totally fine go see it in imax i wonder when tom cruise will start looking his age a note on the content of the pg rating sci fi violence on a star wars level of graphic ness language that is low to middle of the road for pg there is f word as is normal for pg now a days and a few s words and sobs religious exclamations were very minimal like two i think there is a pool scene where you see a dark silhouette of rear female nudity then you can see it through the water for a short time also in another scene we see a bare female back from the waist up thanks for reading now go watch this in imax go in with an open mind and be ready to have fun blu ray update ill keep this brief the picture and sound are perfect the only downside is that the blu ray does not include the imax aspect ratio change it stays in the whole time the special features are actually really satisfying and it doesnt take that long to get through them if you want to see how any aspect of this movie was made you will see in the making of portion if you are like my wife and feel that the behind the scenes stuff ruins movies then dont watch this part because it definitely uncovers the magic behind key scenes the audio commentary with the director and tom cruise was extremely interesting and entertaining the musical score isolated audio track was actually really engaging and showed off the beautiful score the deleted scenes added a bit of depth overall it is a fantastic blu ray of an awesome movie this movie holds up to repeat viewings because youll notice new stuff each time enjoy 
im not a big sci fi person but this was a great movie watch quite often never get tired of it 
stayed true to the story no over the top stuff liked it a lot would recommend to sci fi lovers
i read a few of the reviews before watching this movie and i almost did not watch it i am glad i did i read that the plot did not make sense i think the plot makes perfect sense and is interesting as well as ingenious as well as sweet i will make one small criticism the perfect home and machines that the humans live and work in seem too perfect to be true but i think that the alien tech entity could easily maintain them another small complaint we are supposed to believe that this fantastic technological entity still needs humans to repair some of the machines i believe that this is probable just look at our own world machines are always breaking down and one other small criticism we only see one small group of survivors actually i prefer this some movies like the matrix try to show too much and thereby become less interesting so you see that all my criticisms actually are not criticisms at all this story is solid well told moves along swiftly and is continually interesting even the schmaltzy parts are perfect there is one small but important scene which cries out for the perfect soundtrack song i found myself thinking that this would be the perfect place to play a whiter shade of pale and it plays the inevitable ending has two two surprises that actually took me by surprise i felt warm and happy and satisfied 
i rented this since i am a cruise fan and pretty much see all his stuff automatically after viewing it i bought the blu ray i knew i would want to see it several more times while i actually liked the story i was particularly drawn to all the sets the house in the sky the pool the earth landscape the cool plane he flies even the drones i found it easy to become immersed in that world which made the actual story less important watching the extra features greatly enhanced my enjoyment as well a lot of work went into making this movie look the way it does five stars all around from me edited to add i notice that a lot of reviews are complaining that it was too digitized and too many special effects how ironic that the producers would go to such lengths for realism as shown in the extra features and they were so successful that the assumption is that its all fake the vast barren earth scenes are real shot in iceland the scenes out the windows of the sky house are actual photographs of clouds and sunrise set projected onto a degree screen surrounding the house no blue or green screens surprisingly little of this film was cgi 
tom cruise has been impressive in his recent releases and this one is no exception i first watched it having only the expectation of disappointment and i was pleasantly surprised this concept is really cool and you will not be disappointed at all i talk about it all the time to the doubters like myself check it out 
say what you will about tom cruise and of his off screen persona most of what id have to say would be negative but he is a great actor who almost always delivers and this is one of his best performances this is a thinking mans science fiction flick not only is it visually stunning with some nifty cgi special effects it also has an intelligently written script with dialogue that is ofttimes poetic as the opening quote exemplifies set in years after earth is invaded by alien beings called scavengers scavs who destroy the moon resulting in a tectonic upheaval that combined with nuclear weapons used to defeat the aliens have resulted in earth becoming virtually uninhabitable the remaining humans inhabit a huge space station and have established a colony on titan one of the moons of saturn cruise as jack harper is tech who is responsible for patrolling the radiation free sections of earth and for maintenance of drone warships that hunt down the remaining scavs he is assisted by his communications officer and lover victoria andrea riseborough at the end of one of his patrols the odyssey a nasa spaceship crashes and in the only survivor is a mysterious female julia olga kurylenko but things are not exactly as they seem be prepared for some surprises beginning with the appearance julia and malcolm beech morgan freeman who leads an underground stronghold of humans produced directed and written by joseph kosinski he gets triple credit for its excellence if you love the genre as much as i do you will love this outstanding sci fi flick 
i dont expect much from movies nowadays as most movies rely on cg and explosions to make it worthy of your time and money oblivion wasnt like that this movie relied on the plot and great acting yes it had wonderful cg the visual of earths destruction with m s musical score made you feel the loss of home and all that it represents but oblivion went beyond the visual no matter what you may feel about tom cruise love him or hate him he is a great actor and an even better protagonist because he sucks you into the story he makes you believe the unbelievable the antagonist is also great evil is beautiful and perfect and a lie i hate spoilers so i wont give anything away but i would recommend this scifi flick to anyone who likes a good story with great visuals great action scenes and makes you go hmm when its over 
i almost didnt get this movie because the critics tore it apart however after reading the reviews on amazon i decided to buy it i am glad i did everyone agrees that this movie is visually stunning it is but lets get past that right off the bat you are made to think about what is happening you have the strange feeling that something isnt quite what it appears but you dont know what funny but that is exactly the feeling of tom cruises character throughout the movie it takes twists and turns that you didnt expect the video and audio are excellent the casting was great look if you need a guy with an intense stare that doesnt quite know what is going on tom cruise is perfect if you need someone to project that he really does know what is going on morgan freeman is the natural choice the rest of the cast was excellent each portraying their characters to a tee special credit to melissa leo for adding some incipient creepiness which was fun to watch now why did i ignore all those one star reviews first those who said the movie was bad because they didnt understand it put the blame in the wrong place second those who cried bad science need to understand that the movie is entertainment not education sure hydrogen is the most available element in the universe but that does not prevent some visually interesting ways of obtaining it yes the story borrowed from other works the final destruction of the orbiting platform was straight out of id but it made sense in the context of this movie and that is what really matters 
i had no plans to follow through with this movie lately every movie ive been waiting to go to dvd has let me down the previews rock my world only to find i cant sit through fifteen minutes grrh oblivion had a couple things going for it before i even pressed play science fiction and tom cruise i live for end of the world survival drama and toms been one of my favorite actors since legend the movie starts off with a monkeys vibe because the opening scene is a glimpse of the past tell me you all saw that movie it is one of the best of all time the pacing is slow with long looks and minimal dialogue but the tech is sleek and sexy everything is white or feels white clean even the ruins but then darkness and unknowns are thrown in which is the least flashy way a movie can create conflict and i loved it quiet spooky stuff then the music came into play and i was thrown into a terminator vibe very futuristic everyone is going to die via machine kind of way i loved it i was completely creeped out tom played one of his most subdued roles ever almost funny at times morgan freemen excels at that and he did here too theres a mystery to be solved humanity to save and the last man on earth to get laid okay toms not the last man on earth but here he is getting some and the world has ended that was a little too much but at least it was very understated which pays respect to how sci fi movies should be except when it comes to the modern version of battlestar galatica they had the best sex scenes stars for oblivion and im sure ill watch it again because its that cool one more movie vibe reference wall e weird but let me know if you see what im saying here 
i l ove movies like this one this movie i think anyways is one of his best acting roles its a fantastic movie and i dont have any regrets in buying this movie amazon u did well i have reciieved the movie i ordered i got it earlyi feel everyone should buy this moviethis movie is like star wars in a way tom cruise and morgan freeman does a real great job acting in this movie 
i really enjoyed the movie i just finished watching it it was a very exciting futuristic movie it had great special effects 
this movie didnt wow a lot of people in the theaters but i absolutely loved it awesome special effects great story superb acting wonderful action astounding ending i truly enjoyed this movie there are two scenes that may not be suitable for younger audiences great movie highly recommend 
you will like this movie great special effects and cinamatography and suprise ending didnt see it coming but loved it 
thank you brother for keep making the kick ass good ones sci fi forever this movie is great special effects really good plot is solid and first rate the special effects make this movie along with tom and olga and the whole cast as a sci fi fan and action fan it is up to par the director did a fabulous job here the surface of the earth is what blew my mind most very well done 
this movie really flew under the radar but it is definitely worth checking out a rare uplifting movie in the post apocalyptic sci fi genre with a positive message check it out 
this guy just cant do any wrong as an actor i dont care how crazy everyone says he is i love his movies all of them and the guy just keeps the action rockin
all my many reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the film from standard def dvd quality to the higher standard set for blu ray summaries of the plot and opinions of the story line and acting can be found in the majority of the other reviews so i do not want to be redundant keep in mind however that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the tv monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using the monitor i use is a fairly new panasonic zt plasma and the amps speakers cables bluray player and surround processor i use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective video the video transfer is nothing short of excellent colors are very realistic and contrast is excellent allowing you to see very small detailing in the background and foreground in a few of the darker and shadow scenes details were not lost blacks are fully deep and no banding can be seen in either the blacks or sky shots which is often where you would see such banding color saturation has been boosted a touch but nothing that distracts from the imaging at no point did i notice any cgi haloing or artificiality within the image itself being a newer film the blu ray was free from artifacts or dropouts of any kind mbps rate stayed in the steady mid thirties even this could have been improved without the video ads and movie previews will get to those later audio so glad that production houses are finally starting to include a audio mix this is the first blu ray i have seen that actually defaults to the audio if your system is still a system not to fret the additional th and th channels will be muxed to feed into your th and th rear channels without any issues the lossless dts hd ma audio mix is quite excellent with a wide use of discreet directionality to your surrounds with much panning between the front and rear stages to create an enveloping film and aural experience your lfe channel will not be ignored as there is plenty in this film that will keep it occupied dialogue is clear and transparent and foley effects absolutely delineated for your ears there will be no need to play roller coaster with your remotes volume control once you set it to your liking extras the one clearly negative thing about this blu ray is that there are ads and previews of other films you are paying for their advertising which takes up room on the blu ray calling for even more video compression in order to fit it all in who wants to pay for an advertisement not me id rather have an improved video transfer with less compression the real extras are deleted scenes which were good enough to make for an extended version and a making of documentary divided up into several parts covering the creation of the ships stunt work which tom cruise takes pride in doing the inception of the film and more additionally there is a separate musical score you can listen to the digital copy that is included allows you to download via ultra violet which i do not like or to itunes which i do i am glad that i have the choice to go one way or the other with this this is an fx laden science fiction film to be honest i must say that i was disappointed in the movie itself i was thinking that it was a sci fi chick flick but i know many will disagree effects are great but a movie should be about the characters and storyline and not fx never the less the production values of this blu ray are outstanding and well worth purchasing despite the included advertisements i do hope that this review which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to blu ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase all of my reviews are of this nature and i hope they can be of help to you as well thanks for reading 
while i have enjoyed some of his work i was surprised to see him actually step into full blown science fiction i didnt know what to expect when i sat down to watch it but was pleasantly surprised a well thought out story with a dynamic chemistry between characters watch out for their definition of a drone its not all technology and a superb final scene check it out 
i really did enjoy this movie it was filled with visual wonders great acting and even love there were triumphs tragedies and even plot twists that kept me watching this entire movie im a big sci fi fan but even if you arent give this movie a try it left me with thoughts of future tech powers and even a sadness at what we might become besides tom cruises fine acting there is also an excellent supporting cast notably morgan freeman 
this was even better than i had expected it seems to get you involved plenty of action and shooting but notlike most these days tastefully done the plot seems to run right but leaves you wondering whats up and as thestory unfolds yes there is a story hahaha you get more into it a little more confusion near the end butyou will get all the answers and an excellent ending even though you might not think so at first it is thoughtprovoking and heartfelt more than just the usual shoot em up sci fi enjoy i know you will 
this is what a blu ray is supposed to be like the picture quality is perfect if you have a good home theater system the sound will blow you away 
despite what some reviewers have said about oblivion that it reminds them of other science fiction films this is surely a keeper in my collection of great science fiction movies most of the reminders of other films the reviewers pointed out can be found in any science fiction from almost any year i wont go into detail because i think the claims are unwarranted criticisms of oblivion some of the films critics said it copied from were films that were written after oblivion the original treatment for the film was written by the director joseph kosinski in nonetheless all science fiction films borrow from multiple sources most likely from science itself i cannot recall the exact details of what was borrowed but i do remember that they were pretty common traits of many science fiction stories either way if you enjoyed oblivion as much as i did i think keeping it around is a great idea ive installed it on my ipad so i can watch it any time 
i will be the first to admit that i have been put off by reports of toms personal life however this movie proves he is indeed a very talented actor i was immediately drawn into this movie and the gorgeous scenery and the story line that pulled you along for the ride the story was revealed at an appropriate pace and there were intense scenes scattered throughout that had you on the edge of your seat one of the most enjoyable movies ive seen in awhile 
its hard to neatly categorize oblivion obviously its a sci fi movie with amazing visuals of spectacular flying machines and a ruined earth but its also a strong drama and a tender love story the one problem i had was it takes a while slowly building up to the movies surprise you know somethings coming but it takes its time im not a huge fan of tom cruise but his acting was great 
too many reviewers are giving away to much plot one of the things that keep this movie going is that there are several plot surprises throughout the film some of the reasons i liked this movie was because it is a fairly original idea as to how earth was attacked why and by whom not going to tell you the relationship with his female partner and back up if in trouble make them a very effective team the whole story about what his job is or may be is good tom cruise has memories but they cant be true and the women he dreams about it is scary and sad to think that something like this could actually happen who knows there is enough action but not so much to blur the plot and keep this film an adult sci fi film there is a lot of beautiful scenery the special effects are first rate and much more realistic then all those silly hobbit movies finally all of the actors did an excellent job and this is another very good performance from tom cruise regardless of the haters i think another reason this is a more intelligent sci fi movie is because this is partially made by a foreign movie company and not the bankrupt of ideas hollywood crowd i highly recommend this movie 
i picked up the latest science fiction epic oblivion sometimes i get a little worried buying a movie sight unseen but this time it certainly did not disappoint the movie stars tom cruise and morgan freeman and was directed by joseph kosinski and based on his graphic novel of the same name the movie is one of the apocalyptic films which displays the planet earth after it has been destroyed by aliens i have decided this will be a spoiler free review because i think this is a movie you really need to see for yourself and to see it unfold before you i will give a basic synopsis of the plot it is the year years after earth was invaded by aliens jack harper tom cruise and his partner victoria vika owen played by the beautiful andrea riseborough are the only ones on after the invasion and they are there to repair drones that are fighting off the residual alien resistance the surviving inhabitants of earth are living on titan one of the moons of saturn harper meets up with malcolm beech a resistance fighter played by the legendary morgan freeman one of my very favorite actors and he also begins to have flash backs to a time he was with a woman on the empire state building prior to the alien invasion things begin to unravel and we begin to see that appearances can be deceptive pros the cinematography and special effects are stellar this movie is great eye candy but you do not get an overdose of it the acting is great and two of my favorites cruise and freeman are in this film and do a fine job this is my first time seeing andrea riseborough and i enjoyed her performance she portrays a sense of vulnerability while also wanting to stay in denial concerning the things jack is discovering i do like the story some of the criticisms i have read that there are plot elements that we have seen in other movies while i can agree with that assessment i can also see that this is common in hollywood movies i am fine with movies that may have similar plot elements to other movies as long as it is executed well and that is the case with this movie i also enjoy the story the movie mixes romance mystery and action adventure into a tale that will keep the viewer engaged and caring about all the characters throughout despite great special effects this is a very character driven movie cons i really have only one minor complaint director kosinski wanted this movie to be an homage to the science fiction films of the s and in many way he succeeds in that endeavor the movie is paced more like a film from the s and it is slower than the more kinetic pacing we modern viewers and grown accustomed to is that a fault of the directors or is it a fault of the viewer i will place blame on myself we live in a fast paced mircowave society that wants instant gratification so it was hard to slow down and get absorbed into the story i just wasnt used to it so really this is not a con it is just something that the viewer needs to be aware of when going in to the movie it is an old fashioned movie and as i think more on the pacing it really does work even though some viewers might not be used to it this movie does have some good re watch capabilities for me as a mystery there are clues throughout the movie and on more than one viewing you can pick up on these clues in an era where science fiction films are heavy with cgi and are like cotton candy for the mind this one is not it will make you think and keep you on your toes 
loved the story acting twists and ending constantly keeps shifting and never boring cruise and freeman are just excellent a must see for guys or girls lots of mystery suspense action and thrills 
wow i wished i watched this movie in the theaters loved it you wont regret watching this movie enough said 
i didnt know anything about the movie in fact had never heard of it till it came up on amazon i saw it got pretty negative reviews on rotten tomato for example and i was hesitant to pay for a rental it starts with tom cruise speed reading the history of the world since the apocalypse then he goes off on some macho gun toting thing ugh i thought this is all so implausible and its all just a silly vehicle to show some dumb action well not so fast a bit into the film it turns out that this is a very interesting story indeed its exactly what i was hoping for cerebral philosophical intriguing and poetic and now seen in this new light the actions scenes were a fun bonus in addition the cinematography was beautiful hard to say much about the film without spoilers so ill leave it at that i dont get the bad reception it got ive watched just about every sci fi film ever made and this one was good stuff i guess youll just have to try it for yourself and see which camp youre in but it would be a shame to not even try it a bit of a warning before you pay amazons streaming had terrible sound i had to watch it on my ipad because thats the only way i could get subtitles just an fyi that aside i really enjoyed it 
generally speaking my favorite films are the ones that are pretty much genre diverse yet if i do break down into genres my favorite is science fiction that is the reason for the five star ranking of oblivion as it is simply the purest form of sci fi put to film for a basic plot summary this movie sees the team of jack tom cruise and victoria andrea riseborough monitoring the water removal from earth after the planet has been decimated by attack we used the nukes says jack in an opening montage on one away mission however jack is blind side by beech morgan freeman the leader of a gang of rogues that changes everything that jack has ever believed in or thought he believed in plot wise this is science fiction at its finest it is part other worldly part cautionary tale part human drama and all adventure throughout for those who have watched a lot of sci fi all the basic landmarks of such stories are touched upon it doesnt get old or feel re hashed though as director joseph kosinski makes sure to keep the proceedings on track and moving forward the visuals of oblivion are also spectacular youll feel as if you truly are in the future via the use of interesting integrated new technologies this isnt one of those all visuals movies by no means but it would be more accurate to say that the visuals perfectly complement the storylines and characters overall sci fi fans will love oblivion for its ability to make the mind wonder it might not be the flick for everyone but if it looks even at all intriguing to you its a pretty good bet youll at least find it somewhat enjoyable if not much more so 
i saw this movie on the big screen loved it then i saw in darkness then i wished i was back to see toms movie oblivion the real thing i will buy this movie when its in d 
from the artwork and trailer i did not see how i would like the movie once i started watching the movie i loved the voice acting the beautiful art and graphics the story is very touching once it reaches the point of no return it is a very enjoyable movie for the whole family and just loners dont know what steve jobs had to do with this movie or why it was dedicated to him but never the less i am curious last thing to say is that it is a very a very good movie 
pixar and disney never cease to amaze me with their artistry enchantment and the way they see things outside the box this too will be a timeless classic with all the other pixar disney films this was the perfect mother daughter film of a young lady who wants to be her own person not what her mother wanted her to be we all want our children to be educated smart good etc but if they want to be an archer or whatever let them be excellent movie i recommend it to everyone 
pixar has done it again and again and again i love pixar films and this one was no exception this is a great family film with an amazing story to it as well i love meridas spirit and long flowing locks of red hair the triplets are absolutely adorable and their personality and mischievousness comes out even when they are bears as a daughter it was great to watch with my mom we went to see it together while on vacation in fl awww and it was a perfect choice also this came with the pixar short la luna which is now one of my favorites it is so good i love that it came with the blu ray and dvd i kept the blu ray and gave the dvd to my mom thank you pixar keep them coming 
delightful film for all ages its funny theres mystery an adventure from start to finish so glad thus is now a dvd 
my six year old son and i saw this movie together and we both loved it this is an amazing story especially for a mother and her children he is very adverse to anything that might be girly and merida is such a tomboy that he didnt even think of it as to girly for him at all i already have this movie preordered and am counting down the days until it ships 
saw this with my husband when it came out in the theaters we both loved it received it for christmas and we both loved it just as much the second time as the first the art is amazing animations have really come a long way since i was a child the story line is wonderful a bit of faerie tale a growing up tale a lesson in listening and in following your heart no mater if you are a girl or boy you can be whatever you have a mind to be the humor is wonderful i cant recommend this movie too much it is a must see 
set to be a classic a must see for every age great story lesson and the music is wonderful youll want the soundtrack 
brave was an excellent movie and i am very pleased with it the picture quality was great and the story line was awesome 
absolutely loved every aspect of this movie favorite kid movie yet highly recommend this movie to any age my month old year old watches it all the time 
i absolutely love this movie i love the music the story and all the characters this is one of my sons favorite disney movies too i think its one of the best new disney princesses yet 
one of pixars best i love everything about this movie especially since the characters are ancient celts and that era has to be my favorite time period maybe im partial to the landscape and time but there is something about the charm of the characters and the breathtaking shots that make this movie a must have for anyone even if they dont have kids 
its a great movie for mother and daughter to watch it shows how a mother and daughter trying to reconnect over a awful incident that the daughter had caused because she did not want to have an arranged marriage 
i found this animated film from pixar to be delightfully entertaining i would not have any reservations letting my children see this movie inspite of its modern profeminist point of view depicted in the movie our young heroine shows courage and strength as well as beauty and charm and her message voiced by i think women everywhere the film is fun to watch and very entertaining and i would buy it again 
good movie not as much as the hype surrounding it but its a good family movie with a good story line where characters who dont understand each other mother and daughter come to a better understanding of each other and a good relationship 
i do not know why this story has gotten so many bad reviews for one i have to say the scary scenes are not so scary both of my girls must just be brave and strong young girls because both of them dont seem to be bothered by the movie now we did purchase the book a while ago and have read the story to them a number of times and discussed the scary scenes we also sat down as a family made popcorn and watched it all together with our yr old and almost yr old i have to say there are some parts that i was not a fan of for instance how she visits a witch to change her mother and that the food was left around for her brothers to eat but the hype about the nudity and every thing else what are we puritans my girls didnt even seem to notice that the boys were naked i thought i was a wonderful story about how some traditions should be changed and left behind like marrying your daughters off at a young age making them wear outdated clothing and arranging their marriages hence the break from tradition which all the young men were happy about as well it was refreshing to have a movie that showed how a girl could be strong and not have to live happily ever after and marry prince charming or be saved by a man it showed how she must figure out how to make things right through problem solving my husband and i believe our two daughters need to learn to rely on themselves and someday as i did find a wonderful man to share their lives we do not believe that our girls need a man to be complete nor should a man need a woman they should be healthy independent persons who are not co dependent i thought it was a delightful show that let you see how both mother and daughter were not listening to one another and after mom gets changed into a bear they spend time mending and bonding together i have to say parents sometimes get very hung up in having to have things their way and do not listen to their children i am also guilty at times no one is perfect i liked how the bonds were mended both concretely for young children with the tapestry verbally and physically for older children and parents both the mother and merida matured while working together to mend their relationship and change mom back into a human 
i loved the characters and plot my wife says its the best shes seen in years rent this one and love it too 
loved this movie it was so funny it is not your typical disney princess movie such a great role model for young girls 
our heroine is so enduring i kept wanting to hand her a hair brush and tell her that she would make any mother proud 
seriously this is one of my favorite movies to come out recently i had to go see it twice in theaters though im not one to normally go to the same movie twice a wonderful twist on a disney princess who doesnt want to get married 
i rented this the day it came out on dvd boy am i glad i rented this movie i love this kind of animation to begin with so this movie was on the top of my to watch list when it came out i didnt know a whole lot about this movie but i knew that it was a family film with great characters and and amazing story line but i had no idea it could make me cry and want to call my mother this is such a great movie that i give it five stars and trust me when i say thats not very often that i give a movie five stars i am definitely going to add this to my collection and re watch it over and over again watch this so good 
the kids will be spellbound and the adults will find themselves drawn in too a great way to connect with your kids while finding yourself thoroughly entertained too 
my daughter is going to be so excited to open this on christmas morning we saw it in the theater and thought it was great were glad to have a copy at home 
this is an entertaining movie for young and old the story was cute and the three little bears were adorable 
the story of merida is very amazing love it fantasy looks so real i enjoyed it very much and wish that they come out with another adventure of this irish pricess princess
a fantastic movie with a wonderful message about being yourself and sticking up for what you believe in i spent the extra money to support the package that came with a true digital copy no ultraviolet here and i supported it with my hard earned dollars 
i like this movie my grand kids really liked it too very cute and funny thanks so much for this
i have loved disney movies since i was little my boys are the same way this is the most recent disney movie and we got it on sale during black friday its a great movie at a great price 
if you havent seen brave already you have to see this it an excellent movie very entertaining the kids or adults will love it
good story and excellent animation i watched ii twice a different twist on an old fairy tale i found it to be most entertaining 
i found this animation refreshing pixar movies are the best a movie that the whole family can enjoy together get out the popcorn 
this is the best non musical disney film to date i especially like the way it depicts celtic culture clearly disney has finally learned something from its pocahontas and mulan cultural debacles merida is the perfect heroine but more importantly this film touches upon the most difficult relationship of all mothers and daughters its a film so universal to our experiences as girls and women that it is an absolute must see for mothers and daughters alike the soundtrack here is fabulous please download the album its absolutely beautiful music especially noble maiden fair which is sung by emma thompson in gaelic and features haunting irish harps 
what a lovely movie lots of laughs one liners running gags good music better charaters i wished i saw this at the theater buy this movie now and give as a present you will not be disappointed 
we really enjoyed watching this story about a strong scottish female as a female with scottish inheritence in my background i was doubly happy to see it 
i love that disney now has a princess that does not need a prince to be complete or to rule her kingdom yes 
it was sooooo excellent in showing the relationship between mother and daughter how as teens we want our way but choosing the wrong path can have consequences my grandchildren loved it 
this is a great movie for the whole family its very hard to take your eyes away from this one i would recommend this movie to friends and family 
bought this for kids to watch but we enjoied it as much as they did cute movie fun to watch great for all ages 
great moviegreat edition i love the special features and watching everything come alivei also love having the option of having it on my ipod and the dvd for in the car
great price and love this movie my children have a blast watching it its always a joy getting to watch movies that my babies can laugh and want to watch again 
we took our son to see this movie in the theaters and then bought it when it came out on video ive been a disney fan as a child and seen almost every animated movie they have made this is by far one of my favorites probably because the story isnt about happiness and finding true love but about happiness family and understanding merida is a character worth looking up to and we see both her and her mother grow in the span of the movie it was nice to finally see a story where the female character did the saving and was the hero of the day 
i loved brave from start to finish it is most likely my number one movie for the storyline is very good the scenes are breathtaking and the movie in a whole brings you into the story disney and pixar did a top notch job on this movie i still cannot get over how beautiful the animated scenes are brave had a great storyline to it and everything about it was very good my little sister who is loved brave but i think i actually liked it more great job disney the characters were all very good in the movie and the voices matched perfectly to the characters 
my wife and i decided to watch this one evening we were both greatly entertained i would recommend this to just about anyone 
well ok ill say a little more its refreshing when you get stories that are original or at least are not very common and ive never heard of this one before like all pixar movies its on screen beauty and production value are beyond expectations and it has a decent teaching moral to the story it really is a classic you can watch again and again 
i would give this an a rating my daughter grandson and i saw it at the theater and we were glad that it came out on dvd before christmas i would recommend purchase of this to anyone 
disney appears to be doing everything right when it comes to civil rights it has certainly been a long way their animated films reflect racial diversity without being patronizing or offensive with good values brave is an exciting and delightful film that follows this pattern addressing the at times neglected role of women in society showing an empowered and determined young lady that defies good ol boy traditions and it does it in an intelligent and colorful way the story takes place in scotland where king fergus rules the clan dunbroch the king gives merida his young daughter a bow for her birthday with time merida becomes an expert archer a beautiful teenager and lives a happy life with her three identical triplets it is at this time that her mother queen elinor tells her that she is to be engaged for marriage to one of the sons of the leaders of his fathers allied clan kings merida who has a strong and determined character independent and opinionated hates the idea and does everything that she can to avoid this task which means breaking a holy tradition in doing so she hurts her mother by asking a witch to transform her into a bear merida of course feels sorry that she made that choice and against time tries to reverse the spell add to this the curse of the legendary mordu a huge mean black bear who is feared by all and who was once a handsome prince all these problems will make merida reexamine her actions and behavior and her future in the kingdom brave has all the technical goodies of any pixar films and it is just great to watch it is also funny wicked and charming and as i said it is about womens empowerment and bravery the blu ray blu ray d dvd and digital copy edition is loaded with extras such as extended scenes pixar shorts alternate opening art galleries audio commentaries and much more usa color min plus additional materials reviewed on december by eric gonzalez for disney blu ray 
i loved the annimation particularly of meridas brilliant red mop merida is a great role model for little girls and you dont see that often enough i am amazed that this movie went over so well in scotland as the scots in the movie are steriotyped and poked fun at but i loved it the sets and scenery were well done as well we saw it twice and once again in french its just a fun movie 
love the story it was suprised by the story didnt expect it i have watched it several times and will more 
we saw this in the theatre and absolutely loved it it was a movie both my son and daughter enjoyed lots of great humor and action all of the characters were wonderfully created i highly recommend it for your movie library 
i loved this movie and im one can never be too old for cartoons and animated movies in fact i think theyre awesome 
i like the movie it had alot of celtic lore in the movie which is something i liked but it was entertaining had me laughing nearly all the way through 
amazing graphics good plot and on top of all that you go girl attitude as well we need more movies like this 
this is a great movie i recommend it for the whole family the underlining message is ever so applicable to all those with children my familiy and i really enjoyed it 
on a spur of the moment decision we took the kids to see brave i have to admit that i was probably more excited to see this film than some of the kids my oldest son almost backed out to stay home and do chores instead what a choice huh the trailer had me a little nervous as it didnt feel the same as some of the other pixar movies ive loved it almost had a dreamworks studio feel which isnt a bad thing since ive enjoyed some dreamworks movies but i was worried that it wouldnt be all that i hoped for and expected so even though the trailer didnt put forth a whole lot in terms of the overall plot i went into this film with pretty high expectations just because its from pixar and hands down my expectations were met if anybody else loves pixar and was worried as i was that this film was a departure from their usual magic put those fears aside this movie is great before talking about the movie i want to comment on the short before the film as with all pixar movies and more and more on other animated films as well they had a short cartoon this one was called la luna it starts with a young boy sitting in the middle of the water with two older men there are no words but a lot of mumbled grunts and other unspoken language as the title suggests the short involves the moon through most of the short it felt like we were balancing between a lovely piece of artwork and silly humor that tried to stop just short of the slapstick humor of cartoon but then in the final moments of the short there is a great image that pulls everything together in a surprising way that is absolutely fantastic and makes the whole thing very endearing and special this one is a sweet and fun showcase of talent similar to the surprising twist in the short there was a surprise for me in the movie itself from the trailer it looked like the plot would be about an outspoken girl who doesnt want to get married because she has too much fun being a warrior boy shes at odds with her parents mostly her mother and sets out in search of a way to change things thats where the trailer left it and it left me thinking this might be a mulan esque story where she goes off on some sort of adventure again making me nervous that maybe wed just have a rehashed story the trailer is a bit sneaky i havent looked to see if theyve released a new more revealing trailer but i can tell you that the original trailers were somewhat misleading in terms of the overall plot and story arc of this movie with a couple of brief disjointed exceptions i think all of the scenes from the trailer come only from the first half or less of the movie about one third or one half of the way through the movie there is a big twisty plot element that makes this movie very different from what i expected i wont spoil it for you since the surprise is a lot of fun and it makes for a very compelling second half of the movie i dont think the movie would be any less enjoyable if you know whats going to happen but the thrill of the reveal is a lot of fun so ill leave you to it the story is not fresh and unique in fact it borrows themes and elements from other stories but it is told in a fresh humorous and compelling way the writing and directing is fabulous and keeps the pacing and fun it was filled with great banter as well as some awesome non verbal communication meridas little brothers never really speak and yet they are super evocative and funny other characters later in the movie also have super non verbal communication near the very end of the movie the staging of the scene was powerful enough that i looked next to me as lynette gasped in fear and whispered oh no and looked like she might cry even knowing this was a childrens film there was enough tension and emotion invoked that she was worried things might all fall apart the artwork is superb as is expected from pixar some of the scenery and landscape shots were absolutely stunning and looked almost photo realistic there was a scene where merida and her mother were walking through the forest and at quick glance it looked almost like a live action movie rather than a cartoon still the colors and palette were vibrant and cartoony enough to maintain the animation aspect but i was very impressed with the art the grass the water the hair the cloth great work the music was also great the score is wonderfully engrossing and a lot of fun they presented a wonderfully celtic vibe and had some great vocal selections as well all background there arent any musical numbers in the movie over the years i have absolutely loved the pixar films ive been a big disney fan since i was a little kid and enjoy those movies but i have to admit that some of the disney animated films of the past decade s have lost some of their charm and magic amid the slight slump from disney i feel like pixar has picked up the slack there are certainly pixar films i like more than others and i havent seen all of them the only full length film i havent seen is ratatouille but i really like all of their work and totally love many of them as i mentioned i was initially nervous that this film might be a departure from the pixar magic that i know and love my fears were unfounded and brave was as fabulous an experience as i have come to expect and enjoy from pixar there are a couple of scenes that might be a little intense for very young viewers and there was a scene where you see bare male bottoms as my wife pointed out to the kids it shows verisimilitude in the fact that there often wasnt anything worn beneath the kilts not that it was necessary to put it into the movie but it was some generally tasteful comic relief overall i really had a ton of fun with this movie and look forward to seeing it again all of the family really enjoyed it even my oldest who initially didnt plan on coming if youre on the fence but have enjoyed pixar in the past im pretty sure you wont be disappointed if youre not a fan of cartoons and kids movies this one might just straddle the fence enough between childish and grown up to help you have fun out of stars
we all loved this movie i loved how it was of irish tradition a little outside of the classic and i loved how head strong the princess was my son watched it times in the hrs we had rented it 
this one was very very funny and so delightful for the whole family to enjoy with a huge bowl of popcorn on a wintery evening we will enjoy this one as well for many years to come 
great plot with pixars over the top animation audio dolby digital true hd sounds incredible something to watch for the whole family 
this is a fabulous movie happy i bought it 
watched it several times it is exciting and very different than other kids moves it was not as predictible as the most comon kids movies 
very good movie i usually dont like cartoons or pixar but this one i loved great story line about a mother and daughter nice break away from the usual father son 
another awesome pixar movie and a must have addition to any respectable collection for movie loving father go on just buy it best deal i could find and when combined with prime shipping were a simple no brainer after all if you arent satisfied returns are a breeze thankfully i have rarely had to exercise that choice but when i have it has been painless how to regular stores stay ni business these days when i can sit here and order what i want have it in my hands days later no brainer 
ive been trying to understand why some seem to be lukewarm about brave some would like to see the beginning cut so that the action starts sooner i would say that youd miss the exposition if it wasnt there i for one enjoyed every minute of it some have said that the backgrounds were too realistic i think the backgrounds and all the animation is just incredibly beautiful i would agree with the sentiment that it would have been nice to see more of the mother daughter interaction but then the movie would have been too long for the younger kids its there appropriately but when the mother and daughters relationship changes it could have been a slower process and id have enjoyed it because im at an age where i can enjoy the subtle changes a ten year old wouldnt like that so i can understand the choice ive read all the negative reviews but i just dont agree brave is a great film as for this disc ultimate collectors edition its fine i would have liked a sound remix for the channel dolby the dialogue is slightly too weak or the musical soundtrack too loud but if you arent listening to the film on internal tv speakers then youre fine its all great and nothing too terribly distracting its great that disney included so many extras that makes buying these versions worth the extra i couldnt care less about the d but its there if i care to watch it but i honestly never do 
brave is a wonderful story from the previews and hype i expected it to be good and was surprised that it was actually better than all that brave is a genuinely nice fun movie that i enjoyed a lot the story is pretty similar to most fairy tales im sure this is based on a scottish fable what warmed my heart was merida the red haired girl she was strong and didnt want to follow stereotypes the animation was wonderful after a while i forgot this was animated the voices are all done beautifully overall this is just one darn good fun movie a strong young female character is a bonus 
as pixars first fairy tale and its first princess movie i was very curious to see what theyd come up with would braves merida be a traditional princess in the disney mold or a more modern girl well its the latter thankfully merida is a great character and role model for girls and boys really who are struggling between respecting their parents and growing into their own person this isnt at all a story about a girl who a needs rescuing or b falls helplessly in love if anything its a love story about the complicated relationship between mothers and daughters its also about duty versus personal freedom merida is the kind of girl who doesnt wait around to be rescued when the situation warrants she rescues herself good for pixar a great movie 
disney pixar really hit the mark on this one the main character shares a lot more true to life qualities with growing up that many past princess characters shes rebellious to the point of not only going against her mothers wishes but trying to subvert them completely but she loves her family dearly all the same and the bond runs deep through all that happens seeing a childs deep love and caring towards a parent whose rules they also so desperately wish to escape from is a very different motif for a disney princess story i found it heartwarming on so many different levels the fear the bravery the sacrifices and the strengthening of their loving bond through their tribulations are all wonderful and relatable parts of the story for any parent and their growing or grown child the lesson of mutual respect between a parent and child is a wonderful reminder of this constant challenge to both real life counterparts as they watch this movie as well as others have stated this movie does have some fairly scary scenes involving animals many people use the term intense which they are but to be perfectly blunt theyre scary as a small child i would have had bad dreams involving them but i also clung to imagery in movies very tightly and had an overactive imagination if in doubt watch the movie by yourself first or search online for a synopsis or video of just the scary scenes if you dont want to spoil getting to watch the whole movie together for the first time with your child its not nightmare on elm street or anything its just good to be aware of the scenes if you have a child you know gets frightened easily as for the physical disc itself the presentation is very nice i like the lenticular slip cover that goes over the disc case though it is prone to the corners getting a little bent after removing and reinserting the blu ray case a few times as its a pretty tight fit i do appreciate that unlike a lot of multi disc sets the discs arent stacked on top of each other in this package each one is one its own little spindle so you can get to whichever disc you want without having to remove a bunch of others first the bonus features are also really enjoyable and this movie looks great in d a wonderful package to buy if youd like to get the complete set of viewing options we used the d blu ray as a special movie night treat the standard blu ray for normal lets pop in a movie type viewing and the dvd for playing in the car during road trips 
good story well told with good characters great voice work and something for both kids and adults it was enjoyable didnt drag and had a good message for kids which is all you can ask for in a family movie and parents will recognize the issues both they and their kids face as they grow cant ask for more complete family viewing 
i grew up watching disney movies and almost all of them have the mother absent so this was a treat the mother and daughter are strong roll models and visually the movie is stunning the extra footage included in this edition was also enjoyable great experience with the delivery in two days so overall this was a solid five star experience 
i was expecting a downer because my girls had seen the movie first it was laughter watch it again and again thanks
this movie was great always wanted to see it and amazon makes it perfect to view content especially on multiple platforms 
i loved it i added it to my christmas list it is a great family movie all kids and adults would like
wonderful story line great characters great movie for mothers and daughters to see together at the end i even cried a little bit my family and i really got caught up in the story cant wait to get the blu ray and see it again 
in the summer of pixar animation studios released their latest computer animated film titled brave the summer blockbuster was written by award winning writer brenda chapman chicken run who framed roger rabbit the real ghostbusters mark andrews john carter spider man steve purcell creator of the adventure game series sam max and irene mecchi the lion king hercules the hunchback of notre dame and co directed by mark andrews brenda chapman and steve purcell the film would become pixars first fairy tale film and also feature a darker tone compared to previous pixar animated films and as one would expected from a pixar film brave which was budgeted around million went on to earn over million in the box office video brave ultimate collectors edition is probably one of the most significant disney pixar animated releases i have seen in terms of overall presentation and gorgeous picture quality the film is presented in p high definition aspect ratio and as far as picture quality is concerned everything about this film looks incredibly well detailed first lets take a look at the blu ray d version for those who have the hardware to display d this is one film that was created with d in mind from the way the animation utilizes depth for d is wonderful to see you actually can see the scale of the castle through d as it gives an impression the location is quite vast while there are scenes with the elinor as the bear or mordu the demon bear cowering over a character with great monstrosity you can see the scale of the bears but for the most part the d for this film is improved compared to past disney d films overall depth gives us a sense of scale much more effective for the film on blu ray d as for the blu ray release the blu ray of brave is fantastic from the food that king fergus is eating to the emphasis on hair from the strands of hair unkept hair beard hair ear hair you name it there is a lot of detail when it comes to hair and hair physics in this film also the clothing are well detailed the background scenery looks magnificent outdoors especially indoors the overall color is sharp vibrant and black levels are nice and deep there are so many things about this film that looks realistic and detailed i was really impressed the overall picture quality is one of the best i have seen on blu ray and the film on blu ray looks amazing as for the dvd the dvd version is presented in enhanced for televisions audio subtitles if you thought that brave ultimate collectors edition was great for videophiles audiophiles will also find a lot of satisfaction with the blu ray release presented in dolby truehd this is one of the most immersive disney blu ray releases i have heard for an animated film from the environmental ambiance of hearing the forest the wind the trees the grass being fully integrated to the film and giving you the sense that merida and family are out in the country there is also great utilization of sound when mordu approaches or when ilinor growls in bear form there is also great utilization of sound when merida is shooting her bow and arrow or when the men are fighting against the demon bear the immersive soundtrack utilizes the surround channels may it be with sound effects or its beautiful musical soundtrack but also a good amount of lfe to make you feel those action scenes but the positive factor of this film is its immersiveness and making you feel that sound outdoors are coming from all over your soundscape brave sounds absolutely fantastic in blu ray as for subtitles subtitles are presented in english sdh english commentary dolby digital spanishspecial features brave ultimate collectors edition comes with the following special features la luna a theatrical short about a young boy working with his father and grandfather the legend of mordu what is the history about the demon bear known as mordu behind the scenes featuring seven scenes in which the crew traveled to scotland and embraced the scenery which was important for creating the look and feel of brave once upon a time each scene may have had different perspectives and storytelling that had to be cut out this segment features the different ideas for a certain scene extended scenes featuring four separate extended scenes with extra scenes that were cut out of the final cut directors commentary featuring audio commentary by director mark andrews co director steve purcell story supervisor brian larsen and editor nick smith fergus mordu an alternate opening featuring a scene that original focused on king fergus fallen warriors shots that were cut out of the final version of the film and honored in this blu ray dirty hairy people the animators talk about how the characters have a lot of hair in this animated film as well as trying to capture the authenticity of scottish people of that time period including bad teeth it is english sort of the scottish talent and crew discuss the various scottish dialects utilized in the film and with various characters angus a feature about the research of horses and capturing the look and feel of the horse and also creating the relationship between merida and her horse angus the tapestry creating the visual element of the tapestry and its importance int he film art galleries with your remote you can view art revolving around the characters color keys development art environments and graphics extras brave ultimate collectors edition comes with a cardboard sleeve case with a renticular front featuring merida the ultimate collectors edition comes with the blu ray d blu ray dvd and digital copy judgment call brave was a pleasant surprise to come from pixar not only was the storyline a bit dark but rarely do you find a story that is concentrated on a mother and daughter relationship but obviously it was a film that was used to test waters of what pixar can accomplish outside of animated films that featured non human characters especially characters who were not young children and it was also a film that featured pixar animation studios first female director while a film like up was a film about an elderly mans life who is changed thanks to a child brave is a film that was driven by co director and co writer brenda chapman and capturing the relationship between mother and daughter from chapmans experience of traveling to scotland and wanting to create a fairy tale in the tradition of hans christian andersen and the brothers grimm im always open for something unique and different and what i enjoyed about this film is its overall feel and how the film incorporated scottish dialects and utilizing the right talent that fit the film originally reese witherspoon was to voice the character of merida but it worked to pixars benefit to have actress kelly macdonald play the lead character from the spoken dialogue to seeing a female character that is athletic dominant but also free spirited you just dont see this kind of character in a disney animated film and speaking of acting along with actress kelly macdonald brave also features wonderful voice acting from bill connolly emma thompson julie walters robbie coltrane kevin mckidd and craig ferguson the voice acting really made a big difference in the believability of this film and its important to mention that brave is not a film that loses its cuteness in sake of creating something realistic while the film does focus on mother and daughter relationships children will no doubt love the adorable and mischievous nature of meridas triplet young brothers and also for action purposes you have meridas father ready to jump into any fray to defend his family and people the characters are fun the scenery looks absolutely beautiful and overall animation is fantastic but will it work for children i think children will love it for its action i also feel that families will enjoy it for that family bonding storyline but also the nature of the story and the aspect of family and for those who have wanted an animated film with a brave heroine brave is that kind of movie as for the blu ray release brave ultimate collectors edition is wonderful not only is this the best d animated film to come from disney thus far its also a film that looks and sounds incredible on blu ray there is so much detail in the characters especially the hair clothing backgrounds and scenery i was impressed by seeing how fantastic brave looks on blu ray it really was breathtaking just to watch this film and see how pixar continues to improve after one hit film after the other as for special features you get a lot of them included with this release that shows us how much work and research went into capturing scottish culture and integrating it through the entire film and with the holiday season coming up brave ultimate collectors edition is also fantastic as you get the blu ray d blu ray dvd and digital copy a first for pixar first female director the first fairy tale film and a film that focuses on a mother and daughter relationship but brave is much more than that its a film that is strong on storytelling featuring wonderful acting but also brave is one of the most impressive blu ray releases i have ever seen and heard in my years of reviewing blu ray releases brave ultimate collectors edition is a must own must buy blu ray release and is highly recommended and deserving of five stars 
i bought this movie for a friend and her family and even though we didnt get to watch it personally her and her four children loved it 
it ended up being different from what i thought it would be which is great i love to be surprised by movies 
another one i think im going to have to buy it was a darling story set in a gorgeous backdrop 
this movie was so much fun to watch a reminder of how important relationships are humor for everyone here not just for kids 
the entire movie was a joy to watch my granddaughters saw the lesson to be learned by the consequences of ones actions a very good way to teach children to stop and think before doing anything in anger the graphics were also great dotty stocky
i dont enjoy every box office hit animated movie but i thoroughly enjoyedbrave the ending theme may be about bravery but the story is rich in family relationship and in choosing who you are who you want to be and how you treat others its a great movie to take your kids to see with you 
walt disneys new pixar animation film brave has a lot going for it astonishingly life like animation a plucky heroine an enchanting setting in the scottish highlands and a fast moving and engaging story equal parts comedy drama and supernatural coming of age tale parts of the movie are violent and or extremely intense this movie may be frightening to really young children merida is a princess the eldest child of king fergus ruler of an ancient kingdom set somewhere in the highlands of ancient scotland the introduction shows her to be an independent tom boy with wonderful red hair a love for the outdoors and archery and the angst and stubborn streak of a typical teenager a precursor sequence tells of a dramatic family encounter with a vicious bear that lays the groundwork for key parts of the rest of the plot as the story proper gets underway we learn the time has come for her to be betrothed to the eldest son of one of the clans of the kingdom a crucial event of state for which meridas mother the dutiful queen elinor has been attempting to prepare her for years merida refuses to play out her role subverting the betrothal process and fleeing into the forests there she has an encounter with a witch who offers her a magical way out of her responsibilities as a princess this escape comes with unfortunate and even terrifying consequences for meridas mother and for the kingdom that merida will only slowly come to recognize she will be forced to race the clock attempting to apply her mothers lessons to putting things right brave has a nice mixture of action and comedy even in its supernatural elements the action builds to a dramatic and emotional climax at storys end assisted by a score highlighting both gaelic and modern music its final message explicitly stresses meridas right to find her own destiny while suggesting that she must also take responsibility for the consequences and for her obligations as a princess to the kingdom brave is highly recommended as excellent entertainment 
ever since we seen the movie in theaters my children have been wanting this movie i purchased it during the promotional period glad i waited great price excellent movie
i watched this movie and i recommend to everyone and anyone that is looking for encouragement to watch this great watch 
i love that the girl doesnt have to be a perfect little princess in this my year old is somewhat of a tomboy so it was nice to have a princess that was more like her i usually dont like animated movies but i did enjoy this one with my daughter 
a fabulous film a story of an independent girl a princess in gaelic times whose mother is driven that she should be a real lady and heir when the queen finally arranges her betrothal the girl becomes desperate and distraught stumbles upon a witchs cabin and gets a spell to make her mother more agreeable but the magic makes her more bearable tying to an ancient legend can merida the princess rescue her mother siblings and along the way find herself its disney what do you think lol as silly as it may seem to some readers there is something i feel i need to point out theres some animated nudity which surprised m but did not shock or offend me with nudity of any kind but it is something you dont commonly see in a disney film nor expect to see so i thought i should add that its in this film the film includes two bonus feature film shorts and commentary it is subtitled in english for the deaf 
i gave this five stars because this showed up on time very professional i would recommend this to everyone to watch 
my family tries to only get movies that includes digital copies because its so convenient to transfer to our ipad and iphones its also the best for those long drives with small kids 
i wanted to go see this movie when it first came out but for one reason or another i never got to see it until i purchased it in amazon i loved it
especially in disney ironic they own pixar now there are so few movie that will empower young girls no role models that is to say none that dont get saved by men within the movie mulan was the closest perhaps but think about it in must female lead animated movies even the heroine gets rescued or saved by a man why not give the girls a real role model merida spelling comes really really close not the best pixar effort but the subject content is good and our girls love it that along make it worth it 
our family loves brave amazing idea great animation tons of humor as well as some touching moments great job disney 
this is a great movie that bids well on a projection screen great sound image quality is top notch i highly recommend this movie for the family 
first off the animation quality in this movie is absolutely beautiful just watching how meridas the main female character long curly red hair moves in a wonder in and of itself animation is just getting better and better as are the plots for many animation movies i didnt see this movie in the theatre a decision which i now regret but i sat down to watch it based on the idea of a main female protagonist and with a love of all things scottish i was not disappointed the humor was great if crude at times and the scots characters covered a spectrum as displayed by the different virtues and vices of each clan merida is a princess and is expected to wed one of the three sons of the other three clans her own father is head of the fourth clan and she discovers a clause so that she can fight for her own hand and takes part in the contests of course she is a wild girl who can ride hunt and shoot with the best and resents her much more dignified and formal mothers attempts to make a real lady out of her she resists what she sees as her fate and so discovers that the question about princess vs rebel was never so far apart as she first thought this is a real mother daughter picture one that brings the two together as they fight to overcome the results of a badly chosen spell in between the funny scenes we see how they each learn to really see each other rather than their expectations of each other the movie has many elements especially how people speak woven into the somewhat more historical ones so it will appeal to a modern audience fortunately it isnt too distracting there is enough action that most kids wont get too bored but i would recommend this movie more for year olds and up than any younger ones highly recommended for young teen girls the reasons for which will be obvious if you watch the movie not my absolute favorite animated movie but right up there 
this is a great story that was done with animation that is at the top this movie is great for kids and adults 
great story line good character cohesion thoughtful and endearing movie i would recommend this to anyone young or old yippee 
the colors were beautiful and there was a lot of action that kept the show very interesting and fun for all ages 
a delightful brilliant and charming film pixar has created an amazing story that grabs the attention of children immediately and keeps them entertained throughout the characters are stunning as they give a breathtaking performance and will have the young ones laughing out loud wonderful unforgettable animation with a creative story as the film portrays the trials and tribulations of stepping into adulthood not an easy task for most a fun filled adventure enjoyable for the entire family highly recommended 
love love love this movie it seems to bring out the child in me one of the best animated movies i have watched 
this is a great story the colors and animation is unbelievable everyone should watch this movie i believed that there would be some killing in the cartoon but i was glad to be disappointed great movie you must watch 
great wonderful we really enjoyed it very much the movie was for our grandchild and we msaw it all together thank you gliglu live com
very good movie and the animation was exceptional the whole family will enjoy this story along with a be careful what you wish for lesson i think the d was very good not really pop out at you good but very good none the less i am having a problem with the digital copy included but that is a disney issue i have not been able to properly open it for sharing on my other devices i have never done this before so i may have opened it wrong 
my year old niece wants to watch brave every time she comes over and im happy to oblige her because i enjoy it as much as she does 
i saw this movie in the theater and i just have to have it in my collection i can watch this again and again and again 
brave was an amazing film the detailing in the animation was beautiful and the story line was touching im not usually a cryer but this movie got to me it was filled with memorable anecdotes sarcasm and actual historical data of course the story line wasnt realistic i wont spoil what it was but its a cartoon people finding nemo wasnt based on a true story either you know as far as scary goes its not that bad hunchback of notre dame is x creeper than brave people need to stop complaining overall pixar outdid themselves once again definite recommend 
i was very entertained very cheered up by this movie there was comedy tragedy coming of age a well rounded movie for the young adults out there i give this movie a high rating because for an animated film it was very down to earth and pulls you into the script without you realizing it is happening disney will be around forever with this quality of work kudos to the new managing team 
i am the mother of two daughters and had a mother myself so i understand this movie completely it is not always easy to do what is expected of you by a mother who wants only the best for her daughter it is not easy to have a different idea of where you want your life to go than your mother so this is about a girl who is struggling to be herself and find out who she is and who makes some mistakes and hurts those she loves she realizes in the end how much she loves her mother and how much her mother loves her i thought the graphics were beautiful i thought merida was a saucy and fun heroine i loved that she didnt just marry someone in the end 
i loved loved loved this movie ostensibly the tale of a rebellious princess the underlying messages of love family self esteem and especially mother daughter relations are not just for children everyone can benefit from the thoughts behind one of the best animated movies ive ever seen the young princesss hair is so real you can touch it and that kind of detail is in every single frame and i wonder if the animators had actors in mind when they drew the characters so fine is the fit of appearance and voice kelly macdonald as merida and billy connolly as king fergus are incomparable if you have children especially girls you owe it to them to buy this movie and if you dont have children you owe it to yourself to buy this movie 
i love the fact that pixar has finally made a princess movie i have always loved pixar i remember when toy story caom out and was very excited to learn about this one i love the fact that is about a young lady standing up for herself and doing what she thinks is right also it veers away from the typical princess movie in the way that it does not involve any kind of romance for the heroine it is different and that is what i love about it 
best princess movie ever my whole family loved this movie and it was surprisingly funny and cute the characters are brilliant 
i bought this video for my grand daughter and she loves it when she visits she wants to watch it 
this movie is not only entertaining but it also showed something very important it showed how important it is to listen to our kids and how pride can sometimes hurt our relationships or misguide us into thinking were always right as parents my husband and i both truly enjoyed this movie 
i watched this movie with my kids last night and it was the best childrens movie i have seen in recent years the plot is wonderful the voices are so perfectly scottish and the animation is so amazing i know i have to watch it again to pick up on all the things i missed the first time the story this movie tells is so unique and refreshing there is a lesson in this movie but it is delivered in a gentle way that kids will both understand and appreciate the movie also has a lot of humor and some total snort you laugh so hard moments that even parents will get a kick out of i just cant get over how well this movie was made it is incredible if i had to nominate a movie as the parents choice of the year this would be it for sure 
this movie was really good with a good message about making decisions as well as opening your eyes to no traditional standard 
i love this movie and the short la luna is amazing the d case is nice quality i would buy again 
finally a beautiful story about a young girl that isnt all about falling in love and getting a man i mean really we need to stop teaching our daughters this and brave begins with this independent sassy girl who hates being prim and proper would much rather be a tomboy and shoot arrows and ride her horse shes still a girl and just not ready to grow up she reminds me so much of my daughter ella spoilers alert ahead scroll to bottom to avoid so when her parents announce she will be married off to keep the peace between the kingdoms she is beyond unhappy merida doesnt want to be a princess let alone a wife her mother just wont listen and her mother the queen thinks merida just wont listen either as peace is at stake if she doesnt comply neither understands the other when the suitors arrive her parents announce only the firstborn from each royal family may shoot for meridas hand in marriage which gives merida a great idea being the excellent marksman or girl that she is she announces after everyone has gone and shot poorly that she will be shooting for her own hand this is one of my favorite scenes as she really defies her mother here publicly while rejecting all her suitors and standing up for herself and what she wants of course her and mom get into a major fight in which the queen tosses meridas precious bow into the fireplace breaking her daughters heart and sending merida running from her home on horseback in tears soon she discovers a witch whom she begs for the power just to change her mother merida hopes this will change her mind about the whole marriage and be done with things can go back to normal the witch gives her a tart to feed the queen promising her mom will change what merida doesnt expect is that her mom changes into a bear the very animal her father hates the most for taking his leg the witch promised her a change but her mom changes physically not internally like merida expected fearing the king wont understand or believe his wife is a bear and may try to kill her merida and her mother flee the kingdom they of course return to the witches hut to no avail she simply left a message about fixing what has come undone by the next day or permanently becoming a bear but the witch herself is gone frustrated guilty and sad merida tries to care for her mother and apologizes as they make do im the wild it is entertaining to watch as the prim and proper queen turned bear tries to keep her manners about her while in her new form she makes eating utensils from branches just to have them fling about she tries to slowly eat fish at first making merida cook it before impatience kicks in and it isnt long before she is ravishing fish cold and alive with get bear claws the two begin to share and form a new bond as her mother lives as a bear in the wild with merida doing things and learning things from her daughter merida in contrast learns more about the different kingdoms and their fall as they stumble upon another bear this one once human also cursed like her mother a part of what she thought was just a fairytale proved to be true merida finally sees the importance of all the kingdoms uniting and her role in it when she realizes how they came apart with this one brother power hungry to control them all became a beast this bear who took her fathers leg thinking they must return home to repair a tapestry they sneak back into their castle where they find everyone growing more restless merida decides to announce her decision but her mother posing as a bear statue at the back of the room redirects her otherwise finally understanding one another through time spent and a bond deeper than any ocean this mother and daughter love each other so much by the end of this movie i had shed more than a few tears and was glad just me and my daughter were watching it together the first time she came and sat on my lap in the theatre shes six and doesnt often do that so i think it affected her greatly too when it came out i managed to get it on black friday and put it up for her for xmas along with a few other brave goodies ella was thrilled she loves the movie so much shes watched it almost every day following xmas the first week and often since then she took the regular dvd copy to her dads so she could continue watching it there such a brilliant movie and i was thrilled it didnt revolve around romantic love for a change as that seems shoved down kids throats these days with disney princessand all not that we dislike those movies this was just very refreshing and heartwarming and a great mother daughter movie that we continue to enjoy and love together highly recommended to all stars plus 
excellent movie for all of the family we watched it on christmas eve very very funny in parts and also extremely sad in parts all of my family were laughing and also crying during this picture including teenagers i think the teenagers actually realated somewhat to kelly totally amazing 
disney is becoming a master of d animation the effects are very convincing but not so overdone as to become gimmicky the story is well written and the main character is a princess but not your typical disney princess she rides horses is a terrific archer and fights literally for her life and the life of her mother i wont give you anymore because that would spoil it buy this one its well worth it dont have a d setup yet buy this version anyway its got every option covered d bluray regular bluray dvd and digital 
 its not my fault we hear this familiar cry many times during the course of this exciting pg rated film a doughty red haired girl and her faithful horse are up against an old curse that has turned one scottish clan against another not only that our willful and stubborn princess is in full revolt against her mothers attempts to turn her into a lady she would much rather be in the forest with her bow and arrows or climbing rocks to test her courage the combination of pixar and disney gives us wonderful emotion with the mothers subtle expressions that ring true plus stunningly realistic animals the horse in particular is amazing although the bear is good too i didnt like the dogs voiced by kelly macdonald boardwalk empire is merida our tomboy princess who has long curly red hair and blue eyes the perfect scots lass ms macdonald was born in scotland but as an actress she plays any nationality no country for old men here we are treated to an authentic scots brogue emma thompson men in black iii is exquisite as a frustrated queen elinor struggling with her rebellious daughter who does not want to be a lady billy connolly gullivers travels is king fergus rambunctious brawling and with one peg leg due to an historic bout with a bear many years ago julie walters momma mia cackles her way around our heroine as the witch full of more trickery than teeth animation gets better and better plus the sound was outstanding the horses hoof beats were clearly those of a massive clydesdale rather than a regular size riding horse dont ask me how i know expect lots of brawling chaotic chase scenes and a truly violent fight between two bears bloodless but with lots of roaring claws and teeth not a child in our packed screening audience moved a muscle so ill be sure to tell my jayflix net folks when amazon has this available on dvd surprisingly even though this is disney there was no prince charming our little heroine is pretty self sufficient and then because this is disney our heroine finally owns up to her mistakes and admits it when something is her fault whew oh and be careful what you wish for 
this has become our new go to movie for family night in our household the animation is beautiful and keeps both the childrens and our attention the story line is heart warming too but it offers just enough scary stuff for our year old boys 
got this for my daughter we saw the movie and she has wanted it ever since she is getting other brave items this was well packaged came promptly and was exactly as described 
fairytales are traditional and nobody messes with tradition right price charming wins the hand of the fair princess and they live happily ever after but merida is a tomboy at heart with red unruly hair who loves riding horseback through the woods mastering an archery course and the princes from the neighboring clans are far from charming so of course merida seeks out a spell to change tradition and of course the spell goes all wrong in the end the real question isnt will they live happily ever after but who will learn from the experience i am so glad disney has created another anti princess like mulan not all girls have to love pink and fancy dresses some can wield swords or bows and fight for whats right there are a couple intense scenes that some may be sensitive too 
i saw this movie while in theaters and loved it since purchasing the blu ray and dvd i have enjoyed it many times it is a feel good family movie for all ages adults and children alike i watched this movie with my younger family members as well as my spouse complete with a lesson in communication and family ties it is a movie that should be cherished throughout the ages 
this is a wonderful story excellently done both in animation and voice acting this version has multiple formats to fit any needs 
what a great movie great story line good characters and just an overall good movie its about a princess who tries to change her fate and go against her mothers wishes but in the process finds something amazing along the way 
this is just a spectacular animated story merida is the princess daughter of king fegus and the beautiful queen elinor her mother wants her to be a perfect princess and a lady but merida is a tom boy at heart with a passion for challenges and archery and she is really fearless when it comes time to match her up with a suitable suitor for a husband from the sons of the clan tribe leaders merida has her own ideas she wants to be able to make her own decisions about how she will live her life this is a very cute story and the cgi graphics were outstanding this is a five star movie and it is an excellent film for children and adults alike the graphics design and animation of the film were some of the best that i have seen and the story line for the film was dramatic but well thought through the accents and the voices selected for the characters was just as well selected and performed my wife and i thought the film had a good premise and it was great to see how the movie flowed and it never left the plot line sticking to the final goal until the impeccable and exciting ending disney and pixar have another hit on their hands the film also had an excellent song track with some good music and songs and it really is a full package when it comes to an entertaining cgi adventure film i rate this movie stars and i recommend it to you 
this was a very cute movie a lot of action and having to do with the bond between mother and child will watch again 
great animation excellent story lots of fun for the whole family the crowd scenes are filled with great quips that the adults will appreciate 
had just about everything you could want in a family movie the kids all loved the movie and i admit that i did as well 
my daughter and i are scottish and enjoy movies that lean toward stories that have a scottish bent to them this movie was fun to watch and we thoroughly liked the character with her bright red hair it is a movie we will watch over and over 
my daughter came along a little later in life than her siblings i was when she was born she has made it to middle school now sometimes it feels awfully hard to find something that she and i really enjoy together i want to watch my macho tv shows while she plays on the laptop brave come out and i thought it looked cute i bought it sight unseen for my daughter the movie arrived the night my daughter had planned a sleepover with a couple of friends i popped the movie in and soon all three girls myself and my wife were enthralled the movie is clever with a message to be yourself but also be responsible there are some really fun situations billy connelly is of course great i will watch the movie again and again i hope it is a thing my daughter and i can share with hot chocolate popcorn and a lot of laughs 
the animated movie brave is an excellent family adventure for all the proud wee scots and those who wish they were i very highly recommend this show for an evening of family fun 
i avoided this movie because i didnt know i would like it home with my daughter i finally decided to watch it its a good movie and im afraid that i love it i watched it twice 
i laughed hysterically during this movie there are so many funny parts there is a good message behind it too classic pixar kind of movie 
this is a great movie and my kids love it pixar and disney knock another one out of the park with this movie 
this movie is great for all ages i have seen adults and children alike sit and not want to leave when watching it 
i was surprised at how clever this movie is very imaginative and lots of fun the triplets are a scream little devils dont let the animated descriptive put you off this movie is more entertaining than most films 
merida the protagonist of brave may be the spunkiest disney heroine yet my favorite line occurs after her suitors vie for her hand in an archery match merida leaves her throne steps into the arena and shouts i am merida and im shooting for my own hand 
the whole family watches this movie and we love that we have it on the road as well as at home it is fabulous 
family get together three little kids were funny and adorable wished i had seen it in three dimensional love this types of flicks
we saw this at the show and we loved it we pre ordered it and have watched it over and over the one bear was a bit scary for our yr old grandson who we do not let see most movies but after he saw the story through he was good with it cant say enough about how much we love it 
some of the background is photo real which is a great advance for pixar which started behind pinocchio in that regard the characters are better rounded than most disney characters and the action had me at the edge of my seat the only draw back is that this movie may scare very small children 
my daughter just loves this one and so do i it is a really neat story with laughter and seriousness all wrapped up om this one little flick 
even my husband enjoyed sitting and watching this one with me the movie was well done and we enjoyed it very much
this movie made for a great family movie night i was worried that the mean bear might scare my four year old but she loved the movie 
ever since the first toy story film rolled into theaters i have greatly enjoyed pixars contributions to disneys animated films it seems that no matter what genre they decide to tackle be it superhero movies the incredibles dystopian science fiction wall e tearjerking oscar contenders up and even culinary movies ratatoullie they come up with winners even their critically panned cars movies have been a step above a lot of modern animated movies and i cant think of with a single pixar film that i didnt just enjoy but love brave is no exception and after so many years of suffering through the pastel colored girly girl world of the disney princesses its refreshing and wonderful to see a princess who can hold her own and the film looks gorgeous to boot brave chronicles the story of merida princess of a scottish kingdom who prefers horseback riding and archery to etiquette and embroidery much to the consternation of her proper and dignified mother when her mother announces that merida must soon marry in order to prevent a clan feud from overtaking the kingdom she runs away and decides to change her fate by consulting an eccentric witch in the forest the witch grants her wish but it comes at an unexpected cost and merida must take responsibility and act quickly to save both her mother and the kingdom from the consequences of the spell this film looks absolutely stunning pixar apparently had to rewrite its graphics software for this movie and it shows in graphics that are top notch the scottish highlands serve as a magnificent backdrop for this story creating a world that looks almost real hair and fur are well rendered as well meridas hair in particular is a wild tangle that must have been a nightmare to render but looks real enough to touch the story has come under criticism by some for being average and not showcasing meridas talents enough i feel its a wonderful fairy tale however and is a great coming of age story and the moral of the story is a timely one that i think all children and parents should learn that our choices have consequences and we must take responsibility for our actions for better or for worse i must also give special mention to the sounds of this movie the music and the voice cast the music a combination of traditional orchestral score and bagpipe music fits the story like a glove with additional vocal songs woven in seamlessly and after seeing so many films that are supposed to take place in foreign countries but have a jarrinly american sounding voice cast its refreshing to hear authentic british and scottish voices in this film the voice cast does a wonderful job bringing the characters to life i personally consider this one of pixars best films yet and one of the best disney fairy tales and princess stories in a long time merida is a worthy addition to the disney princess roster and could probably run circles around snow white and cinderella though i think shed get along well with mulan best suited for children and up due to some scary moments 
my kids love this movie there is no age that should not like this i am older and still enjoyed this 
ill admit brave doesnt have quite the wall to wall boldness rule breaking and sheer brilliance of the very bestof pixars work but ill still take it over of the hollywood films ive seen this year it never bored me it mademe smile a lot laugh a little and was a more touching look at the complexity of mother and daughterrelationships than most grown up films that try to deal with the subject it also has a heroine who is a spunky tough and first rate advocate for girl power while still being heart meltingly vulnerableat just the right moments it has tremendously talented voice actors in billy connolly kelly maccdonald and especially emma thompson most important it has a twist half way through that takes it in a delightfully unexpected direction i will admit for the firsthalf i was a bit under whelmed the film seemed more disney than pixar with safe humor and ideas just a touch disappointingly predictable but then a witch gets involved in this medieval scottish tale and with a twist thats more shakespearian comedy than disney suddenly this isa new film we havent seen before the second half easily won me back over and i was left feeling as i always seem to be that workingfor pixar must be just about the greatest job in movies 
pixar has made several movies as we all know but thismovie is indeed exceptional and marvelous all ageswill enjoy everything about the movie the irishin brave was outstanding and the lessons to be learnedare outstanding as well
this is not your typical damsel in distress movie where a prince comes and saves her in this movie its all about female power it doesnt even have a prince involved which is the best part because it sends a very important message about the female gender we dont need a male to come and rescue us because we are fragile no we can do it all on our own this movie is a defenite must see its empowering to women and little girls finally a movie from disney that actually empowers the princess to live hapily ever after without its night and shining armor 
what a fantabulous story this animated movie is one of the best i will definately be buying this and watching it over and over 
this is a cute movie that boys and girls both will enjoy the story is about a nontraditional girl and how she refuses to change great movie for the whole family 
all you haters at the s and s this was in the way of a classic folk yarn with simple story and simple values it was a fun cute movie and well worth watching you had me going there now i am only sad i waited so long to watch it believing you all this time 
disney and pixar are at their best very moving beautiful funny tender emotional movie top notch animation and love the soundtrack 
actually this one was for me it was recommended to me by my daughter i didnt think i would but i liked it it was cute 
i really enjoyed watching this movie since i raised both of my daughters to be strong independent young ladies i saw our relationships unfold throughout this disney animated story 
very cute and intertaining movie love the graphics and the red hair the brothers were very cute and cuddly enjoyable 
last year disney pixar created cars the first critical disappointment film and box office disappointment that was saved by merchandise sales that everyone agreed it was the worst film even it didnt look like pixar that this years brave tries to bring pixar back to basics with a story of a princess that seeks out her destiny until she comes a witch that changes things for her and her family that now shes got to save her mother before its too late and figuring herself out not pixars best or worst film but its a start thats what i said on opening weekend when me and friend went to see it it was good and another female character this year that doesnt need men saving her that she can take care of herself just like katniss from the hunger games pixars back in business and coming from a guy that seen pixars straight films in theatres included enjoyed cars so much buy brave on blu ray blu ray d and dvd soon 
i love how pixar always presents a moral with every story with a lot of hidden adult innuendos what a great story 
very nice love the animation music characters and accents extremely well developed or it couldnt bring tears a great family tv movie nite show for all ages very worth a viewing 
this was a cute movie i cant stay away from disney im in my mid twenties and i cant help getting a little pumped to see some of these cutesy movies i thought this was a great show and i will watch it again 
my year old granddaughter just loves this movie having a female heroine is perfect for her the first time she watched it she turned to grandma and said grandma can i go their and play too 
arrived tuesday via pre ordered wonderful sealed new all versions included so glad to have it thank you this is a great great movie story what incredible animation detail fascinating a must have 
i just love disney movies so i had to have this one it is one of the best movies disney has put out since the little mermaid even my year old son liked it 
pixars animated feature brave stands apart from the wealth of princess based movies which came before it where most princesses sit around gazing moonily at a bird and hoping for a prince to rescue them merida picks up her own sword takes charge of her own life and at the end of the film is still proudly carving her own path putting off thoughts of marriage until later it is quite clear from the very beginning that the team at pixar knew what they were doing in the archery and sword fighting scenes ive taken medieval swordfighting classes for several years and have spent far more years attending reenactments and watching swordplay the movements in brave are nearly perfect in many cases they were exactly what i was taught to do i remember thinking in a pivotal scene where merida holds off an assailant with her sword hey i know that pose in the commentary we learn that the team did know how to sword fight and mapped out all the combat sequences in real life before transferring them to the screen so these arent just fantasy versions of sword fights they are realistic authentic looks as to how these swords were handled the same is true for the archery they show the details about how the arrow bends as it flies the way the bow is held and so on its true that meridas mom is not thrilled about meridas sword and bow interests but that conflict between mother and daughter is the whole heart of the film meridas mom has one specific track in mind her for daughter become part of a clan merger and to be fair this was often the way marriage was in medieval times nobles had to ensure their land was protected and their borders secure it was a quite practical situation so the mothers stance is understandable so is the daughters i give the story great praise sure its a bit predictable we could almost recite some of the lines along with the characters knowing what they were likely to say still the underlying message is wonderful and miles apart from the snow white snow white sat around waiting for her prince to come with no thought of doing anything for herself merida has plenty she wants to do with her life and has little interest in a prince coming to take control well recommended 
great artwork great message great lil story it will be a hit at christmas my daughter will enjoy receiving this 
we saw the d version of this movie in the theatre and love it then so when i saw it for sale i couldnt resist this is such a great movie for older kids because of the story line 
ok i am usually not a cry in my pop corn bowl type of girl but this one just did it i have three daughters so you can see why it resonated with me and them i dont buy many movies now but this one was one i definitely had to own i enjoyed the story the accents and all the characters and with a lightning deal of bucks i loved it even more 
christmas present for my granddaughter who saw the movie and loved it so i thought she would like having to watch when she wants
my son loves this movie and so do i we watched on amazon instant and it was great do yourself a favor and watch it with your kids 
as usual pixar never fails to disappoints people with their films brave is a fantastic film people of all ages the most noticeable aspect about this film like other pixar movies is the animation i was blown by the high definition resolution there was a part in the film in which it appeared to be like it was live action while watching the film the audience may find the meridas hair to appear just like real human hair the vivid colors with keep your eyes glued to the television also the story is pretty interesting since this is a family movie people might believe it has the same traditional plot as other films brave delivers an interesting synopsis and keeps the audience engaged the film has a pretty decent score as well the music is not as great as other disney films but still good also the special features include two magnificent pixar shorts pixar shorts are amazing as all the previous ones before stunning resolution after watching the film i would recommend watching the short the legend of mordu in the bonus content it is an interesting and relates to the film if you have enjoyed previous pixar films there is no doubt you will love this one as well disney and pixar continues to make films with stunning animation and characters the audience can easily understand 
wonderful animation and acting while a great cartoon experience it was also a touching movie about growth loved it i would see it again 
this is one movie to add to your collection of entertainment the plot the animation the effects the color and the folks at pixar has done it again when you see anything with pixar on the label grab it disney was smart enough for once to see the writing on the wall these folks have such a grasp on what the world wants to see it is one of the best all time greats it will match anything disney has out there i watched it four times in one day it is that good 
i saw this movie in the theatre with my daughters and we all enjoyed it so i had to add it to our collection i purchased it just before a trip to see family at thanskgiving and it really helped with the car ride 
brave the latest animated feature from disney and pixar adds to the pantheon of disney princesses in the form of a head strong strong willed highland lassie named merida who has a big problem that is soon compounded by a bigger problem merida who is all red hair and sharp mouth is a royal princess whose parents want her to marry one of the sons of various highland clan leaders the problem is that she would rather not instead she would rather gallop about on her huge horse shooting arrows at everything in sight her father the king of scotland is indulgent while her mother the queen is anxious that her little girl become a proper princess and learn how to submit to her duty merida instead makes an unwise bargain with a witch and then has a bigger problem on her hands concerning her mother the animation which shows an idealized scottish highlands is gorgeous enough to be breathtaking the music as is proper is very generous with the bagpipes and often soars along with the landscape if touch the sky does not win an oscar for best song in a feature length film there is no justice in the world and no taste in hollywood it is the fate of a lot of mothers and daughters to tussle when the later passes puberty the story of brave relates how merida and her mother wage this battle and how they work through their issues while dealing with a potentially dangerous enchantment there is also lessons about responsibility getting what one wishes for and listening once in a while to ones irritating teenagers the voice talent is exemplary and actual scottish actors are well represented including billy connolly as king fergus craig ferguson kevin mckidd and robbie coltrane as the lairds whose sons are vying for the hand of merida and kelly mcdonald as merida herself there are some scary dark parts in the film so parents should be cautious about bringing younger or more sensitive children to see it but aside from that brave is a true family film which everyone can enjoy 
this is one of the best animated feature films out there its great for everyone in the family even the birds cats dogs fish and the lizard so gather everyone around the tv and get some family time in and love the ones youre with 
i am a disney geek so it was almost certain id like this movie but because it wasnt highly rated when it came out my expectations were a little low so it was a very pleasant suprise when the movie was so wonderful the princess is this movie is not the standard disney princess and more realistic for that it was a wonderful way to escape reality for just a little while 
i bought this film and really enjoyed it which is odd since i dont watch a lot of films and im not a fan of cartoons either but i loved this film its cute and i also enjoyed the scottish accent of the characters 
great movie and great job this is a real collectors film from pixar will become a classic in time blu ray is very well put together 
watched it over and over again on my amazon video rental that i bought the dvd hows that for brave 
i wasnt sure i would like this film since some of my standby reviewers had given it a thumbs down i loved it yes there is some magic its disney and the daughter is rebellious but in the end it shows that love and respect are what is important since we lived in scotland for years i particularly enjoyed the cultural aspects of the movie as an added bonus the main character of merida looks remarkably like my sweet friend kathleen 
i have thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was a definite good pick for my home video library its good for all ages young and old alike 
i thought this film was the right length cute its storyline captured a different timeline different culture was made to be entertaining for all age groups just so easy to download from amazon video watch nice to relax on a sunday afternoon when you have the time 
this movie was very inturesting and very funny and emotional i cant wait for my mother to watch it so that we can talk about it i think the movie is a reflection of me mine and my mothers relationship 
this was a wonderfully funny movie with loveable characters and a nice plot line its nice to see a strong disney princess who knows her mind and fights for what she believes in but still humble enough to learn the lesson at the end of the film 
family safe and entertaining in many respects the story was compelling and seemingly original to me with plenty of small funny asides 
my grandson had seen this once and just loved it so we saw it again it is well done and has just enough scary scenes to keep the children on their toes and the edge of their seats 
when this came out in the movie theatres i knew i had to take my daughter to see it due to the sneak previews i had seen on the daughter mother relationship my daughter wanted to see it because there is an actual character now that has her hair not red but big long poofy and really really cury she curled up on me watching this in the theatre and did the same at home when we watched it again great movie 
our family enjoyed it even our year old son it was better than we expected it to be cute funny and enjoyable 
very good and pretty movie the picture quality is amazing everything is so clear and bright the story is a good and unique very enteraining both young and old would enjoy great for the family great buy 
brave is a spectacular movie the animation is perfect the colors are so bright and rich and the detail is top notch the d is wonderful though there are not alot of pop outs the depth is fantastic it really helps to show the vastness of the movie even while watching in d this movie doesnt lose alot of color which is a big plus my only complaint with the d is that is doesnt full up the whole screen you get the black bars on top and bottom and i think that kind of hurts a d movie but thats just my opinion the story itself was really great it was nice to see such a strong willed female lead i have read a few negative reviews about nudity but there is no need to worry it was just a few bare butts and nothing else hell you see worse on tv i say buy this one especially if you have younger children i have five kids boys and girls with the oldest being and they all loved this movie as did my wife and i hope you enjoy it as much as we did 
pixar animation studios has always been known for their unique approach to filmmaking they have always put the story first and foremost something that so many other studios seem to take for granted they also know the rest of the ingredients to add to make their films stand out from the rest great characters lots of heart and a goodly quantity of humor while not continuing the st century tradition of turning the fairy tale on its head as in the case of shrek brave feels like a rediscovered story by grimms with an unmistakably pixarian flavor legends and myths abound in scots folklore and the writers at pixar didnt have far to go in order to come up with their own story one that is at once relevant quite original and yet entirely congruous with ones expectations of the perfect fairy tale as fresh and surprising as any of the studios previous successes i enjoyed it immensely and could watch it many times over without growing tired of it its hard to find a real family film that everyone can enjoy together but this one comes pretty to close to that ideal in the ultimate cautionary tale of being careful what you wish for the film set in th century scotland concerns princess merida a feisty strong willed adventure seeking lass skilled with both a sword and a bow and arrow who would rather practice archery and ride through the woods with her horse angus than follow the path desired for her by her parents or more specifically her mother determined to avoid her fate she runs away and manages to find a way to alter her destiny to make a long story short this ill chosen wish sets off a chain of events that threaten to destroy everything merida holds dear and the entire kingdom of dunbroch along with it this fresh take on a typical princess character pleasantly surprised me as well as the fact that the emotional core of the film as well as most of the plot stems not from a romantic relationship between prince and princess but from the mother daughter relationship between merida and queen elinor anyone who is a daughter like i am will easily relate to how complicated the bond can be between a mother and her child and this film portrays that unique bond beautifully without giving too much away it is their love for each other and their clashing of personalities that ultimately moves the entire film forward and the changes they both experience throughout the course of the film give them both a better understanding of each other and emphasize the importance of empathy bravery courage family and love not content with just being an entertaining theatrical experience the film goes into a level of moral and emotional depth that even fans of pixar may be unfamiliar with it takes a very special film to bring me to tears and i was moved quite often not to say that brave is strictly a tear jerker because it is not id estimate that there is more action adventure and humor than in any other pixar movie to date there is no doubt that brave is one of pixars most beautifully animated films the amount of detail is simply brilliant and computer technology being what it is today there are times when the visuals on screen almost rival the real world ive never been to scotland but the richness and beauty of the country expressed in the film makes me feel as if i had the landscapes are simply breathtaking and so photo realistic you might feel as if youve just fallen into the wilds of the highlands im sure that more than one viewing would be needed to absorb it all the rendering on the hair and fabric is especially lifelike and certain scenes involving non human characters might make you do a double take they appear so true to life composer patrick doyles score is appropriately scottish in flavor combining the expected gaelic melodies jigs reels and such like with more modern atmospheric incidental scoring sprightly where it needs to be and brooding where it doesnt it perfectly enhances the movie to the point that it feels as organic as the moss on the trees the gentle lullaby a mhaighdean bhan uasal sung by emma thompson is one of the stand out pieces and serves as the kind of musical representation of the love between merida and elinor i also quite enjoyed song of mordu a sort of scotch drinking song heard mainly in the background but reiterated often throughout the rest of the score there are also three other songs touch the sky and into the open air performed by scots songstress julie fowlis and learn me right sung by birdy with mumford and sons which while not written by doyle fit expertly into their places in the story and aptly enhance the film now a good animated character needs a good voice to bring them to life and the entire cast is all very well chosen and very well acted comprised mainly of scottish and english actors including billy connolly as king fergus emma thompson as queen elinor robbie coltrane as lord dingwall julie walters as the witch and the incomparable kelly macdonald as merida herself it would be hard to find another group of people so perfect in their roles macdonald is wonderful as the flame haired heroine and thompson simply shines as the equally obstinate but caring mother billy connolly is a great counterpoint to her more level headed and dutiful queen but gets far less screen time than either of the two female protagonists to sum it all up brave is a beautiful touching exciting and refreshingly original film one that is entertaining on so many levels and can stand proudly alongside any of pixars previous masterpieces i would rank it as one of my favorite if not my favorite pixar film and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone 
so happy that they made a red curly hair girl movie its about time my girl has curly hair and she was so happy about the girl having curly hair 
great movie i was thoroughly entertained i think i need to own this one animations were amazing great story line five stars 
this movie is great for kids and adults alike it is inspiring emotional and funny i highly recommend it and the pixar work is amazing 
i loved it i loved the sweet scotland brogue i loved the contemporary theme that things never change wise and well meaning parents still loving and wanting the best for their kids young people still wanting independence and at the same time still wanting to be a kid in their hearts both with things to yet learn and a happy ending perfect 
this charming movie is wonderful all the way through i even love the ending and that is not a common thing 
i watched the movie brave with my family and we all really enjoyed it be sure to grab a box of tissues beforehand as there are some tear jerking scenes the story is about a queen who is training her daughter into becoming a princess and according to tradition a prince is selected to marry the princess upon proving himself through competitions the princess wants her own freedom to choose and fights with her mother on this she symbolically tears her mother out of the family by cutting a tapestry with the family in it and seeks a witch to help her mother change her mother does change but not her heart rather she becomes a bear the story is a lesson of choosing freedom over tradition it is also about a love shared between family members that is unbreakable since merida instantly regrets what she did to her mother and will go to any lengths to bring her back the movie is action packed unlike many of the disney princess movie this one lacks on the romantic side however this only adds to the movies uniqueness it is more family based than romantic based very good movie to watch with the family 
this is an excellent meaning with a great new meaning for brave this will encourage all to embrace their fearless nature 
very exciting movie my y o son enjoyed it too excellent mix of humor adventure and a great story line 
i have fallen off being a big disney fan of late i think the superior movie making skills of dream works has spoiled me that said brave has gone a long way in redeeming disney in my eyes i rented it mostly because it features three of my favorite actors with emma thompson doing a lovely job as queen elinore and billy connelly as king fergus and julie walters as the witch kelly macdonald is spot on as merida and craig ferguson and robbie coltrane are wonderful as always its visually stunning and the celtic music is wonderful the story is as unbelievable as well sherik but hey it is a cartoon i mean animated feature eye roll i thoroughly enjoyed this charming movie and intend to buy the d version 
this movie was fantastic a very positive reinforcement for girls but enough action and fun for everyone i am an adult disney fan saw this movie with another adult we both loved it 
a great movie i would definitely recommend children and adults will enjoy this movie the characters are portrayed with great humor 
the best animated movie ive seen since lion king im simply blown away by the story and execution of this movie very good story with a great moral must have for any family 
i bought this a gift for a five year old for christmas it was just what she wanted i may have to get one for myself
merida is a princess who must be married to a worthy suitor however merida just wants to be free to marry whoever she wants if thats what she chooses in her anger towards her mother she tears the family tapestry in a backlash of anger her mother throws meridas beloved bow in the fire merida runs away and instantly the queen regrets her actions and removes the bow merida is desperate to change her mother because that will change her fate shes desperate to will her to see things differently and not force merida into a marriage she doesnt want merida stumbles across a witch that will help to change the queen unfortunatly the queen is changed into a bear its such a funny and heartwarming story teaching us to be careful what we wish for my favorite part is probably when the boys help merida get their mom out of the castle it was way to funny so often do we see movies about princesses looking for a prince and an evil step mother who is determined to ruin it all merida and her mother change in several ways learning to love and accept each other for who they are i laughed i cried i really enjoyed this movie and was glad i took the kids to see it in theaters this movie will make a great addition to our movie collection 
bought this one for the grandkids it is such a good lesson about what girls can do well worth seeing very well done 
what a wonderful movie we watched it with our grandchildren and they want to watch it again and again we will give a copy to our graddaughter 
this is another well done animated movie great color i thoroughly enjoyed it but it may be a bit too intense scary in places for the little ones 
very good visual production good characters and story line message of values and family is storyline fun movie action story and humor 
the movie had plenty of action yet the sound track didnt chase us from the room it was a classic theme with a pleasant mix of her prankster brothers who come to the rescue i liked the ghosts spirits that take her from one adventure to another 
disney provides a great movie wonderful in its entertainment value and has a lesson to teach everyone it was a whole range of emotions and more definitely a great mother daughter movie as well with plenty of comedy in it and never a dull moment 
if youve not seen the movie its a no brainer to rent or buy its a great film and wonderfully animated it has all the formulaic elements needed to make it enjoyable for the kids and watchable for the adults the story is rich and the message is authentic flawless reproduction in visual and sound love it 
ive already watched it twice the animation is amazing in this movie as well as the story line itself i can see myself watching this on a f few times over 
i dont go nuts over most of these pixar or other animated movies but taken as a whole this movie was excellent interesting story plenty of action small spoiler there was a fight between two bears that was excellent 
few animated movies bring me to tears but this one did my ancestry is ireland scotland and this movie really hit home with me it also reminded me of my granddaughter you really must watch this 
my kids were skeptical i dont think the trailer drew them in but once it started it captured their attention and was quite funny more than any of us expected our entire family had a great time watching brave there was nothing too scary about it plenty of action and humor nothing offensive 
my wife her friend and i watch this movie last night we are all three adults and we thoroughly enjoyed this movie there are parts that we all laughed and made us smile i would definitely recommend everyone watching this movie no matter what age you are you will enjoy it 
i enjoyed this tremendously the characters storyline and setting were exquisite there was actually a really scary bear i didnt expect the bad guy to be so bad great family film
i watched this movie with my year olds and we loved it it really held their attention and got them to connect with the characters the movie had a great moral lesson as well 
this movies was sooo awesome when i seen the previews i knew it would be one i would buy after watching it i was amazed
brave is a fairy tale about coming of age much like snow white disneys snow white produced in the thirtys was a landmark cinematic achievement brave shows that animation is still the ticket for fairy tales i love celtic folklore and the mystical highlands of britain and ireland in general this movie is perfect for me if you enjoy celtic legends and fairly stories this movie is absolutely for you 
if you dont own it yet you certanily need to get this disney classic and add it to your collection it will be a treasure for years to come 
saw the previews of this on tv and thought that we would check it out its better than the previews and a good additionto our collection 
this movie was so amazing i would like to watch it more times in a row and i would probably cry every time merida was so brave obviously but when her mother got turned into a bear and wouldnt go back to human form when merida put the blanket on her my entire family started crying great movie 
brave hd kelly macdonaldhow do ir ate this product love it brave hd kelly macdonaldhow do ir ate this product love it 
im loving these new computer generated stories especially from this producer theyre always great beautifully done and fun to watch absolutely great little movie 
bought this for a christmas present for some of our grand kids and they loved it it was in good condition 
its mind blowing what the artists behind pixar animation can accomplish with digital tools a few minutes into the film and you forget its animated the color and detail are stunning and more importantly the story is good for both genders and all ages unless youre a particularly cold hearted grumpy sort what i particularly liked is that this film is female positive and empowering without being preachy feminist to the point of irritation it just flatly states that boys girls should have equal opportunities in life to choose their dreams and their paths the story avoids the cliche father son or boy girl and instead focuses on mother daughter in ways not usually seen in films moving beyond the marry who you have to and love will follow down the road to an exploration of children needing to rethink their blind rebellion at all costs and parents move beyond blind adherence to legacy traditions that may be antediluvian and beyond all that its a reference quality hd movie to show off your hdtv blu ray to those who still question the value of hd anything 
an awesome disney movie a must watch funny fun entertaining i dont believe any family member will be disappointed 
we love amazon videos on demand there is a great selection it always works as expected and of course has totally replaced renting and or purchasing dvds for us so convenient and such a great selection i had wanted to see this movie and saw in on amazon video on demand one day so we watched it 
fun and a bit silly we all laugh and enjoy sitting together and watching brave well written keeps you entertained and worthy of constant watching when i look to get a movie for the kids i want it to be something that everyone will enjoy and will want to be watched over and over brave definitely fell in that category with the multiple disc we can take it in the car also we love this movie 
my daughter enjoyed this movie at the theaters and now seems like everyday at home great movie for kids even better for girls gives them a sense that they can accomplish anything 
great movie for the family my daughter loved it its good to watch on movie nights everyone should enjoy it
this movie is action packed all the way through its fun for everyone with some educational elements and lots of beautiful scenery great vivid color and a level cg animation great hard hitting action and sound effects on blue ray its a great unique storyline there are no dry areas in this movie its put together very well buy it on blue ray thank you 
i always buy movies for us to watch with the grandchildren we all loved it and grampa and i will watch it by ourselves 
i rented this one for my grandchildren and they loved it your children will probably love it also i recommend this one 
great family film on d and cannot wait to see it again i am so glad we own this movie everyone should no matter if you have kids or not 
even though i do not have young children i decided to rent this movie i loved it a good lesson to learn love and respect your mother 
this movie is amazing its beautiful funny touching and a good fast paced story that will keep both children and adults boys and girls entertained princess merida doesnt want to be just a princess she wants to carve her own path her own destiny and show what she can really do in this world and in so doing she learns not only can a lady be a fighter but that a fighter can be a lady there are bits in there for the entire family and youre missing out if you dont watch this gem plus the animation is just beautiful and the story is amazingly original its not a one dimensional damsel story or a two dimensional girl power story either its about the power of family and love and its just adorably raucous and funny king fergus queen helena and the princes hubert hamish and hargus adorable plus i just love the accents and the music cant recommend this highly enough i didnt think they could outdotangled which i adore but theyve managed it 
we are in our mid s and we went to see this movie at the theaters we loved it laughed out loud with the kids at the theater i bought this for our first grandchild who was just born two weeks ago this is a must for all families 
really like this original movie it is so clear and bright i know all blu rays are clearer but this one is awesome in quality my family loves it and am glad they created a new and visually unique heroin 
this was a nice movie for the family to watch myself and my daughter both had a good time watching this film 
this was a birthday present for my little cousins they hadnt seen it yet so they were super excited to open this and loved it 
great cartoon flick with action adventure parenting issues child issues and real life drama made a little more interesting story was good even if magic was involved but if you like cartoon movies and your children do this will be a good one i will purchase it for my daughter soon 
i really like this movie in addition to kid o really really liking it i like the story and the characters are well written 
ive already watched this times once on my own then with my wife and then with my daughter it is a sweet film and i really enjoyed the archery scenes i am an avid archer and the archery scenes were very realistic get this dvd and enjoy it with the family 
i love good animation especially when it is a classic fantasy tale i had it on my wish list but when santa didnt bring it i ordered it for myself and i dont regret it for a minute 
typical mother daughter coming of age angst nice to have a mother and a father in a loving relationship the animation is great storyline easy to follow 
i originally bought this because my son loves shrek and i had seen all the movies way too many times sorry big green guy i was hoping that maybe it was the accent that he liked and this would add some variety to our viewing turns out it was the accent that he liked and the the three princes entertain him greatly it also turns out that i learned this is one of the most beautiful stories ever put in a movie let alone animated there is something for everyone what i truly love is the optimistic outlook the movie ends on and the beautiful scenery throughout 
you cant go wrong with a pixar movie so well done and the story is very entertaining and super spellbinding for children my granddaughter loves it and would watch it every day if she could 
loved the story and the characters the flaming red hair and the scottish accents are delightful the father is a big lovable guy 
the family bond the freedom to choose your own destiny and the opportunity to be yourself not what the world wants you to be are all in this movie great family entertainment probably one of the best disney pixar films since toy story 
this will be one of those movies like sound of music was for me for my granddaughter her christmas wish was for a bow and arow go figure
i bought this tape for my great nephew for christmas also because it was another one of his favorites i might add that i also loved the movie 
i like animation i especially like a good story this one was fun and had a good story i liked it 
had to watch it twice it was so great truth wisdom and humor all put together in way for children to enjoy the so called nudity scene come on the short take of cartoon butts is not something i would be afraid for my or yr old to see this is a must see if you have a daughter it is an inspiration to the strength of the so named fair sex my daughter can do anything a man can do and i encourage her to follow her dreams where ever they may lead disney and pixar really out did themselves with this one i plan to buy this movie it is one of those you share and watch over again and again a new movie for my collection that few get to be a part of 
great movie its so great to see a disney movie that is not about romantics instead its a very unique and sweet story about a mother and daughter the detail and graphics were excellent and the cast really drew me into the story i really enjoyed watching this over and over again with my four year old niece who like to act like the little bear brothers while i personally and secretly wish that i had meridas archery skill and her beautiful shire horse definitely full of giggles thrills suspense and even a touching tear jerker moment 
we didnt watch this movie when it first came out because the previews didnt leave me thinking i wanted to see it a daughter asked for it for christmas turns out its a fantastic movie great entertainment among other things the artists did an incredible job with the young lasss red hair 
we went to the theater to see this rented it at least a half dozen times from various places and had to two purchase two copies one for a little one and one for a teen outstanding movie 
this movie was very funny and had my grandson and husband laughing all through it it was well priced and came quickly 
i just love this story and the quality of the animation we are starting to slow down on how many dvds we get so we are getting pickier about which ones we buy this is such a good movie my year old son also loves the movie 
bought this for my granddaughter at christmas it was a good deal for everyone i was able to keep one copy here at my house so she can watch it when she is here she was thrilled to have a blu ray edition to keep at home you know how kids are they will watch the same movie over and over and she already has 
as typical with pixar this movie is a strong original outing a young warrior princess merida rebels against her familys attempts to arrange a marriage for her she journeys into the woods and finds a witch who allows merida to cast a spell on her mother turning her into a giant bear through adventures and her father attempting to hunt the bear both merida and her family realize that allowing each to find their own destiny is best the visuals and particularly the scenery and background are lush and gorgeous pixar continues to push the boundaries of animation and the movie is a treat to watch they continue to improve the animation of the animals and the people and as usual for pixar the story is fresh and original though in this case it feels like a traditional scottish fairy tale highly recommended for families or fans of animation 
so not only can the grandkids be entertained but so am i this movie has a good message for kids be yourself yet at the same time be careful of what you wish for the picture and audio quality are great and not much to distract you from the entertainment youre likely interested in the movie as youre reading these reviews so buy it already 
great family movie especially for mothers and duaghters who may not always see eye to eye great moral and love the idea of strong mother daughter theme and not having to rely on prince charming 
yes there really is discs a light n dark fun movie with some very funny scenes the mcguffin was very funny made scotland look great 
this is a great movie again by pixar good mix of comedy drama and action the plot is great not many weaknesses i would suggest this movie 
first off i should probably make note that brave has received a lot of negative reviews with the consensus being that its not pixars best movie i would like to point out that just because it is not their best movie that does not mean that it should necessarily receive a bad review pixar has had a long standing history of fine animated films being their best is quite a challenge saying that this is a bad movie for not being their best is like saying shakespeares coriolanus is bad because it is not hamlet also this is far from their worst movie looking at you cars brave is simply a fairy tale and i say that with the highest compliments after all what were disney classics like snow white or cinderella but fairy tales fairy tales are meant to be somewhat simple stories that entertain and impart a moral in that regard i think brave is a huge success im not saying it is pixars best film though i would personally rank it there im saying it shouldnt be dismissed the plot follows a princess who is forced to well be rather princessy shed rather be an archer and could fight with the rest of them considering this is set in mythical scotland thats saying quite a bit as her mother forces her into taking suitors she goes to a witch in order to change her mother so that she may have her freedom this backfires to say the least for more than that i suggest you see the movie the only other thing i will say is that for those who say that the bear sequences came out of nowhere they were foreshadowed throughout the beginning watch it again enough about plot on to technical aspects visually the film is stunning the animation is grand and meridas hair looks amazingly real i was honestly distracted from the plot a few times on my first view just because i wanted to focus on the animation some scenes are simply breathtaking the blu ray completely does honor to the visual look of the film and the d disc is some of the best d ive ever seen while i am not a huge fan of d films personally it adds a lot to the atmosphere of the old castles and the fog at night there are enough special features to keep both kids and adults entertained from pixars classic short films related to the movie to a very in depth commentary that animation fans will find very interesting all in all i have to give brave as a movie a by my own personal rating system the film was an enjoyable fairy tale with a fun story and beautiful animation the blu ray presentation is easily a out of and outclasses visually any other animated disk ive ever seen both in terms of d and standard presentation brave is easily one of the must own films this year 
i thought this movie was fantastic as good a picture as any pixar film the animation is very special and in d it is wow i loved this movie it was thoughtful and full of action and funny and scary and wise it had everything plus it was a realoriginal i just loved it and thought it was everything i would want in an animated film it had guts and it had heart 
it was terrific the whole family loved it the story the color the sound all awesome will watch again and again 
my daughter loves it i love it i have nothing bad to say about it at all my daughter has already watched it twice amazing graphics and real keeper of a movie 
great movie for the whole family nice to see a girl as the hero hard to find good movies for the family with out all the sex and blood 
this is a great story i loved the mother and daughter dynamics after seeing it in the theater i knew i had to own it 
no spoiler here only praisepixar does movies in a special way no matter what visually technical movie they want to make they hold the animators at bay until the story is just right it is why we followed a fish on a journey to find his son felt for a robot as it discovered love and had our hearts strung by a cowboy toy who feels tossed aside like yesterdays news i have no idea why i ever doubted that brave would work as well as past pixar hits but i admit i expected it to be nothing more than a money grab movie one might come to the thought that this movie was only so disney could have a red headed princess from scotland to market to little girls i walked into the movie thinking that very thing and was knocked out by how much i enjoyed it regardless of the whether or not this movie was green lighted to fit a toy market the pixar touch gave it such strength both visually and emotionally i tossed away my prejudious i had on such thoughts although there is humor of easy steriotypes in the movie that makes me feel that disney had a finger or two in the pie the pace of the movie screamed pixar there never seemed to be a conflict in the movie that was thrown in to only shock and grab your attention every scene was purposeful and seemlessly flowed into the next the artwork was beautiful and i was pulling for the characters through the movie the relationships between the mother and daughter was realistic yet also shows young girls how to be independent yet respectful too often movies and shows have children who start off snotty rebels and by the end are still snotty heroes its nice to see a movie where they still show a girl who is independent yet any snotty actions show real consequence by the end you can see the real developement of the hero and want to root for her as a parent i loved how the story was enjoyed by the whole family and my girls left the theatre with a real role model to pretend to be the music was beautiful and celic style made up for any overtly commercial sounding pop theme its not going to be toy story but i felt this movie was well worth the ticket price and will be added movie to the collection 
i love this a strong princess that wants control of her own choices in life not a damsel in need of rescuing great connection that touch on mother daughter trials 
have you ever considered how rare a mother is in a disney animated film usually there is no mother or she is killed off quickly this story might explain why because the teens wish is that her mother would change so she could be free to become the woman she desires she gets her wish by placing her mother in danger this movie gets so much about teens right including the normal self absorption lack of responsibility and wild pendulum swings between child and woman the story encourages parents to nurture their daughters strengths not just their traditions the girls hair is practically a character in its own right so much time is spent on its rendering just as it is in most teen girls lives if youre of celtic background this will be a particular delight there are stereotypes of celtic behavior but how do you ground a cultural story without them enjoy 
this is a great family movie with a good story the colors add to this vivid experience the characters all build to a funny and interesting show 
it was really great to see a disney fantasy fairy tale ish movie where the heroine didnt go ga ga over a prince the animation is lovely as always and the voices are a perfect fit 
this is a great movie for parents to watch with their kids it isone of those movies that puts scenes in just for the parents to enjoy i am nbot big on cartoons and i really enjoyed it 
this is a really fun movie the whole family loved it we saw it at the theater and decided to buy it 
i find this to be a well rounded movie the complexity of the mother daughter relationship is difficult without taking away from the lightheartedness one wants from an animation and theres really no villain the heroes are their own villains and i tear up every time but im a bit of a sap 
everyone in my family loves it we have watched it over and over was a little nervous my grandson who is might be afraid of the bear he absolutely loves the movie 
from start to finish this movie was fun to watch the characters in this movie were funny and serious you feel for the main character and are worried about her predicament this movie is as good as any pixar movie and i would highly recommend for anyone and any age group 
this movie is visually spectacular if you know anything about what it takes to computer generate hair and fur you will appreciate this artistic effort even more i spent a lot of time watching meridas curls as for the story its about the age old struggle regarding family values tradition self fulfillment and the willingness to see the world through anothers eyes its a coming of age story for not only the teenage protagonist merida but for all the people around her in a way disney is showing us how they are learning this lesson they have been of the old belief that there must be a one dimensional villain their latest collaborations with pixar has prodded them to change this yes there is a peripheral big bad monster but he is on the edges of the story and not a direct driver of the story in this movie the village is obsessed with the fear and loathing of bears because of peculiar circumstance they learn that maybe bears arent so bad after all thats not the main story line but it is a lesson to think about
